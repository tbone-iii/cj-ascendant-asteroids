                    "text": "King Charles is riding in style at Trooping the Colour. The monarch, 75, attended the annual public celebration of his birthday on June 15 in London, marking the second Trooping the Colour of his royal reign. The event, featuring a stunning procession of military personnel and a Royal Air Force flypast soaring through the skies over the city, has marked the British monarch's official birthday for over 260 years. It was confirmed on May 30 that King Charles would attend the event amid his cancer treatment with a small change in his participation. Instead of riding on horseback as he did in previous years, the royal took part in the procession seated in a horse-drawn carriage alongside Queen Camilla. For the ceremony, the King wore the tunic of the Guard of Honour Order made of bearskin with a blue garter sash, in honor of the regiment's color being trooped, with the cypher of his mother and predecessor, Queen Elizabeth and decorations of Noble Order military and knight garters. King Charles also wore a selection of medals, including Queen Elizabeth’s 1953 Coronation medal, along with the late monarch's jubilee medals from throughout her reign, from the silver to platinum, obtained in 2022. Camilla, meanwhile, wore a pale green silk crepe dress and coat by Anna Valentine and a hat by favored royal designer Philip Treacy. The monarch, who is Colonel-in-Chief of the Grenadier Guards, accessorized her look with her Grenadier Guards military brooch. Queen Elizabeth switched from participating in the event on horseback to riding in a coach when she was 60, 15 years younger than her heir is now. The history-making monarch, who died in Sept. 2022, last rode during Trooping the Colour in 1986 on her beloved horse Burmese. King Charles first attended Trooping the Colour at age 3 when it celebrated his grandfather, King George VI. For his debut, the future monarch rode in a carriage with his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and his aunt, Princess Margaret. His mother, the then-Princess Elizabeth before acceded the throne the following year, was riding horseback in the procession. Last year, King Charles was joined by Prince William, Prince Edward (a first for the Duke of Edinburgh!) and Princess Anne on horseback while other members of the royal family rode in carriages. Members of the royal family again joined King Charles on the big day, including his daughter-in-law Kate Middleton in her first public appearance since announcing her cancer diagnosis in March. The Princess of Wales, 42, shared her plan to attend Trooping the Colour on the day prior, writing in a personal message, \"I’m looking forward to attending the King’s Birthday Parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer, but equally knowing I am not out of the woods yet.\" A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said on June 14, \"His Majesty is delighted that the princess is able to attend tomorrow’s events and is much looking forward to all elements of the day.\" Can't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage? Sign up for our free Royals newsletter to get the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle and more! The Trooping the Colour festivities began when the procession departed Buckingham Palace, heading down The Mall in London to Horse Guards Parade at St. James’ Park. There, King Charles and other members of the royal family will watch the Irish Guards \"troop their colour,” or present their flag. King Charles, Queen Camilla and the rest of the royal family will then travel back to Buckingham Palace, where they will gather on the royal residence's iconic balcony to watch the flypast. There was speculation if King Charles' birthday parade would proceed as normal this year. King Charles and Prince William canceled scheduled engagements after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced on May 22 that a general election would be held in July after Buckingham Palace said the royals would postpone outings \"which may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign.\" Each event would be assessed on a case-by-case basis, and the Ministry of Defense confirmed on May 29 that Trooping the Colour would go on as scheduled. According to the British Army, the ceremonial presentation of the military's regimental flags, called \"colours,\" is believed to have first been performed during the reign of King Charles II, who ruled from 1660 to 1685. The parade was first formally linked to the monarch’s birthday during the reign of King George II in 1748 and got a permanent spot on the royal calendar following the accession of King George III in 1760. The celebration is typically held in June and serves as an official birthday celebration for the monarch, regardless of when their actual birthday is for a practical reason: the promise of better weather!",

King Charles III and his daughter-in-law Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, made a grand appearance at the public celebration despite their health battles. Saturday’s festivities mark Kate’s first public appearance since announcing her cancer diagnosis in March. It’s also the 42-year-old's first official outing since Christmas.

KATE MIDDLETON TO MAKE FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE SINCE CANCER DIAGNOSIS, SAYS CHEMO TREATMENT WILL CONTINUE Trooping the Colour takes place in June each year to celebrate the monarch’s birthday, regardless of when their actual birthday is. The annual event highlights the ceremonial presentation of the military’s flags or \"colours.\" \"The very first Trooping the Colour, ironically, was instigated by King Charles II in the 1600s,\" Christopher Andersen, author of \"The King,\" told Fox News Digital. \"But it wasn’t until Edward VII inherited the throne from his mother, Queen Victoria, in 1901 that they moved the date,\" Andersen explained. \"King Charles III’s birthday is November… Well, King Edward’s birthday was also in November, and he didn’t like the weather then. So he said, ‘It’s much nicer to have a parade in June.’ And so, they moved the day to either the first week, the first Saturday in June, or the second Saturday in June. And it’s been that way ever since.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER \"The queen used this [day] as a way to connect with her people,\" Andersen continued. \"… She never missed one. She only missed one Trooping the Colour during her entire 70-year reign. And that was in 1955 because it was canceled. The entire event was canceled due to a rail strike… She showed up every single time that she could.\" According to the royal family’s website, over 14000 parading soldiers, 200 horses and 400 musicians come together to mark the sovereign’s birthday. The parade highlights the royal family on horseback and in carriages. The palace previously confirmed that Charles will be seated in a horse-drawn carriage alongside Queen Camilla. During last year’s Trooping the Colour, Charles was on horseback alongside Prince William and Prince Edward. \"People may remember that in 1981, while [the queen] was on her horse and her uniform, a person who, at the time was slightly unhinged, fired off blanks… near the horse,\" said Andersen. \"The horse bolted in front of everybody in the middle of the parade. She managed to get control of the horse. It was a wonderful moment for the monarchy because it showed that she was still very much in control.\" LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

But for the royal women, including Queen Camilla, the Princess of Wales, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, they will showcase their royal fashion with stylish, head-turning hats. The Prince and Princess of Wales’s three children – Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis – have made their mark in previous years with adorable moments on the palace balcony. Other royals who may appear on the palace balcony include Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, as well as the Duke of Kent and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were not invited to Trooping the Colour for the second year in a row. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped back as senior royals in 2020 and moved to California. It’s unclear if Prince Andrew will appear at Trooping the Colour. The Duke of York announced he was stepping back as a senior royal in 2019 following his relationship with late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. According to the palace, the king will arrive at the Horse Guard’s Parade in Whitehouse. He will be greeted with a royal salute before inspecting the troops. After the military bands perform, the escorted Regimental Colour, or flag, is processed down the ranks of soldiers. Over 100 words of command are used by the Officer in Command of the Parade to direct hundreds of soldiers.

The king then joins other members of the royal family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to watch a fly-past by the Royal Air Force. The event concludes with a 41-gun salute fired in Green Park.",

                    "text": "LONDON (AP) — Britain put on a display of birthday pageantry Saturday for King Charles III, a military parade that marked the Princess of Wales ’ first public appearance since her cancer diagnosis early this year. The annual event was also a show of stability by the monarchy after months in which both the king and Kate, wife of heir to the throne Prince William, have been sidelined by cancer treatment. Kate announced Friday that she would attend the King’s Birthday Parade after making progress in her treatment. She disclosed in March that she was undergoing chemotherapy for an unspecified form of cancer. “I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days,” Kate said in a statement, adding that she faces “a few more months” of treatment. The 42-year-old princess traveled in horse-drawn carriage from Buckingham Palace down the grand avenue known as the Mall with her children George, 10, Charlotte, 9, and 6-year-old Louis. Bystanders cheered as they caught a glimpse of Kate, dressed in a white dress by designer Jenny Packham and wide-brimmed Philip Treacy hat. She watched the ceremony with the children from the window of a building overlooking Horse Guards Parade, a ceremonial parade ground in central London. Louis yawned broadly at one point in proceedings but mostly watched intently. Kate was likely to join other members of the family on a Buckingham Palace balcony to watch a flypast of military aircraft — and delight the crowds below. The princess has not made any public appearances since December. Kate said in her statement that she is “not out of the woods yet” and officials stress that Saturday’s engagement does not herald a full return to public life. Huge crowds turn out each June to watch the parade, also known as Trooping the Color, which begins with a procession involving horses, musicians and hundreds of soldiers in ceremonial uniform from Buckingham Palace. Prince William, in military dress uniform, rode on horseback for the ceremony, in which troops in ceremonial finery parade past the king with their regimental flag, or “color.” The display of precision marching and martial music stems from the days when a regiment’s flag was an essential rallying point in the fog of battle. Charles, who also is being treated for an undisclosed form of cancer, traveled in a carriage with Queen Camilla, rather than on horseback as he did last year. The king inspected the troops from a dais on the parade ground, saluting as elite regiments of Foot Guards marched past. Five regiments take it in turns to parade their color, and this year it was the turn of a company of the Irish Guards, which has Kate as its honorary colonel. The troops in scarlet tunics and bearskin hats were led onto the parade ground by their mascot, an Irish wolfhound named Seamus. Charles, 75, disclosed his cancer in February, and has recently eased back into public duties. He attended commemorations last week for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe on June 6, 1944. In one of the many quirks of British royal convention, Saturday is not the king’s real birthday — that’s in November. Like his mother Queen Elizabeth II before him, Charles has an official birthday on the second Saturday in June. The date was chosen because the weather is generally good, though early sunshine on Saturday gave way to a blustery, rainy day in London. The rain held off for most of the ceremony but began pelting down as the massed troops escorted the royal carriages back to Buckingham Palace, to cheers from soggy but enthusiastic crowds. Royal fans in raincoats and umbrellas had already gathered along the route several hours before start time, along with a smattering of anti-monarchist protesters chanting “Not my king.” Spectators were treated to a display of pomp and precision involving 1,400 soldiers, 250 military musicians and more than 200 horses. The equine participants included Trojan, Tennyson, and Vanquish, three of the five military horses who sparked mayhem in April when they bolted and ran loose through central London. The horses were performing routine exercises near Buckingham Palace on April 24 when they became spooked by noise from a nearby building site and galloped loose through the capital’s streets, crashing into vehicles and causing chaos during the morning rush hour. The army says the other two horses are recovering well and are also expected to return to duty.",

                    "text": "Though Princess Kate has attended Trooping the Colour many times in the past, this year holds a special significance, as it marks her first official public engagement since attending Christmas Day church services with the royal family late last year. It comes nearly three months after the princess revealed the shocking news that she had been diagnosed with cancer. Kate was seen early in the day, spotted in the back of a car with her children and husband, Prince William. She could be seen through the vehicle's window wearing a white ensemble edged in black, complete with a hat, with her hair pulled back. The dress is by one of the Princess of Wales' go-to designers, Jenny Packham, and the hat is designed by another royal favorite, Philip Treacy. Kate’s presence at Trooping the Colour 2024 was only confirmed on Friday afternoon, less than 24 hours before the traditional parade in honor of the monarch’s birthday—one of the highlights of the annual royal calendar—was set to begin. In the caption of an Instagram post on the official account that she shares with Prince William, Kate shared a message of thanks and hope, along with her scheduling news. “I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days,” she wrote. “On those bad days you feel weak, tired and you have to give in to your body resting. But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well.” Kate shared that her treatment is “ongoing and will be for a few more months,” and expressed hope that she would “join a few public engagements over the summer” beyond Trooping the Colour, tempering expectations by saying that she is “not out of the woods yet.” Sources recently told Vanity Fair that the princess has “turned a corner” in her cancer treatment lately, though she was notably absent from both the St. Patrick’s Day parade and the Colonel’s Review on June 8, both events that she would typically preside over in her role as Honorary Colonel of the Irish Guards. The year has been an unusual one for the royal family, Kate in particular. In January, it was announced by Kensington Palace that the princess had undergone a “planned abdominal surgery” with a lengthy recovery time and a tentative return to her royal duties after Easter. Sources initially stressed that the unspecified procedure was “noncancerous” in nature, but tests after the surgery revealed the opposite. The Princess of Wales’s whereabouts were the subject of rampant speculation until her public announcement of her diagnosis, wherein she asked for “time, space, and privacy” for herself and her family as she underwent treatment. Her cancer revelation came mere weeks after her father-in-law, King Charles, shared his own cancer diagnosis with the public, also following an early 2024 procedure, his to treat an enlarged prostate. After Kate’s announcement, Charles shared a statement of support for the princess, saying that he was “so proud of Catherine for her courage in speaking as she did.” Charles has since returned to a somewhat lightened schedule of public-facing duties while receiving treatment, and according to palace sources, his attendance at Trooping the Colour was “non-negotiable.” His one concession: Inspecting the troops while riding in a carriage rather than on horseback.",

                    "text": "Kate Middleton officially returned to the Buckingham Palace balcony at the 2024 Trooping the Colour parade on Saturday following her abdominal surgery and subsequent cancer diagnosis in March. The Princess of Wales, 42, was initially spotted standing beside Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis looking at the pageantry below. Moments later, during the Flypast, she stood beside her husband, Prince Wiliam, her children, King Charles III and Queen Camilla, among other members of the royal family. As planes flew overheard, they all waved towards the crowds below. Before that, royal fans saw Middleton being driven to the parade in a car along with her children and William. While Middleton was originally not expected to attend the Trooping the Colour parade — which celebrates the official birthday of the British Sovereign, King Charles III — she pleasantly surprised fans Friday when she confirmed she would make her return to public-facing duties at the event. “I’m looking forward to attending the king’s birthday parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer, but equally knowing I am not out of the woods yet,” she said in a statement that included new photos of her taken in Windsor, England. “I am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty. Taking each day as it comes, listening to my body and allowing myself to take this much needed time to heal.” The exciting news came weeks after an insider told Vanity Fair Middleton was “doing a lot better” following her diagnosis. Little has been divulged about her health since she announced she had cancer in March, but fans got an idea when Easter came and went and she had not returned to her official duties. William, however, went back to work in April after a brief hiatus when he visited the nonprofit organization Surplus to Supper in Surrey, England. He gave a small update regarding his wife’s well-being while visiting northern England on April 30, where he responded to a concerned fan who asked how she and their children — Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 6 — were doing. “All doing well, yes, thank you. All doing well,” he replied. Middleton’s last official public appearance was on Christmas Day when she joined her family for a church service at St. Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham, England. Just weeks later, Kensington Palace announced she underwent a “planned abdominal surgery.” “The surgery was successful and it is expected that she will remain in hospital for ten to fourteen days, before returning home to continue her recovery,” the official statement noted.

As Middleton remained out of the spotlight, conspiracy theories about her whereabouts grew — with some fans even claiming she used a body double for a photo of her smiling with William captured at a farm shop on March 16. On March 22, the mother of three addressed the public and revealed she had been undergoing treatment for cancer. “It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment. But, most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them and to reassure them that I am going to be OK,” she explained in her announcement video — which did not include Prince William, 41. “As I have said to them, I am well and getting stronger every day by focusing on the things thatwill help me heal, in my mind, body and spirits.”",

                    "text": "LONDON -- Britain put on a display of birthday pageantry Saturday for King Charles III, a military parade that marked the Princess of Wales ' first public appearance since her cancer diagnosis early this year. The annual event was also a show of stability by the monarchy after months in which both the king and Kate, wife of heir to the throne Prince William, have been sidelined by cancer treatment. Kate announced Friday that she would attend the King's Birthday Parade after making progress in her treatment. She disclosed in March that she was undergoing chemotherapy for an unspecified form of cancer. \"I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days,\" Kate said in a statement, adding that she faces \"a few more months\" of treatment. The 42-year-old princess traveled in horse-drawn carriage from Buckingham Palace down the grand avenue known as the Mall with her children George, 10, Charlotte, 9, and 6-year-old Louis. Bystanders cheered as they caught a glimpse of Kate, dressed in a white dress by designer Jenny Packham and wide-brimmed Philip Treacy hat. She watched the ceremony with the children from the window of a building overlooking Horse Guards Parade, a ceremonial parade ground in central London. Louis yawned broadly at one point in proceedings but mostly watched intently. Kate was likely to join other members of the family on a Buckingham Palace balcony to watch a flypast of military aircraft - and delight the crowds below. The princess has not made any public appearances since December. Kate said in her statement that she is \"not out of the woods yet\" and officials stress that Saturday's engagement does not herald a full return to public life. Huge crowds turn out each June to watch the parade, also known as Trooping the Color, which begins with a procession involving horses, musicians and hundreds of soldiers in ceremonial uniform from Buckingham Palace. Prince William, in military dress uniform, rode on horseback for the ceremony, in which troops in ceremonial finery parade past the king with their regimental flag, or \"color.\" The display of precision marching and martial music stems from the days when a regiment's flag was an essential rallying point in the fog of battle. Charles, who also is being treated for an undisclosed form of cancer, traveled in a carriage with Queen Camilla, rather than on horseback as he did last year. The king inspected the troops from a dais on the parade ground, saluting as elite regiments of Foot Guards marched past. Five regiments take it in turns to parade their color, and this year it was the turn of a company of the Irish Guards, which has Kate as its honorary colonel. The troops in scarlet tunics and bearskin hats were led onto the parade ground by their mascot, an Irish wolfhound named Seamus. Charles, 75, disclosed his cancer in February, and has recently eased back into public duties. He attended commemorations last week for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe on June 6, 1944. In one of the many quirks of British royal convention, Saturday is not the king's real birthday - that's in November. Like his mother Queen Elizabeth II before him, Charles has an official birthday on the second Saturday in June. The date was chosen because the weather is generally good, though early sunshine on Saturday gave way to a blustery, rainy day in London. The rain held off for most of the ceremony but began pelting down as the massed troops escorted the royal carriages back to Buckingham Palace, to cheers from soggy but enthusiastic crowds. Royal fans in raincoats and umbrellas had already gathered along the route several hours before start time, along with a smattering of anti-monarchist protesters chanting \"Not my king.\" Spectators were treated to a display of pomp and precision involving 1,400 soldiers, 250 military musicians and more than 200 horses. The equine participants included Trojan, Tennyson, and Vanquish, three of the five military horses who sparked mayhem in April when they bolted and ran loose through central London. The horses were performing routine exercises near Buckingham Palace on April 24 when they became spooked by noise from a nearby building site and galloped loose through the capital's streets, crashing into vehicles and causing chaos during the morning rush hour. The army says the other two horses are recovering well and are also expected to return to duty.",

                    "text": "As promised, Kate Middleton made her first public appearance in months as the Princess of Wales joined the Royal Family Saturday at the Trooping the Colour ceremony in London celebrating King Charles III’s “official” birthday. Despite “lashing rain,” as the BBC put it, and a canopy-less balcony outside Buckingham Palace, the Royal Family — including Middleton and King Charles, who like the Princess is also battling cancer but has since returned to public-facing duties, as well as Prince William and the couple’s three children — all gathered outside to take in the festivities. Prior to the event Saturday, Middleton posted a video of the family preparing for the proceedings on social media: The Trooping the Colour ceremony was Middleton’s first official public appearance since December, weeks before she was admitted to a London Clinic Jan. 16 for what was “planned” non-cancerous abdominal surgery, according to a statement from Kensington Palace. Middleton remain hospitalized for 10 to 14 days, followed by at-home recovery. However, Middleton’s weeks-long absence sparked much tabloid speculation, which was further inflamed in part when the Princess of Wales shared a poorly Photoshopped family photo with the press. The rumors didn’t desist until March, when Middleton revealed in a video statement that she had cancer. “At the time, it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous,” she said at the time. “The surgery was successful, however, tests after the operation on cancer had been present.” On Friday, Middleton offered an update on her health battle, as well as announced she would appear at the Trooping the Colour ceremony. “I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days,” Middleton shared in a statement. “On those bad days you feel weak, tired and you have to give in to your body resting. But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well. My treatment is ongoing and will be for a few more months. On the days I feel well enough, it is a joy to engage with school life, spend personal time on the things that give me energy and positivity, as well as starting to do a little work from home.” She continued, “I’m looking forward to attending The King’s Birthday Parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer, but equally knowing I am not out of the woods yet. I am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty. Taking each day as it comes, listening to my body, and allowing myself to take this much needed time to heal. Thank you so much for your continued understanding, and to all of you who have so bravely shared your stories with me.”",

On Saturday, the princess attended King Charles III‘s birthday parade, known as the Trooping the Color, held six months before his birthday amid his own cancer diagnosis. Middleton occupied the window seat in a carriage, smiling and waving to onlookers, and appeared on the balcony at Buckingham Palace. The parade is the most anticipated ceremony of the monarchy on the calendar, featuring 1,400 extravagantly dressed parading soldiers, 400 musicians, and 242 military horses. The Princess of Wales was joined by nearly all members of the royal family. The king (or queen) usually rides on a horse in the parade, but due to King Charles’s health he opted to instead ride in a carriage. After a procession down the Mall, the parade ended at Buckingham Palace, where Middleton appeared alongside her husband, children, king, and the rest of the royal family. The royal family watched a Royal Air Force contingent do a flyover at the conclusion of the ceremony. The Princess of Wales was the target of intense speculation earlier this year, after people noticed that she had disappeared from public view for months. After a preponderance of conspiracy theories, she finally revealed that she had been diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing treatment. Notably, she missed the recent D-Day celebrations attended by King Charlies, commemorating the Allied landings in Normandy and the liberation of France from Nazi occupation. She announced her intention to attend the Trooping the Color and other events over the summer on Friday, as well as sharing her optimism. “I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days. On those bad days you feel weak, tired and you have to give in to your body resting. But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well,” the princess wrote on Instagram. “On the days I feel well enough, it is a joy to engage with school life, spend personal time on the things that give me energy and positivity, as well as starting to do a little work from home.” She added that she’s “not out of the woods yet.” Trooping the Color is believed to have originated during the reign of the last King Charles, King Charles II, who reigned 1660-1685. It was determined in 1748 that the ceremony should mark the monarch’s birthday, which it has ever since. The ceremony features regimental colors, which were vital in maintaining cohesion and discipline on the battlefield before the onset of modern warfare. The United Kingdom’s five regiments of Foot guards, Grenadier, Coldstream, Scots, Irish, and Welsh, rotate each year, with only one taking part per year. This year’s parade featured the Welsh Guards.",

The Princess of Wales attended the 2024 Trooping the Colour, celebrating King Charles’ birthday on Saturday. She stood on the balcony with her husband, Prince William, and their three children — George, Charlotte and Louis. On Friday, Middleton shared that she would be returning to some royal duties this summer, starting with the king’s celebration, while she continues to undergo cancer treatment. “I have been blown away by all the kind messages of support and encouragement over the last couple of months,” she wrote on social media Friday. “It really has made the world of difference to William and me and has helped us both through some of the harder times. I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days. On those bad days you feel weak, tired and you have to give in to your body resting. But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well.” The annual celebration of the monarch’s birthday marked Middleton’s first appearance back in the spotlight after stepping back from her royal duties in January while recovering from a routine surgery. After months of speculation about the princess’ health, with some conspiracy theories going as far as to say she was missing, Middleton announced in a video that she had been diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing treatment. In her Friday social media post, the princess also provided an update on her health, writing, “My treatment is ongoing and will be for a few more months. On the days I feel well enough, it is a joy to engage with school life, spend personal time on the things that give me energy and positivity, as well as starting to do a little work from home.”",

                    "text": "Prince William proudly stood by Kate Middleton’s side for her first public appearance of 2024. The Prince of Wales, 41, was seen giving his wife, 42, a sweet nudge during Trooping the Colour Saturday. “The way she looks at him, the way he leans and touches her arm. Lost in their little world?♥️,” one royal fan remarked of the tender moment via X Saturday. William, who donned his ceremonial red tunic for the special event, appeared happy to finally have Middleton by his side again after attending most of his royal engagements solo the past six months. Middleton, for her part, looked regal in a chic white dress designed by Jenny Packham. All eyes were on the princess as she rode through London in a carriage with their children — Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 9, and Prince Louis, 6 — during King Charles III’s annual birthday parade. Once they made it to Buckingham Palace, Middleton — who announced her cancer diagnosis in March — posed on the balcony for the royal family’s annual photo op. Despite rumors the Princess of Wales wouldn’t make it to the royal event, she announced Friday that she was feeling up to it. “I’m looking forward to attending the king’s birthday parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer, but equally knowing I am not out of the woods yet,” she said in a statement. “I am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty. Taking each day as it comes, listening to my body and allowing myself to take this much needed time to heal.” Although Middleton assured fans that she was “making good progress” with her chemotherapy, she explained that there are still “good days and bad days.” “On those bad days you feel weak, tired and you have to give in to your body resting,” she wrote. “But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well.” While her “treatment is ongoing and will be for a few more months,” she has slowly started to incorporate more into her daily routine. The mom of three said, “On the days I feel well enough, it is a joy to engage with school life, spend personal time on the things that give me energy and positivity, as well as starting to do a little work from home.” Despite the “harder times,” Middleton thanked her supporters for their encouragement and kind messages, which “made the world of [a] difference to William and [her].”",

                    "text": "Catherine, Princess of Wales, made her first public appearance Saturday morning since announcing her cancer diagnosis about three months ago. The former Kate Middleton, 42, returned to public view while attending the annual Trooping the Colour, a parade to mark the birthday of King Charles III. On the way to the event, England's future queen, dressed in white, smiled and waved to spectators from her carriage. Her three children sat with her, while Prince William rode on horseback to the parade. Later in the day, Kate stood beside the royal family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to watch a Royal Air Force fly over. Kate's appearance was not a complete surprise. On Friday evening, she released a statement, announcing her plans to attend the celebration, adding that she had a few more months left in her chemotherapy treatment and she was making \"good progress.\" \"I’m looking forward to attending The King’s Birthday Parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer, but equally knowing I am not out of the woods yet,\" she wrote on Instagram. Kate publicly shared that she was in the early stages of chemotherapy in late March after virtually disappearing from public view in late December. At the time, Kensington Palace said Kate's absence from public engagements was due to a planned abdominal surgery. At the time, the palace said the treatment was not for cancer. A few weeks before the princess announced her diagnosis, the palace disclosed that Charles, 75, also began undergoing cancer treatments. The palace has not shared what type of cancers either Charles or Kate have.",

In a clip circulating online, the Princess of Wales could be seen giggling as she briefly chatted with the monarch, who laughed in response. “Look at the natural closeness and warmth between King Charles and the Princess of Wales,” a social media user wrote via X Saturday. “He adores her. Princess Catherine is like a daughter to him. We’re so lucky to have her in our #RoyalFamily Britain’s future Queen.” The two royals are known to have always had a good relationship but may have grown even closer in the last few months as they both battle cancer. In March, Middleton and Charles reportedly sat down for a private lunch to discuss their “common health experience.” A month prior, Buckingham Palace announced the King, 75, had been diagnosed with cancer following a “routine hospital procedure for benign prostate enlargement.” He then temporarily stepped back from royal duties to concentrate on treatment. Royal fans were shocked when Middleton, 42, announced in March that she, too, had been diagnosed with cancer after undergoing abdominal surgery. In an emotional video, the princess confessed that the health issue “came as a huge shock.” After spending some months privately undergoing chemotherapy, Middleton made her first pubic comeback Saturday to participate in the King’s annual birthday parade. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson told Page Six Friday that Charles was “delighted” the princess was able to attend and was “looking forward to all elements of the day.” On the morning of the parade, Middleton shared a tender moment with her 9-year-old daughter, Princess Charlotte, in which she was seen gently stroking the little girl’s hair. She then happily rode in a carriage with all three of her kids, which also include Prince George, 10, and Prince Louis, 6, before posing with the other royal family members at the Buckingham Palace balcony.",

The 42-year-old Princess of Wales joined her husband, Prince William, and their three children — Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis — at Trooping the Colour, a ceremonial parade in honor of King Charles' birthday, held on Saturday. The event not only marked her first public outing in six months, but also her first since revealing her cancer diagnosis in March. Middleton, who has attended Trooping the Colour every year (except for during the COVID-19 pandemic), took part in the festivities by riding in a horse-drawn coach with her kids throughout London. She later appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace alongside William, their children, Queen Camilla, and King Charles III, who is also battling cancer, and several other members of the royal family.

                    "text": "Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales, made her first public appearance of 2024 at Saturday’s Trooping the Colour parade. She was joined by all three of her children alongside Prince William three months after revealing her cancer diagnosis in March. Thousands of people turned out in horrible weather to see Middleton and the family as they celebrated the ceremonial birthday of King Charles. Despite currently receiving chemotherapy treatment, Middleton beamed throughout the day’s events and appeared healthy and fit. Unlike years past, this year, Middleton and her children watched the parade together on a smaller balcony. Typically, senior members of the royal family congregate on a dais together to take in the day’s events. King Charles, who announced his own diagnosis of cancer in February, and Queen Camilla led the parade in a glass carriage. In another change from previous years, Charles inspected his troops from inside the carriage, instead of on horseback on the street. The King was escorted by the Irish Guards, who were joined by their mascot, an Irish Wolfhound named Seamus. Prince William, Princess Anne and Prince Edward each rode on horseback throughout the parade. Prince Andrew did not join the family. The royal family came out onto a balcony together at the parade’s end to watch the RAF fly over Buckingham Palace. The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh and their daughter Lady Louise also appeared alongside Princess Anne, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, the Duke of Kent, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. The Prince and Princess of Wales announced Middleton’s intention to join the family for Trooping the Colour on Friday on social media. “I have been blown away by all the kind messages of support and encouragement over the last couple of months. It really has made the world of difference to William and me and has helped us both through some of the harder times,” she wrote. “I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days. On those bad days you feel weak, tired and you have to give in to your body resting. But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well,” Middleton added. “My treatment is ongoing and will be for a few more months. On the days I feel well enough, it is a joy to engage with school life, spend personal time on the things that give me energy and positivity, as well as starting to do a little work from home. I’m looking forward to attending The King’s Birthday Parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer, but equally knowing I am not out of the woods yet.” The statement concluded, “I am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty. Taking each day as it comes, listening to my body, and allowing myself to take this much needed time to heal. Thank you so much for your continued understanding, and to all of you who have so bravely shared your stories with me.” Middleton was the subject of weeks of scrutiny and investigation after she underwent surgery on Jan. 16.

The matchup is available on multiple streaming services for free. Today’s game will broadcast live on FOX and is scheduled for noon Eastern. (6 p.m. Central European Summer Time). Fans who have parted ways with their local cable provider can catch the game for free by utilizing streaming alternatives like FuboTV and DirecTV Stream, which both offer a free trial. Sling TV is also offering promotional discounts for new customers. Here’s more information on how to watch Spain-Croatia on TV and streaming services. What: Spain vs. Croatia: Euro 2024 Group B When: Saturday, June 15, 2024 Time: Noon. Eastern (6 p.m. Central European Summer Time) Where: Olympiastadion | Berlin, Germany Channels: FOX Best streaming options: FuboTV (free trial), DirecTV Stream (free trial), Sling TV (promotional offers for new customers) Cable Channel Finder: AT&T U-Verse, Comcast Xfinity, Spectrum/Charter, Optimum/Altice, Cox, DirecTv, Dish, Verizon Fios Croatia notched a 2-1 win over Spain in the group stages of Euro 2016 but Spain knocked them out in the final 16 of Euro 2020 and they were eliminated by Portugal in the final 16 of 2016. Croatia has never advanced past the quarterfinals of the Euro’s. During the last two years of international play, the Spainards have scored 38 goals while Croatia has allowed just seven. The Croatians have scored 22 goals while Spain has given up just 10. It’s a classic matchup of the youthfulness of Spain vs. the veteran style of Croatia. Since La Roja turned to Louis de la Fuenta, they play less ball control and more dissecting and flash offense with a bit of a suspect defense. Will that style work against the Vatreni? The Croatians have not beaten Spain since November 2018. Despite only one loss in Spain’s last 12 matches, look for an even match with both sides clinging to small advantages on the pitch. A tie is not only possible, but likely in the heavyweight battle. Whoever pulls the precious points will take a large step in reaching the next stage, but nothing is guaranteed with superpower Italy in the mix. Spain players to watch Alex Grimaldo had 10 goals and 12 assists in 33 matches for Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga this past season.

Hungary are being tipped as one of the dark horses tipped for success in Germany, with Marco Rossi's side having lost just one of their last 14 internationals since the beginning of 2023. They come up against a Swiss side that were unconvincing in qualification, finishing second in their group behind Romania, however a confident 4-0 warm up match win over Estonia followed by a solid draw against Austria may have raised expectations. Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch the game live, wherever you are in the world. Hungary vs. Switzerland: When and where? Hungary take on Switzerland on Saturday, June 15, at the RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne. Kick-off is set for 3 p.m. CET local time in Germany, making it a 2 p.m. BST start in the UK. In the US and Canada it's a 9 a.m. ET or 6 a.m. PT start, while the game gets underway at 11 p.m. AEST in Australia. How to watch every Euro 2024 game online from anywhere using a VPN If you find yourself unable to view Euro 2024 matches locally, you may need a different way to watch the tournament -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins. With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this. Using a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions. Looking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the other great VPN deals taking place right now.

First, log into your streaming service subscription account and make sure the address registered for the account is an address in the correct viewing area. If not, you may need to change the physical address on file with your account. Second, some smart TVs -- like Roku -- don't have VPN apps you can install directly on the device itself. Instead, you'll have to install the VPN on your router or the mobile hotspot you're using (like your phone) so that any device on its Wi-Fi network now appears in the correct viewing location.All of the VPN providers we recommend have helpful instructions on their main site for quickly installing the VPN on your router. In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network's sports app, you'll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV. This is where having a VPN on your router will also help, since both devices will appear to be in the correct location. And remember, browsers can often give away a location despite using a VPN, so be sure you're using a privacy-first browser to log into your services. We normally recommend Brave.",

                    "text": "England face Namibia on Saturday, knowing that anything less than a win will see them eliminated from the year's T20 World Cup. After suffering a 36-run defeat to Australia last weekend, Jos Buttler's side got back to winning ways with an eight-wicket victory over Oman on Thursday, and another strong victory is required today if they're to ensure they reach the Super 8s instead of Scotland. They face a Namibia side unable to qualify for the knockouts after their battling defeats to Australia and Scotland. Nevertheless, after a creditable showing in their first appearance in the tournament since 2012, the Eagles will be determined to bow out in style with a shock win here. Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to watch the final match of the series, no matter where you are in the world. Namibia v England: When and where? Namibia take on England at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound, West Indies, on Saturday, June 15. Play is set to start at 1 p.m. ET, 10 a.m. PT. That makes it a 6 p.m. BST start in the UK, an 10:30 p.m. IST start in India, a 10p.m. start in Pakistan. The game meanwhile gets underway at 3 a.m. for viewers in Australia early on Sunday morning. How to watch online from anywhere using a VPN If you find yourself unable to view this T20i locally, you may need a different way to watch this match -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic. It's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins. With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this. Using a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Australia, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. Be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.

Quick tips for streaming Namibia vs. England using a VPN With four variables at play -- your ISP, browser, video streaming provider and VPN -- your experience and success when streaming this T20i match live may vary.If you don't see your desired location as a default option for ExpressVPN, try using the \"search for city or country\" option.If you're having trouble getting the game after you've turned on your VPN and set it to the correct viewing area, there are two things you can try for a quick fix. First, log into your streaming service subscription account and make sure the address registered for the account is in the correct viewing area. If not, you may need to change the physical address on file with your account. Second, some smart TVs -- like Roku -- don't have VPN apps you can install directly on the device itself. Instead, you'll have to install the VPN on your router or the mobile hotspot you're using (like your phone), so that any device on its Wi-Fi network now appears in the correct viewing location.All of the VPN providers we recommend have helpful instructions on their main site for quickly installing the VPN on your router. In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network's sports app, you'll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV. This is where having a VPN on your router will also help, since both devices will appear to be in the correct location. And remember, browsers can often give away a location despite using a VPN, so be sure you're using a privacy-first browser to log into your services. We recommend Brave.",

The latest forecast I’ve seen for Antigua’s airport, about three miles from the ground as the crow flies, is for “thundery showers and a gentle breeze”. If that leads to a no-result, England will crash out of the tournament. They’ll be stranded on four points, still one behind Scotland, who will sail through to the Super Eights before they even meet Australia. The good news is that at least we won’t all be spending the rest of the day banging on about net run rate. The bad news is that we may well be droning on about Duckworth-Lewis-Stern instead. Namibia are already out, even though they registered the first win in this group by beating Oman in a Super Over. For them, it’s a chance to meet England for the first time in T20. The only previous meeting between the two sides was a 50-over game in the 2003 World Cup in South Africa, when England won but Namibia emerged with their heads held high. Andrew Flintoff, now a member of England’s coaching team, played in that match, as did Jimmy Anderson. Play starts, in theory, at 6pm BST (1pm in Antigua), so I hope to be back soon after 5.30pm BST with news of the toss and teams.",

While they are renowned for repeatedly punching above their weight on the world stage, Croatia’s record at the European Championship is not gread and they have never advanced beyond the quarter-finals of this competition. This year could be no excpetion, as Zlatko Dalic’s ageing side have the air about them of The Expendables regrouping for one last job but only a fool would write them off. Having lost at home to Turkey and away to Wales in qualifying, their progress to these finals was not without its hiccups but they are here now and in Luka Modric, Mateo Kovacic and Marcelo Brozovic, have a potential starting midfield trio with 372 caps between them. Managed by Luis de la Fuente and skippered by Alvaro Morata, Spain come into these Euros with the whiff of scandal about them, its roots in the Luis Rubiales fiasco which followed the Women’s World Cup. With these issuses largely restricted to the corridors of power at the headquarters of the Spanish Football Federation, it’s to be hoped the efforts of their entirely blameless players were in any way tainted by association. A healthy mix of youth and experience, they will be looking to whelpish young bucks such as Pedri, Nico Williams and Lamine Yamal, as well as older heads such as Jesus Navas, Rodri, Dani Carvajal and their captain to help steer them through these group stages with a minimum of fuss.

                    "text": "Kate Middleton made a fashion statement at Trooping the Colour. The Princess of Wales, 42, joined the royal family at King Charles' official birthday parade in London on June 15, marking her first public event in six months after she announced in March that she has cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy. At Trooping the Colour, Princess Kate arrived wearing a white Jenny Packham dress with black trim and ribbon embellishment on neckline, her hair swept back beneath a white hat by Philip Treacy. Princess Kate accessorized with earrings that appear to be her Cassandra Goad Cavolfiore Pearl Studs and the Irish Guards Regimental Brooch, nodding to her role as the regiment's honorary colonel, which is trooping its \"colour\" (or flag) today. She traveled by carriage in the Glass State Coach with Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 9, and Prince Louis, 6, before she will join the royal family on the Buckingham Palace balcony later in the day. For last year's Trooping the Colour, she wore a bright green dress by Andrew Gn with a matching hat by Philip Treacy. Gn grew up in Singapore, and Princess Kate's outfit choice was seen by some as a nod to the location of Prince William's Earthshot Prize awards that year. She completed the look with Princess Diana's sapphire and diamond earrings and the Irish Guards' gold shamrock brooch, a fitting accessory for her first Trooping as the regiment's colonel. The Princess of Wales has attended Trooping the Colour every year since marrying Prince William in 2011, except for 2020 and 2021 when the royal event was scaled down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The annual birthday parade for the British monarch is organized by the Household Division of the British Army and is one of the most anticipated events on the royal family's calendar. Kate's attendance at Trooping the Colour was confirmed the day ahead of the big event as she released a new photo and personal letter featuring an update on her ongoing cancer treatment. \"I’m looking forward to attending the King’s Birthday Parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer, but equally knowing I am not out of the woods yet,\" she said in the June 14 letter. While her Trooping outing marked her first royal engagement since December when she joined the family at their traditional Christmas church visit, it does not signal a full return to royal duties. Princess Kate shared her \"hope to join a few public engagements over the summer,\" but upcoming appearances will be based on when she feels able and under the guidance of her medical team. The Princess of Wales acknowledged in her letter, \"I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days. On those bad days, you feel weak, tired and you have to give in to your body resting. But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well.\" Kate added, \"On the days I feel well enough, it is a joy to engage with school life, spend personal time on the things that give me energy and positivity, as well as starting to do a little work from home.\" Hundreds of soldiers, horses and musicians united for Trooping the Colour, continuing a tradition linked to the monarch's official birthday since 1748, according to the British Army. The celebration is usually held in June, regardless of when the reigning monarch's actual birthday may be. (The reason? There's more likely to be parade-friendly weather!) Buckingham Palace previously announced that King Charles, 75, would participate in Trooping the Colour in a different way this year amid his cancer treatment. Instead of riding on horseback as he has in years past, including the first Trooping the Colour of his royal reign in June 2023, the King planned to conduct the review from a carriage alongside Queen Camilla.

Because only one flag, or \"colour,\" can be trooped at a time, the five regiments of the Foot Guards — Grenadier, Coldstream, Scots, Irish and Welsh — rotate annually. Princess Kate is the honorary colonel of the Irish Guards, which is presenting its flag this year. However, the Princess of Wales did not lead the Colonel's Review one week before Trooping and sent a letter expressing her \"apologies.\" \"I wanted to write and let you know how proud I am of the entire regiment ahead of the Colonel's Review and Trooping of the Colour,\" she said in a message circulated on June 8. \"I appreciate everyone trooping this year has been practicing for months and dedicating many hours to ensuring their uniforms and drill are immaculate.\" \"Being your colonel remains a great honor, and I am very sorry that I'm unable to take the salute at this year's Colonel's Review. Please pass my apologies to the whole Regiment, however, I do hope that I am able to represent you all once again very soon,\" she continued. \"Please send my very best wishes and good luck to all involved.\" Princess Kate signed her name as \"Colonel Catherine\" in her own handwriting.",

                    "text": "Kate Middleton was a welcomed sight at Trooping the Colour, making her first royal outing since Christmas amid her cancer diagnosis. The Princess of Wales, 42, joined the royal family at King Charles' birthday parade on June 15. After arriving at Buckingham Palace by car with her family, she took part in the procession by riding in a horse-drawn carriage through London with her three children: Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 9, and Prince Louis, 6. The royal mom, sporting a white dress by Jenny Packham adorned with the Irish Guards Regimental Brooch and paired with a hat by Philip Treacy, and kids traveled in the Glass Coach, shielding them from the rainy weather. The Glass Coach, built in 1881 and purchased for King George V’s coronation in 1911, has brought many royal brides to their weddings, including Princess Anne in 1973, Princess Diana in 1981 and Sarah Ferguson in 1986. Princess Kate has attended Trooping the Colour every year since marrying Prince William in 2011, except for 2020 and 2021 when the event was scaled down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Princess Kate's attendance at King Charles' annual birthday parade was confirmed the day prior as she released a new photo and personal letter featuring an update on her health. After undergoing abdominal surgery in January, the royal announced in an emotional video released on March 22 that post-operative tests led to a cancer diagnosis and that she was undergoing chemotherapy. \"I’m looking forward to attending the King’s Birthday Parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer, but equally knowing I am not out of the woods yet,\" she said in the June 14 message. Her appearance at Trooping the Colour marked the first time she stepped out for a royal event since December when she joined the family at their annual Christmas church visit. Kate made a number of outings that month, from hosting her third annual Christmas carol concert to sporting a tiara for the Diplomatic Reception at Buckingham Palace. While Princess Kate has maintained a low public profile in the months since her cancer announcement as she focuses on recovery, she was recently spotted out with her family as well as running errands solo, sources told PEOPLE. The Princess of Wales said in her June 14 message that she is \"starting to do a little work from home\" and expressed a \"hope to join a few public engagements over the summer,\" but no date has been set for her to fully return to her royal duties. Any outings in the near future will be based on when she feels able and under the guidance of her medical team. Princess Kate did not attend the Colonel's Review, the final rehearsal for Trooping the Colour that took place one week prior on June 8. She is the honorary Colonel of the Irish Guards, who are leading the charge in this year's celebration (only one flag can be trooped at a time, so the five regiments of the Foot Guards — Grenadier, Coldstream, Scots, Irish and Welsh — rotate annually). The Princess of Wales would normally have taken the salute at the Colonel's Review, but the palace announced on May 30 that she would not carry out the moment. Instead, Lieutenant General James Bucknall, a former Commander of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps who has attended every Trooping the Colour since 2009 when he was appointed Colonel of the Coldstream Guards, took the salute at the practice event. In a letter shared with the Irish Guards, Kate said, \"Being your colonel remains a great honor, and I am very sorry that I'm unable to take the salute at this year's Colonel's Review. Please pass my apologies to the whole Regiment, however, I do hope that I am able to represent you all once again very soon. Please send my very best wishes and good luck to all involved.\" The Princess of Wales signed her name as \"Colonel Catherine.\" Amid his own cancer diagnosis and treatment, King Charles attended Trooping the Colour — with a slight change from previous years. Although the monarch, 75, previously appeared on horseback in the procession, he rode in a horse-drawn carriage alongside Queen Camilla for the procession.

                    "text": "She’s back! Kate Middleton delighted royal fans by joining the royal family during Saturday’s Trooping the Colour 2024 event in London, making her first public appearance of the year amid her recovery from cancer. The Princess of Wales, 42 — who announced she had been undergoing chemotherapy for an unspecified form of cancer in March — wore a white long-sleeved coat dress trimmed with a black bow as she rode in a carriage with her children Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 9, and Prince Louis, 6, during King Charles III’s annual birthday parade. The princess almost exclusively wears Alexander McQueen coat dresses to the annual event, and this year, she went with another beloved designer, Jenny Packham. Middleton — who shared a moving Instagram post on Friday announcing her appearance at Trooping the Colour, which she has attended every year since her marriage — wore her hair pulled back and accessorized with a matching black-and-white Philip Treacy hat and her much-loved Cassandra Goad pearl earrings ($6,061). She also added what appears to be a brooch representing the insignia of the Irish Guards, of which she serves as the honorary colonel. As for the royal children, Princes George and Louis both looked dapper in a double-breasted suit and blue tie, while Princess Charlotte chose a navy blue look trimmed with a white bow to match her mother, sporting another white bow in her hair. Queen Camilla also coordinated with Middleton in an all-white look that included an oversized hat and simple coat dress. Although a fan spotted the Prince and Princess of Wales shopping at a farm shop in Windsor on March 16, Saturday’s parade marks the first time the mom of three has formally attended an event since Christmas 2023. “I’m looking forward to attending the king’s birthday parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer, but equally knowing I am not out of the woods yet,” the Princess of Wales wrote on Instagram Friday. “I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there aregood days and bad days,” she added in the emotional caption.",

This annual military parade is held to celebrate the king's official birthday.The event marked a significant moment for the royal family and the public, as it was Kate's return to public life following her diagnosis.Kate's appearance was a significant topic of discussion among onlookers, who chatted and warmed their hands on flasks of tea. \"We're very excited,\" Reine Geldenhuys, 41, told CNN. \"We are hoping to walk up to the balcony and see her beautiful face again... We've been missing seeing her out in public so we're here for her mostly,\" she added. The public's enthusiasm and support underscored the emotional impact of Kate's return to public life following her health challenges.Kate was seen smiling in a horse-drawn carriage alongside her three children as the procession made its way from Buckingham Palace to the Horse Guards Parade. The sight of the Princess of Wales with Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis brought a cheerful ambiance to the event.According to NBC News, Prince Louis, 6, particularly delighted the crowds by enthusiastically waving from the carriage window. This touching moment underscored the significance of Kate's return to public life, drawing warm reactions from onlookers who had missed her presence during her recent health-related absence. The family's participation in Trooping the Colour highlighted their continued dedication to royal traditions and public engagements, even amid personal challenges.The last time Kate appeared in public with the royal family was in December, attending a Christmas Day service in Sandringham. Shortly after, on January 16, the palace announced that Kate, 42, had been hospitalized for \"planned abdominal surgery\" and would be taking time off to recover from the procedure.In March, Kate publicly revealed that she had been diagnosed with cancer following the surgery, though the specific type of cancer has not been disclosed. The palace also confirmed that she began a course of preventative chemotherapy in late February. This recent appearance at Trooping the Colour marked her return to public duties after her period of recovery.In the first update on her health since announcing her diagnosis, Kate said Friday that she is \"making good progress\" as she undergoes chemotherapy but is not \"out of the woods yet.\"Despite her attendance at Trooping the Colour, Kate will not immediately resume her official duties. She will not be present at Garter Day or Royal Ascot next week but hopes to participate in a few public engagements over the summer.Later on Saturday, the entire working Royal Family will gather at Buckingham Palace for a flypast, which is considered one of the highlights of the royal calendar.This year's Trooping the Colour -- a celebration that includes over 1,400 soldiers -- marks the second for Charles as king. He too was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year, but has since returned to public duties. Buckingham Palace has not disclosed the type of cancer the 75-year-old monarch was diagnosed with, nor the specific treatment he is undergoing.",

                    "text": "Britain put on a display of birthday pageantry Saturday for King Charles III with a military parade that also marked the Princess of Wales' first public appearance since her cancer diagnosis early this year.The annual event was also a show of stability by the monarchy after months in which both the king and Kate, wife of the heir to the throne Prince William, have been sidelined by cancer treatment.The 42-year-old princess traveled in a horse-drawn carriage from Buckingham Palace down the grand avenue known as the Mall with her children George, 10, Charlotte, 9, and 6-year-old Louis. Bystanders cheered as they caught a glimpse of Kate, dressed in a white dress by designer Jenny Packham and a wide-brimmed Philip Treacy hat.Huge crowds turn out each June to watch the parade, also known as Trooping the Colour, which begins with a procession involving horses, musicians and hundreds of soldiers in ceremonial uniform from Buckingham Palace.Prince William, in military dress uniform, rode on horseback for the ceremony, in which troops in ceremonial finery parade past the king with their regimental flag, or \"colour.\"Charles, who also is being treated for an undisclosed form of cancer, traveled in a carriage with Queen Camilla, rather than on horseback as he did last year.The king inspected the troops from a dais on the parade ground, saluting as elite regiments of Foot Guards marched past.Five regiments take turns to parade their colour, and this year it was the turn of a company of the Irish Guards, which has Kate as its honorary colonel. The troops, dressed in scarlet tunics and bearskin hats, were led onto the parade ground by their mascot, an Irish wolfhound named Seamus.After the parade, members of the family went to a Buckingham Palace balcony to watch a fly-by of military aircraft — and delight the crowds below. In one of the many quirks of British royal convention, Saturday is not the king's real birthday — that's in November. Like his mother Queen Elizabeth II before him, Charles has an official birthday on the second Saturday in June. The date was chosen because the weather is generally good, though early sunshine on Saturday gave way to a blustery, rainy day in London.",

                    "text": "June 15 (UPI) -- Princess Catherine participated with other royals for the celebration of King Charles' officials birthday Saturday in her first public appearance since being diagnosed with cancer earlier this year. The 42-year-old Princess of Wales, her husband Prince William, and their three children, George, Charlotte and Louis, appeared on the balcony with the king and Queen Camilla to watch a Royal Air Force flyover. They were cheered by the spectators on a drizzling Saturday morning in London. The Royal Family posted video of the event. The princess earlier was driven in a state carriage with her children from Buckingham Palace to Horse Glades Parade for the Trooping the Colour. Then they watched the events as her husband William, the Prince of Wales, rode on horseback. In Trooping the Colour, 1,400 officers and soldiers, together with 400 musicians and 200 horses, go through the streets of London from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guard's Parade. Crowds lined the route. The event marks the official birthday of the British sovereign for more than 260 years. Charles' actual birthday is Nov. 14, when he turned 75. Kate has last appeared in public on Christmas Day, which was weeks before she revealed her cancer diagnosis. On Friday, Kate gave an update on her health, saying she had made \"good progress\" in her recovery, including chemotherapy. She said she was \"not out of the woods yet\" with several more months of treatment. \"I have been blown away by all the kind messages of support and encouragement over the last couple of months,\" she wrote. \"It really has made the world of difference to William and me and has helped us both through some of the harder times.\" Charles also has been undergoing cancer treatment since a diagnosis in February. He was allowed to resume public-facing duties in April. \"Most of us are surprised that she is here today,\" Katie Nicholl, an NBC News royal contributor, said. \"We know that as the King and the Princess of Wales have gone through this cancer journey together, they've very much been supporting each other behind the scenes. Well this is the ultimate show of support.\"",

Catherine, who wore white with navy details, was seen earlier smiling and talking to her children, who were dressed in navy and white, in their carriage before they arrived at Horse Guards Parade in Whitehall. The Princess of Wales, who is the regiment’s colonel, also wore an Irish Guards regimental brooch. They were cheered by crowds in the Mall as they left Buckingham Palace. King Charles and Queen Camilla were riding in a carriage in their royal procession ahead of the Princess of Wales. The Princess of Wales was photographed prior to that arriving at Buckingham Palace by car before the parade. Ahead of the event, Kate said in a statement: “I’m looking forward to attending the King’s birthday parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer, but equally knowing I am not out of the woods yet. “I am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty. Taking each day as it comes, listening to my body and allowing myself to take this much needed time to heal.” The Princess of Wales said she was making “good progress” but “there are good days and bad days”. “On those bad days you feel weak, tired and you have to give in to your body resting. But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well.” She added that her treatment will continue “for a few more months”. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: “His Majesty is delighted that the princess is able to attend tomorrow’s events and is much looking forward to all elements of the day.” The celebration has been held on the sovereign’s birthday for more than 260 years. At the event, Number 9 Company, Irish guards, a regiment Kate represents as colonel, will be trooping the king’s colour. In a letter read to the regiment last week, the Princess of Wales, who is undergoing chemotherapy, wrote to the Irish guards to apologise for being unable to take the salute and wished them luck. Lt Gen Sir James Bucknall will take the salute on her behalf. The king, who is also undergoing treatment for cancer, will not ride on horseback during the ceremony, but will instead review the parade from an Ascot landau carriage. He attended his first trooping at the age of three, riding in a carriage with his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. More than 1,250 soldiers and hundreds of Guardsmen assembled on the parade ground to be inspected by the king from his carriage with Camilla, who is colonel of the Grenadier Guards, and accompanied by the mounted royal colonels. The stands overlooking the parade ground were filled with about 8,000 family members and partners of the guardsmen and officers on parade.",

                    "text": "Joe Alwyn has broken his silence on the end of his relationship with Taylor Swift, over a year after their breakup. The actor sat down with The Sunday Times Style Magazine ahead of the release of his upcoming film, Yorgos Lanthimos’ Kinds of Kindness, on June 21. During the conversation, Alwyn spoke candidly about his breakup with the global superstar in April 2023. While he is the first to address their breakup publicly, Swift’s newest album, The Tortured Poets Department, seemingly addresses it, with songs like “So Long, London” and “The Black Dog.” Not to mention the name of the album itself resembles a WhatsApp group chat Alwyn has with Andrew Scott and Paul Mescal called The Tortured Man Club. When asked if he had listened to the album, Alwyn didn’t directly answer the question. Instead, he told the publication, “I would hope that anyone and everyone can empathize and understand the difficulties that come with the end of a long, loving, fully committed relationship of over six and a half years. That is a hard thing to navigate. What is unusual and abnormal in this situation is that, one week later, it’s suddenly in the public domain and the outside world is able to weigh in.” Once the news broke that the two had parted ways, the Conversations With Friends star noted that their “very real” experience was suddenly thrown into the “very unreal space” of tabloids, social media and the press, where it was “dissected, speculated on, pulled out of shape beyond recognition.” “And the truth is, to that last point, there is always going to be a gap between what is known and what is said,” he explained. “I have made my peace with that.” Swifties have long speculated that Alwyn was the one who wanted to keep their relationship private, and the actor made it a purpose to state in his interview with the U.K. publication that they decided that together, and he wanted to continue to keep the more private details to himself. “It was never something to commodify, and I see no reason to change that now,” Alwyn said, adding, “Look, this is also a little over a year ago now, and I feel fortunate to be in a really great place in my life — professionally and personally. I feel really good.” Elsewhere their conversation, the Harriet actor opened up about his experience working with Lanthimos for the second time on Kinds of Kindness, which also stars Emma Stone, a longtime friend of Swift’s and regular collaborator of the director. The film’s star-studded cast also includes Willem Dafoe, Margaret Qualley, Jesse Plemons and Hunter Schafer, among others. In the project, Alwyn plays a single father, who is trying to get his wife (Stone) back from a cult. “Even though Yorgos really goes into dark corners in his work, he keeps a light atmosphere on set. It’s the second time I’ve worked with him and with Emily,” he said, referring to Stone by her birth name, which she previously told The Hollywood Reporter she would like to go by professionally. “I love them both, and I love working with them, so it felt comfortable.” Following Alwyn and Swift’s breakup, the Grammy-winning artist began a very public relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. She made her first appearance at a Chiefs football game in September 2023 and attended 12 other games last season, including the Super Bowl, where the Chiefs won for the second year in a row.",

The “Fortnight” singer has a fresh set of international The Eras Tour stops, a new album (The Tortured Poets Department), and a Super Bowl-winning boyfriend in Travis Kelce to cuddle up with. Although Swift is quite cozy under superstardom’s bright lights, not everyone in her orbit is a fan of fame. In fact, the musician’s ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn claimed that their breakup was an “unusual and abnormal situation” given the public’s sudden interest in him. Today (June 15), during an interview with The Times, Alwyn discussed dealing with the breakup and all the attention that came with it. “I would hope that anyone and everyone can empathize and understand the difficulties that come with the end of a long, loving, fully committed relationship of over six and a half years,” he said. “That is a hard thing to navigate.” He went on to address fans’ opinions on him, the split, and more. “What is unusual and abnormal in this situation is that, one week later, it’s suddenly in the public domain,” he said. “The outside world is able to weigh in.” Ultimately, since their decision to go separate ways in April 2023, Alwyn has worked through his feelings on everything, including the unwanted notoriety. “There is always going to be a gap between what is known and what is said,” he said. “I have made my peace with that.” Users online have praised Alwyn for the way he managed the split in the media in comparison to Swift’s most recent ex-lover, The 1975’s frontman Matty Healy.",

Speaking to the Hollywood Reporter while promoting Kinds of Kindness, the Yorgos Lanthimos film he co-stars in, Alwyn was asked whether he had listened to The Tortured Poets Department, which features tracks like “So Long, London” that are seemingly inspired by their split. While Alwyn didn’t say if he had heard the LP, he did open up about the breakup. “I would hope that anyone and everyone can empathize and understand the difficulties that come with the end of a long, loving, fully committed relationship of over six and a half years,” Alwyn said. “That is a hard thing to navigate. What is unusual and abnormal in this situation is that, one week later, it’s suddenly in the public domain and the outside world is able to weigh in.” Alwyn, who reportedly long sought to protect the couple’s privacy despite the high-profile nature of their relationship, added, “It was never something to commodify, and I see no reason to change that now. Look, this is also a little over a year ago now, and I feel fortunate to be in a really great place in my life — professionally and personally. I feel really good.” During their nearly seven-year relationship, the pair were not only a couple but also musical collaborators: Alwyn cowrote (under the name William Bowery) “Exile” and “Betty” from Folklore, and “Champagne Problems,” “Coney Island,” and “Evermore” on Evermore. Alwyn also co-produced six songs from Folklore, earning him a Grammy when it won Album of the Year.",

The movie hits theaters June 21. Alwyn refrained from sharing whether or not he is dating anyone or if he remains in contact with Swift. \"I'm sure you can appreciate, given the level of noise and scrutiny about my past relationship, why I wouldn't want to just open to the door to things like that right now,\" he explained.

                    "text": "Joe Alwyn is opening up for the first time about his split from Taylor Swift. In an interview with The Sunday Times Style Magazine, published Saturday (June 15), the 33-year-old actor, who stars in Yorgos Lanthimos’ upcoming film Kinds of Kindness, broke his silence about his breakup with the pop superstar in April 2023. Alwyn, who dated Swift for six years, called their relationship “long, loving” and “fully committed.” The “Anti-Hero” singer, 34, has not yet publicly commented on the breakup, but many believe that her latest album, The Tortured Poets Department, was inspired by the split. Earlier this year, fans speculated that the title of Tortured Poets — which has spent seven weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 — resembles a group chat between Alwyn and fellow actors Andrew Scott and Paul Mescal called “The Tortured Man Club.” When asked if he’s listened to his ex-girlfriend’s new album, Alwyn told the Times, “In thinking on what I was going to say, I would think and hope that anyone and everyone can empathize. … This isn’t a direct answer to your question, but just thinking about what I want to talk about.” He continued, “I would hope that anyone and everyone can empathize and understand the difficulties that come with the end of a long, loving, fully committed relationship of over six and a half years. That is a hard thing to navigate.” Alwyn and Swift broke up in April 2023 around the time the pop star launched her record-breaking The Eras Tour in North America. The Conversations With Friends actor reflected on aftermath of the split, saying, “What is unusual and abnormal in this situation is that, one week later, it’s suddenly in the public domain and the outside world is able to weigh in.” “So you have something very real suddenly thrown into a very unreal space: tabloids, social media, press, where it is then dissected, speculated on, pulled out of shape beyond recognition,” he told the Times. “And the truth is, to that last point, there is always going to be a gap between what is known and what is said. I have made my peace with that.” Alwyn noted that he and Swift “mutually” agreed to “keep the more private details of our relationship private.” He added, “It was never something to commodify and I see no reason to change that now.” Swift and the Favourite actor first started dating in 2016, and mostly kept a low profile. During their six years together, they rarely made public outings. They did, however, speak lovingly about each other in occasional interviews, and the 14-time Grammy winner opened up about falling in love with Alwyn in her Netflix documentary, Miss Americana. Alwyn told the Times that he’s been doing well following the breakup. “Look, this is also a little over a year ago now, and I feel fortunate to be in a really great place in my life — professionally and personally. I feel really good,” he said. After ending things with Alwyn, Swift started dating Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce last summer. The athlete is another rumored Tortured Poets muse, with fans suspecting that “The Alchemy” and “So High School” were both written about him.",

                    "text": "At least they were for an interview with The Sunday Times published today, in which for the first time ever, Alwyn spoke publicly about his breakup with the billionaire singer. If the Swift song “Dress” is considered a reliable historical document, it appears the couple first met at the 2016 Met Gala. Swift was there because she’s Swift; Alwyn, an early-career actor, was reportedly there as actor Garrett Hedlund’s plus-one. Thus began a six-or-so-year-long relationship (depending on what clues you agree with) with a fairly definitive end point at or before April 2023. Swift, who was mid-Eras Tour when the breakup news broke, moved on fairly swiftly, first with the 1975’s Matty Healy (also a rumored TPD subject), then with current consort, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. While those liaisons played out on the main stage, Alwyn’s life continued out of the spotlight, with rare public appearances and the occasional cryptic social media post. Anonymous sources purportedly close to Alwyn have said that he, too, has “moved on” and is “focused on work.” And it’s that work that might force him a bit backward, if this latest interview—which, perhaps understandably, plays up his Swift connection far more prominently than his latest acting job—remains the norm. Even Alwyn gets it, telling the Times, “I understand people’s curiosity,” when asked about Swift and TPD. And of the album, itself, he says that he “would hope that anyone and everyone can empathize and understand the difficulties that come with the end of a long, loving, fully committed relationship of over six and a half years.” “That is a hard thing to navigate. What is unusual and abnormal in this situation is that, one week later, it’s suddenly in the public domain, and the outside world is able to weigh in.” Looking back on the furor around their relationship, Alwyn says, “You have something very real suddenly thrown into a very unreal space: tabloids, social media, press, where it is then dissected, speculated on, pulled out of shape beyond recognition. And the truth is, to that last point, there is always going to be a gap between what is known and what is said. I have made my peace with that.” Alwyn also suggests that fans and the media have been slower to move on than either he or Swift were. “Look, this is also a little over a year ago now, and I feel fortunate to be in a really great place in my life, professionally and personally,” he says. One thing the relationship did teach him was the need to keep his personal life under as many wraps as possible. “As everyone knows, we together — both of us, mutually — decided to keep the more private details of our relationship private. It was never something to commodity, and I see no reason to change that now,” he says. The same goes for whatever is happening in his romantic life at present, which he refuses to discuss. “I’m sure you can appreciate,” he says, “given the level of noise and scrutiny about my past relationship, why I wouldn’t want to just open the door to things like that right now.” “I have brilliant, authentic people in my life,” he says. “I try and live in reality and away from the kind of online noise of Twitter—or wherever else it comes from—and try and just stay in the moment.”",

Taylor revealed Joe had written the entire piano part, along with singing, \"I can see you standin' honey/With his arms around your body/Laughin' but the joke's not funny at all.\" She went on to say The Favourite actor was \"always just playing and making things up and kind of creating things,\" but the couple may have never worked together if it wasn't for the COVID-19 shutdown. \"I was like, 'Hey, this could be really weird, and we could hate this,'\" she explained, \"'because we're in quarantine and there's nothing else going on, could we just try to see what it's like if we write this song together?'\" The result of their professional collaboration?

                    "text": "Joe Alwyn stars in the upcoming “Kinds of Kindness,” director Yorgos Lanthimos’ tale of three movies within one. However, the actor’s Saturday interview about the upcoming film with The Sunday Times was overshadowed by long-anticipated details of his 2023 breakup from Taylor Swift. “I would hope that anyone and everyone can empathize and understand the difficulties that come with the end of a long, loving, fully committed relationship of over six and a half years,” Alwyn said while publicly addressing their split for the first time. “That is a hard thing to navigate.” He continued, “What is unusual and abnormal in this situation is that, one week later, it’s suddenly in the public domain and the outside world is able to weigh in.” As the former pair learned at the end of their relationship, “You have something very real suddenly thrown into a very unreal space: tabloids, social media, press, where it is then dissected, speculated on, pulled out of shape beyond recognition,” he noted. “There is always going to be a gap between what is known and what is said. I have made my peace with that.” Alwyn also mentioned that he doesn’t seek to gain anything from finally speaking about the relationship and its aftermath. “As everyone knows, we together — both of us, mutually — decided to keep the more private details of our relationship private. It was never something to commodify and I see no reason to change that now,” he said, despite Swifties’ speculation of his influence in her recent music. “I feel fortunate to be in a really great place in my life, professionally and personally,” he added. “I feel really good.” Regarding “Kinds of Kindness,” the actor admitted, “Anyone who can crack a Yorgos film overnight I applaud, and I’m not sure I have a fully articulated answer as to what it’s all about.” “Even though Yorgos really goes into dark corners in his work, he keeps a light atmosphere on set. It’s the second time I’ve worked with him and with Emily,” Alwyn said, referencing “The Favourite” with Emma Stone. “I love them both and I love working with them, so it felt comfortable.” “Kinds of Kindness” premieres in theaters June 21 after debuting at Cannes.",

                    "text": "JERUSALEM (AP) — An explosion in southern Gaza killed eight Israeli soldiers, the military said Saturday, making it the deadliest attack on Israeli forces in months. The attack, coming more than eight months into a grinding war that shows few signs of ending soon, was likely to fuel new calls for a cease-fire by Israeli protesters. It also came as the government confronts widespread anger over exemptions from military service for young ultra-Orthodox men. Israel launched an air and ground invasion of Gaza in response to an Oct. 7 cross-border attack by Hamas and other militants that killed some 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. The Israeli offensive has killed over 37,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not differentiate between civilians and combatants. It also has unleashed a humanitarian disaster in Gaza, where over 80% of the population has been displaced and Israeli restrictions and ongoing fighting have hindered efforts to bring in humanitarian aid, fueling widespread hunger. Saturday’s explosion took place in Rafah, a southern city that Israel has identified as Hamas’ last major stronghold. It sent in ground troops to the city in early May and has given no indication when the operation will end. “They knew they might have to sacrifice their lives, but they did it so we could live in this country. I salute them and hug their families,” said Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz in a post on X, formerly Twitter. The military said the explosion happened just after 5 a.m. in the Tal al-Sultan area of Rafah. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, said it was caused either by an explosive placed by Hamas or by an anti-tank missile. “We need to defeat the Rafah Brigade of Hamas and we are doing this with determination,” he said. In January, 21 Israeli troops were killed in a single attack by Palestinian militants in Gaza. President Joe Biden earlier this month unveiled a new cease-fire proposal that seeks the release of the roughly 120 hostages who remain in Gaza and an end to the fighting. While the international community has broadly embraced the plan, both Israel and Hamas have expressed misgivings. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he will not halt the war until he achieves the twin goals of destroying Hamas’ military and governing capabilities. “Today we paid another heartbreaking price in our just war for the defense of the homeland,” Netanyahu said Saturday. “With deep sorrow, in heavy mourning, I bow my head together with all the citizens of Israel and mourn the fall of our heroic warriors.” The inconclusive war has divided the Israeli public, with tens of thousands of people taking to the streets each Saturday night to call on the government to reach a deal that would bring the hostages home. The Israeli government has already pronounced over 40 of the hostages held by Hamas to be dead, and officials fear that number could grow the longer they remain in captivity. At a rally Saturday evening, participants watched a video message from Andrey Kozlov, who was rescued from Hamas captivity a week ago. “More than 120 hostages are still there, and I can’t feel all the happiness from this situation because I was rescued and they were not,” he said, according to The Hostages Families Forum Headquarters. “I ask to bring them home as soon as possible. Israel, world, Hamas, I ask you to make a deal as soon as possible.” The deadly explosion also comes days after Netanyahu’s coalition voted in favor of extending the controversial exemptions from the military draft given to ultra-Orthodox men. Although the vote was only procedural, it caused an uproar at a time when Israel continues to fight Hamas militants in Gaza and Hezbollah militants along the country’s northern border with Lebanon and the death toll continues to climb. Over 600 soldiers have been killed in fighting since Oct. 7, according to the military. Last month, Israel’s Supreme Court ordered an end to government subsidies for ultra-Orthodox men who don’t serve in the army. But Netanyahu’s government, which includes politically powerful ultra-Orthodox parties, has found ways to keep money flowing to religious institutions. The government is still under orders to pass a new draft law. Most Jewish men and women are required to serve in the military from the age of 18. The exemptions granted to religious men have long been a source of contention among the broader public. Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, was the only member of Netanyahu’s coalition to vote against this week’s legislation. Gallant, a member of the country’s War Cabinet, has insisted that all sectors of Israeli society contribute equally during its war against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. If Netanyahu’s ultra-Orthodox partners leave the government, the country would be forced into new elections at a time when Netanyahu’s popularity is low and his re-election prospects are questionable. Months of cease-fire negotiations have failed to find common ground between Israeli and Hamas. On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Hamas proposed changes to a U.S.-backed plan, some of which he said were “workable” and some not. Hamas has continually called for a permanent cease-fire and complete Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza as part of any deal that would see the hostages released. While the proposal announced by U.S. President Joe Biden includes these two provisions, Hamas has expressed concern about whether Israel will commit to them. Meanwhile, violence has flared in the West Bank since the Israel-Hamas war erupted. On Saturday, a 16-year-old Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli forces near the northern city of Nablus, the Ramallah-based Health Ministry said.

                    "text": "JERUSALEM — Israel’s military said Saturday that eight soldiers were killed in southern Gaza in the deadliest attack on Israeli forces in months. The troops were killed in an explosion, the army said, without elaborating. The deaths will likely fuel calls for a cease-fire and heighten Israeli public anger over ultra-Orthodox exemptions from the military. In January, 21 Israeli troops were killed in a single attack by Palestinian militants in Gaza. Last month, Israel’s Supreme Court ordered an end to government subsidies for many ultra-Orthodox men who don’t serve in the army. A new draft law hasn’t been passed, but the coalition of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week voted in favor of extending exemptions for religious men. Although the vote was only procedural, it caused an uproar by being approved during a war in which hundreds of soldiers have died and many others remain inside Gaza or on the front lines against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. Yoav Gallant, Israel’s Defense Minister and member of the country’s War Cabinet, has insisted that all sectors of Israeli society should contribute equally during its war against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. Israel’s coalition government contains a powerful bloc of ultra-Orthodox parties that have been longtime partners of Netanyahu. If these parties leave the government, the country would be forced into new elections, with Netanyahu trailing significantly in the polls amid the war. In Tel Aviv, anti-government protests have been ongoing for months, with many demonstrators calling for the immediate return of the hostages, along with Netanyahu’s resignation. Israel’s bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 37,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, who don’t give the breakdown of civilians and fighters. The war has also driven about 80% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes, and Israeli restrictions and ongoing fighting have hindered efforts to bring in humanitarian aid, fueling widespread hunger. Israel launched its campaign after Hamas and other militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage. More than 100 hostages were released during a weeklong cease-fire last year in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Hamas is believed to be holding around 80 hostages and the remains of another 40. Months of cease-fire negotiations have failed to find common ground between Israeli and Hamas. On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Hamas proposed changes to a U.S.-backed plan, some of which he said were “workable” and some not. Hamas has continually called for a permanent cease-fire and complete Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza as part of any deal that would see the hostages released. While the proposal announced by U.S. President Joe Biden includes these two provisions, Hamas has expressed concern about whether Israel will commit to them. Violence has flared in the West Bank since the Israel-Hamas war erupted. On Saturday, a 16-year-old Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli forces near the northern city of Nablus, the Ramallah-based Health Ministry said. The Israeli army didn’t immediately respond to request for comment about the shooting.",

                    "text": "JERUSALEM >> Eight Israeli soldiers were killed while riding in an armored vehicle in the southern Gaza Strip today, the Israeli military said, as the country’s offensive in the southern city of Rafah continued to exact a toll among its troops. The deaths occurred around 5:15 a.m. local time as Israeli troops operated in the northwest part of Tel al-Sultan, a neighborhood in western Rafah, the Israeli military said. The eight soldiers, who belonged to the military’s engineering corps, were riding in an armored vehicle when the blast occurred, the military said. Hamas, the Palestinian armed group, said in a statement that its militants had fired anti-tank missiles at Israeli military vehicles in western Rafah, killing some soldiers. It was not immediately clear whether it was an explosive device that damaged the vehicle or anti-tank missile fire, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesperson, told reporters. The explosion damaged the vehicle but might have also ignited munitions inside, Israeli military officials said, adding that the blast was severe enough to make finding and identifying the bodies difficult. Israel has fought for more than eight months in Gaza in the wake of the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, which killed roughly 1,200 in Israel — mostly civilians — and took about 250 others hostage. More than 36,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the war, according to Palestinian health officials, who do not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Hamas has fought a dogged guerrilla war, resisting Israel’s efforts to decisively defeat the organization, take down its leaders and bring back many of those abducted during the surprise Oct. 7 attack. According to the Israeli military, the campaign has killed an estimated 13,000 to 14,000 militants in Gaza. Israeli officials have not provided evidence for the calculation. More than 300 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the Israeli ground invasion of Gaza began in late October. At the end of January, about 20 Israeli soldiers were killed as they prepared to demolish buildings inside Gaza near the border with Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly mourned the soldiers’ deaths and called for Israel to remain committed to its military’s goals of destroying Hamas, bringing home the hostages and “ensuring Gaza can no longer threaten Israel.” “There is no substitute for victory,” Netanyahu said, adding, “Do not let anyone distract you from the simple and clear fact: We must remain dedicated to the war aims, despite the heavy and agonizing price.” Netanyahu has been criticized by parts of the Israeli public, the families of hostages held in Gaza and former security officials. Some argue that only a settlement with Hamas will return the remaining 120 living and dead captives; others have argued that his failure to articulate a clear postwar alternative to Hamas has left the country trapped in a holding pattern in Gaza. Israeli forces rescued four hostages in a rescue operation in central Gaza last weekend that also left scores of Palestinians dead, according to local health officials. Hagari applauded the mission but added, “We must be honest — we cannot bring home everyone in this manner.” Israeli forces have closed in on Rafah in recent weeks, sweeping along the border area with Egypt in an effort to destroy tunnels they say Hamas has used to smuggle weapons into Gaza. They have also conducted raids into the city itself. The United Nations estimates than more than 1 million Palestinians have fled Rafah. In the northern town of Beit Jann — populated by Arab Israelis who adhere to the Druze faith — residents mourned Waseem Mahmoud, one of the fallen soldiers. The Druze occupy an unusual middle ground in Israel: Arab practitioners of a minority religion who generally serve in Israel’s military and security forces. The town’s residents had planned to observe Eid al-Adha, a holiday shared by both Muslims and Druze. But all of the public festivities were called off in light of the news, said Nazih Dabour, the town mayor. “We can’t bury our children and celebrate on the same day,” said Dabour, who paid the family a condolence call today. “It’s a huge tragedy for us.” ——— This article originally appeared in The New York Times.",

                    "text": "JERUSALEM — An explosion in southern Gaza killed eight Israeli soldiers, the military said Saturday, making it the deadliest attack on Israeli forces in months. The attack, coming more than eight months into a grinding war that shows few signs of ending soon, was likely to fuel new calls for a cease-fire by Israeli protesters. It also came as the government confronts widespread anger over exemptions from military service for young ultra-Orthodox men. Israel launched an air and ground invasion of Gaza in response to an Oct. 7 cross-border attack by Hamas and other militants that killed some 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. The Israeli offensive has killed over 37,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not differentiate between civilians and combatants. It also has unleashed a humanitarian disaster in Gaza, where over 80% of the population has been displaced and Israeli restrictions and ongoing fighting have hindered efforts to bring in humanitarian aid, fueling widespread hunger. Saturday’s explosion took place in Rafah, a southern city that Israel has identified as Hamas’ last major stronghold. It sent in ground troops to the city in early May and has given no indication when the operation will end. “They knew they might have to sacrifice their lives, but they did it so we could live in this country. I salute them and hug their families,” said Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz in a post on X, formerly Twitter. The military said the explosion happened just after 5 a.m. in the Tal al-Sultan area of Rafah. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, said it was caused either by an explosive placed by Hamas or by an anti-tank missile. “We need to defeat the Rafah Brigade of Hamas and we are doing this with determination,” he said. In January, 21 Israeli troops were killed in a single attack by Palestinian militants in Gaza. President Biden earlier this month unveiled a new cease-fire proposal that seeks the release of the roughly 120 hostages who remain in Gaza and an end to the fighting. While the international community has broadly embraced the plan, both Israel and Hamas have expressed misgivings. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he will not halt the war until he achieves the twin goals of destroying Hamas’ military and governing capabilities. “Today we paid another heartbreaking price in our just war for the defense of the homeland,” Netanyahu said Saturday. “With deep sorrow, in heavy mourning, I bow my head together with all the citizens of Israel and mourn the fall of our heroic warriors.” The inconclusive war has divided the Israeli public, with tens of thousands of people taking to the streets each Saturday night to call on the government to reach a deal that would bring the hostages home. The Israeli government has already pronounced over 40 of the hostages held by Hamas to be dead, and officials fear that number could grow the longer they remain in captivity. At a rally Saturday evening, participants watched a video message from Andrey Kozlov, who was rescued from Hamas captivity a week ago. “More than 120 hostages are still there, and I can’t feel all the happiness from this situation because I was rescued and they were not,” he said, according to The Hostages Families Forum Headquarters. “I ask to bring them home as soon as possible. Israel, world, Hamas, I ask you to make a deal as soon as possible.” Speaking at the weekly gathering of relatives of hostages in Tel Aviv, Rotem Kalderon, son of hostage Ofer Kalderon, said he isn’t ready “to live in a world full of death.” “I am not ready to live in a country with a government that sends us to settle in the borders and fight in wars and in the end abandons us,” he said. “I’m not ready to live without a father.” The deadly explosion also comes days after Netanyahu’s coalition voted in favor of extending the controversial exemptions from the military draft given to ultra-Orthodox men. Although the vote was only procedural, it caused an uproar at a time when Israel continues to fight Hamas militants in Gaza and Hezbollah militants along the country’s northern border with Lebanon and the death toll continues to climb. Over 600 soldiers have been killed in fighting since Oct. 7, according to the military. Last month, Israel’s Supreme Court ordered an end to government subsidies for ultra-Orthodox men who don’t serve in the army. But Netanyahu’s government, which includes politically powerful ultra-Orthodox parties, has found ways to keep money flowing to religious institutions. The government is still under orders to pass a new draft law. Most Jewish men and women are required to serve in the military from the age of 18. The exemptions granted to religious men have long been a source of contention among the broader public. Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, was the only member of Netanyahu’s coalition to vote against this week’s legislation. Gallant, a member of the country’s War Cabinet, has insisted that all sectors of Israeli society contribute equally during its war against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. If Netanyahu’s ultra-Orthodox partners leave the government, the country would be forced into new elections at a time when Netanyahu’s popularity is low and his re-election prospects are questionable. At an anti-government demonstration Saturday, thousands of people demanded new elections and the release of the hostages. “The fact that eight soldiers got killed today just emphasizes the fact that we need a change,” said Amir Schnabel, one of the demonstrators. “We can’t live this reality for a long time. If today eight soldiers were killed, more will get killed the next day and the day after. And the only way to make a change is just to protest and bring the government down, and we have to do it as soon as possible. ” Months of cease-fire negotiations have failed to find common ground between Israeli and Hamas. On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Hamas proposed changes to a U.S.-backed plan, some of which he said were “workable” and some not. Hamas has continually called for a permanent cease-fire and complete Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza as part of any deal that would see the hostages released. While the proposal announced by U.S. President Joe Biden includes these two provisions, Hamas has expressed concern about whether Israel will commit to them. Meanwhile, violence has flared in the West Bank since the Israel-Hamas war erupted. On Saturday, a 16-year-old Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli forces near the northern city of Nablus, the Ramallah-based Health Ministry said. An Israeli security official confirmed Israeli forces opened fire at Palestinians who were throwing rocks at troops during a counterterrorism operation in the area. He spoke on condition of anonymity, pending a formal announcement by the army. Comments are not available on this story. « Previous Next",

At a rally Saturday evening, participants watched a video message from Andrey Kozlov, who was rescued from Hamas captivity a week ago. “More than 120 hostages are still there, and I can’t feel all the happiness from this situation because I was rescued and they were not,” he said, according to The Hostages Families Forum Headquarters. “I ask to bring them home as soon as possible. Israel, world, Hamas, I ask you to make a deal as soon as possible.” Speaking at the weekly gathering of relatives of hostages in Tel Aviv, Rotem Kalderon, son of hostage Ofer Kalderon, said he isn’t ready “to live in a world full of death.” “I am not ready to live in a country with a government that sends us to settle in the borders and fight in wars and in the end abandons us,” he said. “I’m not ready to live without a father.” The deadly explosion also comes days after Netanyahu’s coalition voted in favor of extending the controversial exemptions from the military draft given to ultra-Orthodox men. Although the vote was only procedural, it caused an uproar at a time when Israel continues to fight Hamas militants in Gaza and Hezbollah militants along the country’s northern border with Lebanon and the death toll continues to climb. Over 600 soldiers have been killed in fighting since Oct. 7, according to the military. Last month, Israel’s Supreme Court ordered an end to government subsidies for ultra-Orthodox men who don’t serve in the army. But Netanyahu’s government, which includes politically powerful ultra-Orthodox parties, has found ways to keep money flowing to religious institutions. The government is still under orders to pass a new draft law. Most Jewish men and women are required to serve in the military from the age of 18. The exemptions granted to religious men have long been a source of contention among the broader public. Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, was the only member of Netanyahu’s coalition to vote against this week’s legislation. Gallant, a member of the country’s War Cabinet, has insisted that all sectors of Israeli society contribute equally during its war against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. If Netanyahu’s ultra-Orthodox partners leave the government, the country would be forced into new elections at a time when Netanyahu’s popularity is low and his re-election prospects are questionable. At an anti-government demonstration Saturday, thousands of people demanded new elections and the release of the hostages. “The fact that eight soldiers got killed today just emphasizes the fact that we need a change,” said Amir Schnabel, one of the demonstrators. “We can’t live this reality for a long time. If today eight soldiers were killed, more will get killed the next day and the day after. And the only way to make a change is just to protest and bring the government down, and we have to do it as soon as possible. ” Months of cease-fire negotiations have failed to find common ground between Israeli and Hamas. On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Hamas proposed changes to a U.S.-backed plan, some of which he said were “workable” and some not. Hamas has continually called for a permanent cease-fire and complete Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza as part of any deal that would see the hostages released. While the proposal announced by U.S. President Joe Biden includes these two provisions, Hamas has expressed concern about whether Israel will commit to them. Meanwhile, violence has flared in the West Bank since the Israel-Hamas war erupted. On Saturday, a 16-year-old Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli forces near the northern city of Nablus, the Ramallah-based Health Ministry said. An Israeli security official confirmed Israeli forces opened fire at Palestinians who were throwing rocks at troops during a counterterrorism operation in the area. He spoke on condition of anonymity, pending a formal announcement by the army.",

                    "text": "An explosion in southern Gaza killed eight Israeli soldiers, the military said Saturday, in the deadliest attack on the country's forces in months. The attack, coming more than eight months into a grinding war, is likely to fuel new calls from Israeli protesters for a cease-fire. It came as the government confronts widespread anger over exemptions from military service for young ultra-Orthodox men. Israel launched an air and ground invasion of Gaza in response to an Oct. 7 cross-border attack by Hamas and other militants that killed some 1,200; 250 were taken hostage. Israeli airstrikes and ground attacks have killed more than 37,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not differentiate between civilians and combatants. Saturday’s explosion took place in Rafah, a southern city that Israel has identified as Hamas’ last major stronghold. Israel sent ground troops to the city in early May and has given no indication of when the operation will end. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz paid tribute to the eight soldiers who died. “They knew they might have to sacrifice their lives, but they did it so we could live in this country. I salute them and hug their families,” Katz wrote in a post on X. The military said the explosion occurred just after 5 a.m. in the Tal al Sultan area of Rafah. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, said it was caused either by an explosive placed by Hamas or by an anti-tank missile. In January, 21 Israeli troops were killed in a single attack by Palestinian militants in Gaza. President Biden this month unveiled a cease-fire proposal that seeks the release of the roughly 120 hostages who remain in Gaza and an end to the fighting. While the international community has broadly embraced the plan, both Israel and Hamas have expressed misgivings.

The Israeli offensive has killed over 37,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not differentiate between civilians and combatants. It also has unleashed a humanitarian disaster in Gaza, where over 80% of the population has been displaced and Israeli restrictions and ongoing fighting have hindered efforts to bring in humanitarian aid, fueling widespread hunger. Saturday’s explosion took place in Rafah, a southern city that Israel has identified as Hamas’ last major stronghold. It sent in ground troops to the city in early May and has given no indication when the operation will end. “They knew they might have to sacrifice their lives, but they did it so we could live in this country.

Credit: WWE.com Sami Zayn defeated Chad Gable at WWE Clash at the Castle in a heated match. Zayn was able to win the match with a Helluva Kick after Otis defiantly carried an injured Maxxine Dupri out of the OVO Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF Hydro Arena. A hot crowd in Scotland was fully behind Sami Zayn, chanting for the popular babyface while calling Chad Gable a “w**ker.” Fans also chanted for Otis as they begged for him to do the right thing and betra his “Master” Chad Gable. Sami Zayn and Chad Gable arguably had the best feud heading into the five-match WWE Clash at the Castle show. With Gable’s contract reportedly coming due, WWE finally gave the talented star the push he has deserved for years now. Following a red-hot run alongside Jason Jordan as American Alpha in NXT iShares Exponential Technologies ETF , Gable toiled aimlessly on the main roster. Gable’s lowest moment came when he was made to portray “Shorty G” in 2019 at Vince McMahon’s behest. From there, Gable formed the Alpha Academy, which was essentially the modern-day version of the Social Outcasts. But after Gable offered counsel to Sami Zayn ahead of Sami’s record-breaking win over GUNTHER, Gable was allowed to layer his character, turn heel and all of a sudden he finds himself as one of the top heels on the Raw roster. Otis was at the center of Sami and Chad’s feud, as the precocious Superstar finds himself conflicted between listening to his abusive coach and taking Sami Zayn’s advice by branching out on his own. Gable is taking no prisoners, as Alpha Academy members Maxxine Dupri, Akira Tozawa and Otis have been held against their will in what is now a cult-like stable. MORE FOR YOU Apple’s New iPhone Function When Your Battery Dies Beats Samsung And Google Paraiso Miami Swim Week Makes Waves WWE SmackDown Results Winners And Grades From Glasgow Scotland What made Gable vs. Zayn especially delectable is the uncertainty of who would win. Was Otis going to finally stand up for himself and cost Gable the Intercontinental Championship? Was Otis going to accidentally cost Sami the match in a fit of rage, leading to a tension between Zayn and Otis? And at what point will the Creed Brothers get involved as WWE continues to tease Gable recruiting the blue-chip athletes? In the end, Chad Gable has momentum to give away, even though he did not leave Scotland with the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Everything that Chad Gable has been as a heel, Otis has been the antithesis as a sympathetic babyface. And as Otis chats his path toward revenge against Gable, there’s a good chance this could ultimately end in not only Chad Gable’s first singles title win, but also a star-making Intercontinental Championship win for Otis.

(Credit: WWE/Getty Images) Getty Images Sami Zayn defeated Chad Gable at WWE Clash at the Castle 2024 to retain the Intercontinental Championship—finally. Yes, Gable lost—again. For much of the past year, Gable had relentlessly pursued his first singles title but ultimately fell short on numerous occasions to stars like Zayn and Gunther while working as a babyface. That, of course, resulted in Gable turning on Zayn and cementing himself as a full-fledged heel in the process. At the time, Gable had a lot of momentum as a babyface, so a move to the dark side felt like a misguided move. In hindsight, however, it worked out wonderfully for Gable, who is thriving as one of the top villains on Raw. Then came another major loss to Zayn, this time at Clash at the Castle in Glasgow, Scotland. ForbesWWE Clash At The Castle 2024 Results: Bianca Belair And Jade Cargill Lose In Shocking UpsetBy Blake Oestriecher Just a few weeks ago, Becky Lynch lost the Women’s World Championship to Liv Morgan at King and Queen of the Ring in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Lynch is now officially a free agent and is expected to take a lengthy leave of absence from pro wrestling as a whole. Lynch’s situation is just the latest of many WWE contract negotiation conundrums, with marquee stars like Damian Priest and Drew McIntyre only inking new deals at the very last minute. Gable followed suit, recently confirmed that he signed a new deal and will be sticking with WWE for the long haul.

McIntyre was rewarded for his incredible work as a babyface-turned-heel over the past several years with a lucrative contract and a safe spot at the top of the card. Gable, meanwhile, looked prime to cash in with the biggest push of his singles career and a long overdue Intercontinental title win. Instead, Gable lost to Zayn yet again, which has been a running theme for the former Olympian in 2024. For a star who’s twice been voted as pro wrestling’s “most underrated” star and has been labeled as such by his peers as well, Gable’s win has been a long time coming. But it appears that he will have to wait a little longer—if it happens, at all. Fans have been craving Gable’s first championship win since 2023, when he began his quest to dethrone Gunther. That didn’t happen, and at Clash at the Castle, he failed again as he lost to the man who dethroned Gunther, instead. Maybe this was the latest long-term booking development in WWE, which has become perhaps the biggest pro of Triple H’s creative process. Stories are allowed to play out over significant stretches of time, giving them room to breathe and giving fans a reason to be invested in their outcomes. But the immediate reaction to Gable’s loss is that it doesn’t make sense from a creative perspective. He’s failed to win the Intercontinental title over and over again. Why, in-storyline, should he get another chance? Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Blake Oestriecher Following Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions",

                    "text": "Sami Zayn beat Chad Gable at Clash at the Castle on Saturday to retain the Intercontinental Championship. During the latter stages of the match, Gable accidentally clipped Maxxine Dupri in the knee outside the ring, and rather than helping Gable win the title, Otis carried Maxxine backstage to receive medical attention. That infuriated Gable and distracted him enough for Zayn to hit him with a Helluva Kick to win the match. Over the past couple of months, Zayn and Gable have gone from friends to bitter enemies, and it all led up to a one-on-one battle in Scotland. Zayn became the No. 1 contender for the Intercontinental Championship prior to WrestleMania 40, and while he had doubts about his ability to beat Gunther for the title, Gable motivated him and coached him up. Gable's efforts were rewarded, as Zayn beat Gunther at WrestleMania to end his record IC title run at 666 days. To show his appreciation, Zayn granted Gable a title match a couple of weeks later. Zayn was victorious in his hometown of Montreal, but as he was hugging his wife in celebration, Gable hit him with a German suplex and viciously attacked him. Gable's entire attitude changed from that point forward, as he went from a beloved babyface to a dastardly heel who often took out his frustrations on his Alpha Academy pupils. The former United States Olympian got another shot at the IC title and King and Queen of the Ring in a Triple Threat match against Zayn and Bronson Reed. Gable tried to get Otis to help him by taking out Zayn, but when he accidentally clotheslined Gable, it allowed Zayn to pin Reed for the win. A furious Gable verbally eviscerated Otis, Akira Tozawa and Maxxine on the ensuing episode of Raw, and he was about to whip Otis with a belt until Dupri and Zayn intervened. One week later, Zayn attempted to convince Otis to turn his back on Gable's oppression, but when Gable hit Zayn into the apron and caused Dupri and Tozawa to fall, Otis slammed Zayn instead. While apprehensive, Gable seemingly still had Otis in his back pocket entering Clash at the Castle, which put Zayn's title reign in jeopardy. Zayn managed to retain his title once again, however, perhaps bringing an end to his rivalry with Gable. Listen to Ring Rust Radio for all of the hot wrestling topics.

                    "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Bayley has held the WWE Women's title since WrestleMania 40 in April. (Credit: WWE/Getty Images) Getty Images Piper Niven received a hero’s welcome at WWE Clash at the Castle 2024, but it was Bayley who left Glasgow still the WWE Women’s Champion. Although Niven entered her first pay-per-view title match as the on-screen villain, the Scottish superstar had the crowd in the palm of her hand the moment she entered the OVO Hydro arena. Yet, much like Zelina Vega in 2023, the hometown hero fell just short in her quest to become champion when Bayley hit a crucifix driver to finish off Niven and cap off a great back-and-forth match. The outcome was, of course, not much of a surprise. Bayley is a far bigger star while Niven likely wouldn’t have been pushed to the world title scene had the circumstances surrounding Clash at the Castle been different. The reality is that WWE already has a long-term plan in place for Bayley: a SummerSlam match against Nia Jax. ForbesWWE Clash At The Castle 2024 Results: Sami Zayn Defeats Chad Gable AgainBy Blake Oestriecher It was just last month that Jax won the second-ever Queen of the Ring tournament at WWE’s King and Queen of the Ring event in Saudi Arabia. With that victory, Jax secured a SummerSlam world title shot against her respective brand’s champion. Though a clash between two heavy hitters in Jax and Niven could be intriguing, Bayley has a huge supporter in Triple H, who has consistently sung her praises and spent the past year reestablishing her as a top babyface after five years as a heel. Despite that, Bayley’s WWE Women’s Championship reign hasn’t exactly clicked on all cylinders. One of the most decorated stars in WWE history, Bayley has played second fiddle to stars like Bianca Belair and Jade Cargill on SmackDown, even though she should positioned as the No. 1 cornerstone of the blue brand’s women’s division. MORE FOR YOU Paraiso Miami Swim Week Makes Waves Apple s New iPhone Function When Your Battery Dies Beats Samsung And Google Robert Plant And Alison Krauss Offer Up Magical Evening On Stage Outside Chicago Bayley’s victory over Niven, though expected, was less about continuing her push as a beloved WWE fan favorite and more about building toward Jax’s coronation. Since being rehired in 2023 following her release in 2021, Jax has been portrayed well as a loathed—and unstoppable—heel, even picking up a rare clean victory over Belair in the Queen of the Ring tournament. With Triple H now at the helm of WWE’s creative process, the QOTR tournament is clearly going to be utilized as a stepping stone to propel rising stars even higher up the card. That’s evidenced by the fact that he ensured that the QOTR tournament would mean something when he announced that the winner would get a SummerSlam world title match. Triple H’s long-term booking is typically very strong, and Jax’s coronation was only the first major step in a monstrous push for the gargantuan superstar. With Bayley having just a passable reign as SmackDown’s champion, that only will add to the speculation that she’s simply keeping the title warm for Jax. While Bayley may be celebrating a title victory tonight in Glasgow, SummerSlam should prove to be the make-or-break point for her underwhelming championship reign. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Bayley thwarted multiple attempts at interference by Chelsea Green throughout the match and managed to take down Niven with a pinning combination out of a crucifix bomb. At WrestleMania 40, Bayley returned to the top of the women's division by defeating former Damage CTRL stablemate Iyo Sky for the WWE women's title, but it quickly made her a marked Superstar on SmackDown. Bayley entered into a friendly rivalry with Naomi, as well as a more heated one with Tiffany Stratton, beating both of them in a Triple Threat at Backlash. Shortly thereafter, Niven and Green felt slighted by Bayley when the champ expressed excitement over seeing Jade Cargill in the Queen of the Ring tournament. Cargill faced and defeated Niven in the tournament, which added further insult to injury and prompted Niven and Green to focus their energy on taking down Bayley. Bayley beat Green in a singles match on the May 24 episode of SmackDown in Saudi Arabia, but Niven and Green got one over on Bayley the following week when they beat Bayley and Naomi in a tag team match. With that win, Niven was named No. 1 contender for the Women's Championship, and her match against Bayley became official at Clash at the Castle in Piper's home country of Scotland. When Bayley confronted Nia Jax during her celebration for winning the Queen of the Ring tournament, Niven attacked Bayley, putting her and her title reign on notice. Jax's Queen of the Ring win meant she secured a Women's Championship match at SummerSlam in August, so it would have been easy for Bayley to look past Niven. Even so, Bayley was able to focus on the task at hand by vanquishing Piper to keep her title match against Nia alive for SummerSlam. Listen to Ring Rust Radio for all of the hot wrestling topics.

Credit: WWE.com Drew McIntyre lost to Damian Priest in his home country of Scotland at WWE Clash at the Castle. The finish came after a ref bump, when Drew McIntyre seemed to have the match won. Finally, a referee ran down to make the count. The referee turned out to be CM Punk. After a CM Punk kick to the groin of Drew McIntyre, Damian Priest won the match with the South of Heaven. Following Priest’s win, a hot WWE Clash at the Castle show went off the air on a very sour note. Drew McIntyre and Damian Priest’s world title match was made especially intriguing as there was legitimate doubt as to whom would win. On on hand, it’s unfathomable to think that McIntyre would lose a second world title match in the UK after losing to Roman Reigns at Clash at the Castle in Cardiff, Wales. On the other hand, McIntyre’s long-term rivalry with CM Punk ramped up this past week as McIntyre defaulted back to trolling his foe. Punk was reportedly in Scotland, suggesting he could possibly cost McIntyre the World Championship. Judgment Day was banned from ringside for this World Title Match, but CM Punk wasn’t. Damian Priest won the WWE World Championship from Drew McIntyre at WrestleMania 40, Night 2, after cashing in his Money in the Bank briefcase with help from CM Punk. With just over two months as world champion, Priest’s first world title reign will be a short one should he lose tonight, but is it worth having Drew lose in his home country? WWE ‘s long-term storytelling is apparent in the w`orld title picture on Raw. In addition to McIntyre vs. Priest at Clash at the Castle, the winner of this match will face the nearly unstoppable GUNTHER at SummerSlam. Depending on when The Judgment Day officially breaks up, this is shaping up to be yet another Heel vs. Heel matchup. Furthermore, CM Punk’s torn triceps continues to heel, and after his Royal Rumble injury, Punk is getting closer and closer to an in-ring return. One that would inevitably involve Punk’s long-awaited matchup against Drew McIntyre.

(Credit: Getty Images) Getty Images WWE Clash at the Castle 2024 was a chance at a redo-for Drew McIntyre, and the Scottish Superstar almost delivered—until CM Punk showed up and cost him his shot at the World Heavyweight Championship. If McIntyre having a chance to win a world title at Clash at the Castle sounds familiar, that’s because it should. In September 2022, McIntyre challenged then-Universal Champion Roman Reigns at the event in Cardiff, Wales, and until Reigns eventually lost that title to Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 40 after an historic 1,300-day reign, McIntyre was clearly the biggest threat to end Reigns’ dominant reign. Of course, that didn't happen. There was a chance for things to come full circle at the second-ever Clash at the Castle event, this time held in McIntyre’s home country of Scotland. But Punk, McIntyre’s longtime rival, returned after the referee was taken out and hit McIntyre with a low blow, allowing Priest to hit a South of Heaven and retain his title. Once again, McIntyre fell short in his quest to win a world title at a major WWE international event. Only, this time his loss was booked in order to further a red hot feud with Punk. ForbesWWE Clash At The Castle 2024 Results: Bayley Defeats Piper NivenBy Blake Oestriecher McIntyre, with the Glasgow crowd firmly behind him—had Priest pinned for at least 10 seconds, but a hurt referee couldn’t count the pin. So, that poetic justice McIntyre was seeking? It will have to wait. Remember, it was just in April that McIntyre, who had defeated Seth Rollins to win that very same world title, lost his championship via a cash-in by none other than Priest. MORE FOR YOU Paraiso Miami Swim Week Makes Waves Apple s New iPhone Function When Your Battery Dies Beats Samsung And Google Robert Plant And Alison Krauss Offer Up Magical Evening On Stage Outside Chicago In the weeks since then, McIntyre and Priest have been embroiled in a bitter rivalry, one that has accompanied McIntyre’s intense feud with Punk. The bigger feud of the two was undoubtedly Punk vs. McIntyre, making the most obvious finish at Clast at the Castle the one that happened: Punk shafting McIntyre out of a world title again. McIntyre has been on an absolute roll as a heel who believes he’s a hero, and at Clash at the Castle, it really was a must-win scenario for the former world champion, who has been intent on winning Raw’s world title for the better part of a year. But with McIntyre's feud with Punk clearly taking top priority, McIntyre’s world title pursuit will have it. Given that McIntyre just re-signed with WWE after months upon months of back-and-forth negotiations that called his future with the company into question, he’s likely got a firm spot in the main event scene. After all, McIntyre’s consistently incredibly performances over the past year really raised his stock, and now, he’s settled in nicely as arguably the top star on Raw. A loss arguably has temporarily derailed McIntyre’s momentum, but the follow-up is key. If McIntyre lost at Clash at the Castle just to lose to Punk, it will be difficult for McIntyre to win the World Heavyweight title anytime soon. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

During the latter stages of the match, McIntyre hit Priest with a Claymore Kick while the referee was incapacitated. Another referee seemingly ran down to make the count, but it was actually CM Punk. Punk, who has been in the midst of a heated feud with McIntyre, hit Drew with a low blow, allowing Priest to execute the South of Heaven chokeslam for the win in McIntyre's home country of Scotland. The foundation for Saturday's bout was laid at WrestleMania 40 when McIntyre faced Seth Rollins for the world heavyweight title in the opening match of Night 1. McIntyre was victorious, making him a three-time world champion in WWE, but his time as the titleholder was short-lived due to his rivalry with Punk. Since Punk was unable to compete at WrestleMania after suffering a torn triceps in the Royal Rumble match, he was on commentary for McIntyre vs. Rollins. Following his win, McIntyre taunted Punk, leading Punk to attack The Scottish Warrior despite his injury. That prompted Priest to run down the ramp with his Money in the Bank contract in tow, and he successfully cashed it in on McIntyre to win his first world championship in WWE. Coming out of WrestleMania, McIntyre was largely preoccupied by his hatred of Punk, as their rivalry continued to reach new heights despite the fact that Punk wasn't medically cleared to wrestle. Meanwhile, Priest entered into a brief program with Jey Uso, who won a multi-man match to become No. 1 contender for the world title due in part to Punk screwing McIntyre over again. In his first major title defense, Priest beat Uso at Backlash. At around that same time, McIntyre called for Priest to give him a title shot, and after the Judgment Day member agreed, their match was made official for Clash at the Castle. It was the ideal setting for McIntyre since Clash at the Castle took place in his home country of Scotland. Also, two years ago, McIntyre challenged Roman Reigns for the WWE Championship at the first Clash at the Castle in Wales. Many expected McIntyre to prevail, but interference from Solo Sikoa allowed Reigns to win. While Clash at the Castle represented the perfect opportunity for McIntyre to make up for the many misfortunes he experienced in recent years, he was once again on the wrong end of a title match, as Priest retained.

                    "text": "The Unholy Union's Alba Fyre and Isla Dawn struck gold Saturday, becoming the new women's tag team champions by defeating the team of Jade Cargill and Bianca Belair, as well as Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark in a Triple Threat Match. The match rules allowed the outcome without Cargill or Belair eating the pinfall, a necessity in protecting those competitors' seemingly unbeatable auras. More importantly, it represented a necessary step in Triple H and WWE Creative's attempt to evolve the women's tag team division. For years, the tag titles have been little more than props in ongoing storylines, traded between duos made up of individual stars in an attempt to further narratives rather than creating legitimate competition and a division fans could invest in. The first step in righting that wrong was the introduction of a babyface tandem that can carry the division, which we have in Belair and Cargill. So dominant is that team, though, that one of two things was bound to happen: the fans would grow tired of watching them beat up everyone turn on them or they would run out of credible opposition and find themselves in the same position as every set of champions before them. Saturday, Fyre and Dawn capitalized on the rules of the match, biding their time until they saw an opening and took it, becoming champions and basking in the adulation of their fellow countrypeople. Now, WWE has the opportunity to legitimize Unholy Union, reminding fans of their success in NXT and presenting them as a threat to Belair and Cargill in a way no other opponent has been. Damage CTRL's Asuka and Kairi Sane attempted to use experience to best them and it did not work. Baszler and Stark tried power and technique and failed. Fyre and Dawn can use their minds, outthinking their physically superior opponents and getting the best of them in several situations before eventually dropping the belts back to them. The division has long needed an actual rivalry that it can be built around, rather than a series of matches or short-term programs that do nothing for anyone involved, least of all the titles themselves. If Triple H is genuinely interested in building the division, not just booking the outcome to generate a hometown pop, The Unholy Union was a great choice to become a foundational piece of the division's rebuild.",

McIntyre fed off the crowd throughout the match. Priest eventually gained the advantage, looking for a dive to the outside, but got his right leg caught in the ropes as he flipped. Priest favored his ankle throughout the match but was able to hit a Razor’s Edge for two. McIntyre sent Priest down and set up for the Claymore, but Priest rolled out of the ring. McIntyre kicked Priest through the barricade and dragged him back into the ring. He set up for another Claymore when Priest reversed into the South of Heaven chokeslam for two. Priest hit a hurricarana off the top rope, but McIntyre jumped back to his feet and hit a Claymore out of nowhere for two. The referee was knocked out before McIntyre hit another Claymore. CM Punk ran down in a referee shirt and counted two before hitting a low blow and setting Priest up for the South of Heaven chokeslam for the win. Priest won the World Heavyweight championship at WrestleMania, cashing in his Money in the Bank briefcase five minutes after McIntyre had claimed the belt from Seth Rollins. On that night, it was CM Punk, who pulled a showboating McIntyre off the announce table in celebration and provided the opening for Priest’s win. Priest will now move on to face Gunther at SummerSlam, while it seems like we’re set up for a clash between Punk and McIntyre.",

Last night on NBA TV after Game 4 of the NBA Finals, Hall of Fame baller turned beloved sports analyst Charles Barkley announced that he will retired from television following the 2024-2025 NBA season. The 61-year-old’s exit will come just as Warner Bros. Discovery’s media rights deal with the NBA expires at the end of 2025. While TNT Sports’ future with the NBA remain uncertain, Barkley appeared steadfast in his decision to walk away after a successful and multi-Emmy Award winning career in media after 25 years. “I really love TNT, all the people who work here, NBA Television. You guys have been great to me for 24 years and I just want to say thank you to my entire NBA family. I love you guys,” Barkley began before asserting he would not be leaving TNT for another network, but rather retiring from broadcasting altogether,”I have made the decision myself, no matter what happens, next year is going to be my last year on television.” He went on to once again mention his love and gratitude for his NBA family before expressing wishes to “pass the baton,” for the NBA to stay with TNT, and to not give any more interviews on the subject of his departure. “Next year, I’m going to just retire after 25 years, and I just want to say thank you, and I wanted you all to hear it from me first.” While fans are sure to miss Barkley’s commentary, personality, and incredible interactions with Shaquille O’Neal, they can be sure to enjoy one last dance with the basketball legend before he moves on for good.",

                    "text": "NBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley said he plans to work one more season on television, then retire. Barkley, who works as an analyst on TNT’s “Inside the NBA” studio show, said Friday night that the 2024-25 season will be his last in his second career. The NBA has been negotiating its next broadcast rights deals, with Disney (ESPN), NBC, Amazon and Warner Bros. Discovery (TNT) in competition for reportedly three packages. New deals will begin in the 2025-26 season, and Barkley — a multiple Sports Emmy-award winner — said he isn’t interested in moving to other networks. He began with TNT in 2000, the year he retired following 16 seasons in the NBA. “I ain’t going nowhere other than TNT,” Barkley, 61, said on NBA TV. “But I have made the decision that, no matter what happens, next year is going to be my last year on television. And I just want to say thank you to my NBA family. You guys have been great to me. My heart is full with joy and gratitude.” TNT, however, issued a statement today that implied it hopes to work with the popular Barkley beyond next year. “Charles is a Hall of Famer and broadcasting icon who is and will always be a beloved member of the TNT Sports family,” the network said. “We’re looking forward to another fantastic NBA on TNT season and further discussion of our future plans with him.” If this really is the end of the road for Barkley, he had recommendations on who could potentially fill his analyst chair one day. “I hope the NBA stays with TNT, but for me personally, I wanted you guys to hear it from me … I wanted to tell my NBA TV and TNT family that I’m not going to another network, but I’m going to pass the baton to either Jamal Crawford or Vince Carter or you Steve (Smith),” Barkley said. “But next year, I’m going to just retire after 25 years, and I just wanted to say thank you. And I wanted y’all to hear it from me first.”",

                    "text": "June 15 (UPI) -- NBA and TV legend Charles Barkley said he plans to retire from broadcasting after the league's 2024-2025 season. Barkley announced his decision Friday night on NBATV after the Dallas Mavericks beat the Boston Celtics in Game 4 of the NBA Finals. His retirement plan coincides with Warner Bros. Discovery's deal with the NBA expiring after next season. It's unclear if WBD will keep the NBA as NBC and Amazon have reportedly outbid the media giant, according to the Wallstreet Journal. \"There's been a lot of noise around our network the last few months. I just wanna say, I've talked to all of the other networks, but I ain't going nowhere other than TNT,\" Barkley said. \"But, I have made the decision myself, no matter what happens, next year is going to be my last year on television. And I just want to say thank you to my NBA family. You guys have been great to me, my heart is full with joy and gratitude. But I'm gonna pass the baton at the end of next year.\" On Saturday, TNT said in a statement: \"Charles is a Hall of Famer and broadcasting icon who is and will always be a beloved member of the TNT Sports family,\" the statement read. \"We're looking forward to another fantastic NBA on TNT season and further discussion of our future plans with him.\" Barkley came into the public eye as a Hall-of-Fame basketball player, making 11 All-Star teams across 16 NBA seasons. He also won two Olympic gold medals, won the MVP award in 1993 and was named to the NBA's 50th and 75th anniversary team. Despite his illustrious playing career, he said he regrets having never won a championship. His transition to TV, however, might have netted him even more notoriety than his time on the court. Since joining TNT's award-winning studio show \"Inside the NBA,\" in 2000, Barkley had become a broadcasting icon with his baritone Alabama accent, no-nonsense attitude and humorous approach to sports commentating. In his almost 25 years on the network, Barkley won four Sports Emmys and was inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame. Barkley also has appeared as a studio analyst for the joint coverage by TNT and CBS of the NCAA Tournament in men's basketball since 2011. He briefly flirted with a career in politics, possibly putting in a bid for governor of Alabama, but he said the two-party system left him uninspired. \"I really thought hard about running for governor but then I realized, like, I don't think either one of these parties are really concerned about people and that's what America is: people,\" he said.",

Before Friday, the worst NBA Finals loss for the 17-time champion Celtics was 137-104 to the Lakers in 1984. This was worse. Much worse, at times. Dallas’ biggest lead in the fourth was 48 – the biggest deficit the Celtics have faced all season. The Celtics still lead the series 3-1, and Game 5 is in Boston on Monday. The loss – Boston’s first in five weeks – snapped the Celtics’ franchise-record, 10-game postseason winning streak, plus took away the chance of being the first team in NBA history to win both the conference finals and the NBA Finals in 4-0 sweeps. Jayson Tatum scored 15 points, Sam Hauser had 14, and Jaylen Brown and Jrue Holiday each finished with 10 for the Celtics. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 15 points, all in the fourth quarter, and Dereck Lively II had 11 points and 12 rebounds for Dallas. It was Lively who provided the hint that it was going to be a good night for the Mavs in the early going. He connected on a 3-pointer – the first of his NBA career – midway through the first quarter, a shot that gave the Mavs the lead for good. They were off and running from there. And kept running. It was 61-35 at the half, and Dallas left a ton of points unclaimed in the opening 24 minutes as well. The Mavs went into the break having shot only 5 of 15 from 3-point range and 10 of 16 from the foul line, but they were in total control anyway. The lowlights for Boston were many, some of them historic: • The 35 points represented the Celtics’ lowest-scoring total in a half in Joe Mazzulla’s two seasons as coach. • The 26-point halftime deficit was Boston’s second biggest of the season. The Celtics trailed Milwaukee by 37 at the break on Jan. 11, one of only eight instances in their first 99 games of this season where they trailed by double figures at halftime. • The halftime deficit was Boston’s largest ever in an NBA Finals game, and their 35 points was the second-lowest total. They managed only 31 points against the Lakers on June 15, 2010, which was Game 6 of a series that the Lakers claimed with a Game 7 victory. The Celtics surely were thinking about how making a little dent in the Dallas lead to open the second half could have made things interesting. Instead, the Mavs put things away quickly with a 15-7 run over the first 4:32 of the third, pushing their lead out to 76-42. Whatever hope Boston had of a pulling off a huge rally and capping a sweep was long gone. Mazzulla pulled the starters with 3:18 left in the third and Dallas leading 88-52. « Previous",

The Mavs salvaged a sweep in front of their home crowd in Game 4 of the NBA Finals on Friday, taking down the Boston Celtics, 122-84 — it was a third-largest margin of victory in Finals history. Dallas got off to a hot start, outscoring the Celtics, 31-24 in the first quarter, but as the Mavs kept up their scoring, the Celtics did not. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Boston was outscored in the second quarter, 27-14 — their 35 first-half points were their lowest in the entire season. The Mavericks shot 52.3% from the floor in the first half, while Boston made just 29.7%. Jayson Tatum had 15 points in the first 24 minutes, and still-likely Finals MVP Jaylen Brown had eight, but Jrue Holiday, Derrick White, Sam Hauser, and Xavier Tillman each had three points, so there wasn't much help from the supporting cast. LEBRON JAMES SHOWS SUPPORT FOR NBA DRAFT PROSPECT FOUND NOT GUILTY OF RAPE As for Dallas, it was the Luka Dončić show, as he put up 25 points in the first half, almost singlehandedly outscoring the Celtics himself in the first half — Kyrie Irving added 11. The Mavs kept their foot on the pedal, getting out to a 29-17 run to start the third quarter to go up 38, their largest lead of the night to that point (they wound up leading by 48), and it was smooth sailing from there, as both squads went with their B-teams the rest of the way. Tatum did not score in the second half, while Brown added just two more points. Irving finished with 21 points. The noise was loud for Dončić, who was heavily criticized after fouling out in Game 3 for poor body language and snapping at his coaches for poor plays he had made. He only scored four points in the second half, but he hardly needed to do much after Dallas' dominant second half. \"We can't lose no more — we're gonna believe to the end,\" he said after the game.

                    "text": "DALLAS — The Dallas Mavericks had two options. Pack for Boston, or pack for vacation. Boston awaits. The NBA Finals are not over, thanks to one of the biggest blowouts in title-round history. Luka Dončić scored 25 of his 29 points in the first half, Kyrie Irving added 21 and the Mavericks emphatically extended their season Friday night, fending off elimination with a 122-84 rout of the Celtics in Game 4. The 38-point final margin was the third-largest in an NBA Finals, behind only the Chicago Bulls beating the Utah Jazz 96-54 in 1998 and the Celtics beating the Los Angeles Lakers 131-92 in 2008. “It’s real simple. We don’t have to complicate this. This isn’t surgery,” Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. “Our group was ready to go. They were ready to celebrate and we made a stand. We were desperate. We’ve got to continue to keep playing that way. They’re trying to close the door. The hardest thing in this league is to close the door when you have a group that has nothing to lose. Tonight, you saw that.” The Mavs’ stars were done by the end of the third quarter, with good reason. It was all Dallas from the outset, the Mavs leading by 13 after one quarter, 26 at the half and by as many as 38 in the third before both sides emptied the benches. Before Friday, the worst NBA Finals loss for the 17-time champion Celtics was 137-104 to the Lakers in 1984. This was worse. Much worse, at times. Dallas’ biggest lead in the fourth was 48 — the biggest deficit the Celtics have faced all season. The Celtics still lead the series 3-1. Game 5 is Monday in Boston. “Preparation doesn’t guarantee an automatic success,” Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. “I thought we had a great process. I thought we had a great shootaround. Thought we had a great film session yesterday. I thought the guys came out with the right intentions. I just didn’t think it went our way, and I thought Dallas outplayed us. They just played harder.” The loss — Boston’s first in five weeks — snapped the Celtics’ 10-game postseason winning streak, longest in franchise history, plus took away the chance they had at being the first team in NBA history to win both the conference finals and the finals in 4-0 sweeps. Jayson Tatum scored 15 points, Sam Hauser had 14 while Jaylen Brown and Jrue Holiday each finished with 10 for the Celtics. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 15 points, all in the fourth quarter, and Dereck Lively II had 11 points and 12 rebounds for Dallas. It was Lively who provided the hint that it was going to be a good night for the Mavs in the early going. He connected on a 3-pointer — the first of his NBA career — midway through the first quarter, a shot that gave the Mavs the lead for good. And they were off and running from there. And kept running. “It doesn’t change anything,” Dončić said. “Like I said in the beginning of this series, it’s the first to four. And we’re going to believe until the end. We’re just going to keep going. I have big belief in this team that we can do it.” It was 61-35 at the half and Dallas left a ton of points unclaimed in the opening 24 minutes as well. The Mavs went into the break having shot only 5 of 15 from 3-point range, 10 of 16 from the foul line — and they were in total control anyway. The lowlights for Boston were many, some of them historic: The 35 points represented the Celtics’ lowest-scoring total in a half, either half, in Mazzulla’s two seasons as coach. The 26-point halftime deficit was Boston’s second biggest of the season. The Celtics trailed Milwaukee by 37 at the break on Jan. 11, one of only eight instances in their first 99 games of this season where they trailed by double figures at halftime. The halftime deficit was Boston’s largest ever in an NBA Finals game, and the 35-point number was the second-worst by the Celtics in the first half of one. They managed 31 against the Lakers on June 15, 2010, Game 6 of the series that the Lakers claimed with a Game 7 victory. Teams with a lead of 23 or more points at halftime, even in this season in which comebacks looked easier than ever before, were 76-0 entering Friday. Make it 77-0. Dončić’s jersey number, coincidentally enough. The Celtics surely were thinking about how making a little dent in the Dallas lead to open the second half could have made things interesting. Instead, the Mavs put things away and fast; a 15-7 run over the first 4:32 of the third pushed Dallas’ lead out to 76-42. Whatever hope Boston had of a pulling off a huge rally and capping off a sweep was long gone. Mazzulla pulled the starters, all of them, simultaneously with 3:18 left in the third and Dallas leading 88-52. The Mavs still have the steepest climb possible in this series, but the first step was done. “We have nothing to lose,” Kidd said.",

                    "text": "The Dallas Mavericks kept their slim championship hopes alive on Friday night as they beat the Boston Celtics to win their first game in this year’s NBA finals in emphatic fashion. Dallas came into Friday’s game trailing 0-3 in the best-of-seven series, a deficit no NBA team has ever recovered from in the postseason. Luka Dončić had attracted heavy criticism for his defensive deficiencies so far this series, but the Slovenian tightened that side of his game up while maintaining his usual offensive excellence, as he scored 29 points, 25 of them in the first half, in his team’s 122-84 beatdown victory. “We had to play our A-game,” said Mavericks coach Jason Kidd. “It was this or we go on vacation. I thought the group did a great job of not pressing, letting the game happen. The flow was there. We’ve done this in the first three games, we just hadn’t been able to capitalize.” Such was the one-sided nature of the game that by the time the fourth-quarter rolled around both teams had benched most of their starters. The 38-point final margin was the third-biggest ever in an NBA finals game, behind only Chicago beating Utah 96-54 in 1998 and the Celtics beating the Los Angeles Lakers 131-92 in 2008. At one point in the fourth quarter, the Mavs led by 48 points. The loss – Boston’s first in five weeks – snapped the Celtics’ franchise-record, 10-game postseason winning streak, and it took away the chance they had at being the first team in NBA history to win both the conference finals and the finals in 4-0 sweeps. “Preparation doesn’t guarantee an automatic success,” Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. “I thought we had a great process.

Kyrie Irving had 21 points for the Mavericks, while Dereck Lively grabbed 12 rebounds. The series now moves to Boston for Game 5 on Monday, when the Celtics will attempt to win a record-tying 18th NBA championship. After Friday’s performance that task looks a little tougher. “We got to play the same way [in Boston],” Dončić said after the game. “Their fans are going to be loud, so we have to stay focused and do the same things we did today.” Dončić has been carrying a number of injuries throughout the playoffs but winning seemed to help his aches and pains. Asked how he was feeling physically, Dončić grinned and replied “Amazing.”",

                    "text": "DALLAS >> Coach Jason Kidd had a simple explanation for why his Dallas Mavericks players brought their “A” game tonight. “It was this or we go on vacation,” Kidd said. Vacation plans have been put on hold as the Mavericks responded in impressive fashion in a win-or-go-home situation, routing the Boston Celtics 122-84 in Game 4 of the NBA Finals. Luka Doncic scored 25 of his 29 points in the first half and Kyrie Irving added 21 points while helping the Mavericks avoid a sweep. The scene shifts back to Boston for Game 5 on Monday as the Celtics will look to close it out at home. However, Dallas showed life today after Boston was the dominant team while winning the first three games of the best-of-seven series. The script flipped in Game 4. Doncic and the Mavericks got off to a fast start and didn’t look back. Doncic started a 10-0 spurt in the first quarter with a floater and closed it with a driving layup as Dallas took a 25-14 lead with 3:19 left in the period. That early run was a sign of things to come. “We were locked in, especially on the defensive end,” Doncic said. “We played with pace. It helped (my teammates). I’m here to help them in every way I can. We just got to play like that.” Dallas had a 34-21 lead by the end of the first quarter, scoring the final six points on 3-pointers by Irving and P.J. Washington. The Mavericks kept pouring it on. They doubled up the Celtics 50-25 on a layup by Irving at the 5:16 mark of the second quarter. To close the half, Maxi Kleber drilled a corner 3-pointer off an assist by Doncic. That gave Dallas a 61-35 lead at the break. The Mavericks shot 52.3 percent from the field compared to the Celtics’ 29.7 percent in the opening half. Dallas also won the rebounding battle 29-13 over the opening 24 minutes. “They came out desperate and I think they punched us in the mouth,” Celtics guard Jrue Holiday said, “and we couldn’t kind of recover the way we wanted to.” Dallas turned it into a full-on rout in the second half, leading by as many as 48, taking a 115-67 lead on a 3-pointer by Jaden Hardy with 5:58 left in the game. The Mavericks reached the 100-point mark several minutes before that on a 3-pointer by Tim Hardaway Jr. Dallas didn’t reach the 100-point mark in any of the first three games against Boston. Hardaway finished with 15 points on 5-of-7 shooting from 3-point range. All five of his treys were made during a 2:39 stretch in the fourth quarter. The Mavericks’ 38-point final margin of victory was the third largest in NBA Finals history. The Chicago Bulls beat the Utah Jazz by 42 points in Game 3 in 1998, and the Celtics crushed the Los Angeles Lakers by 39 in Game 6 in 2008. “It’s real simple. We don’t have to complicate this. This isn’t surgery,” Kidd said. “Our group was ready to go. They were ready to celebrate. We made a stand. We were desperate. We’ve got to continue to keep playing that way, understand they’re trying to find a way to close the door. “The hardest thing in this league is to close the door when you have a group that has nothing to lose. Tonight, you saw that.” For Boston, it was a letdown for a team that remains in control of the Finals. NBA teams are 156-0 when taking a 3-0 lead in a best-of-seven series. The loss snapped a 10-game winning streak for the Celtics, who dropped to 7-1 on the road in the playoffs. The Celtics were led by Jayson Tatum’s 15 points. Sam Hauser added 14 points, and Payton Pritchard had 11. “Preparation doesn’t guarantee an automatic success,” Boston coach Joe Mazzulla said. “I thought we had a great process. I thought we had a great shootaround. Thought we had a great film session (Thursday). I thought the guys came out with the right intentions. I just didn’t think it went our way. I thought Dallas outplayed us. They just played harder. “At the end of the day, we have to just maintain our process and get ready for Game 5.”",

Instead of wrapping up an unprecedented 18th NBA title, the Celtics suffered their worst loss ever in the NBA Finals — and one of the worst in league history — when they fell 122-84 on Friday night. “It happened, we can’t change it. We had a bad night,” Tatum said. “We always say you lose by two or you lose by 30, they all count the same. … We’re not making any excuses. We need to be better, and we will.” The Celtics’ 10-game postseason winning streak, a franchise record, ended after they lost on the road for the first time in these playoffs. They had been 7-0, including a Game 3 win in Dallas after overcoming a 13-point deficit midway through the first quarter. Now the Celtics will get a chance to clinch it at home. Game 5 is in Boston on Monday night. Dallas already had a 26-point lead at halftime, and any thoughts of a rally by the Celtics were pretty much done less than two minutes into the second half when Tatum had his shot blocked by Daniel Gafford, with the Boston forward reaching out as he fell and getting whistled for the foul. With the outcome already all but certain, coach Joe Mazzulla emptied his bench with 3:18 left in the third quarter. It was then a 36-point margin, and grew to as much as 48. “I thought the guys came out with the right intentions. I just didn’t think it went our way, and I thought Dallas outplayed us. They just played harder,” Mazzulla said. “You have to prepare to put yourself in the best possible position, but it doesn’t guarantee anything. At the end of the day, we have to just maintain our process and get ready for Game 5.” Tatum, who had 15 points and five rebounds, was on the bench with Jaylen Brown and the rest of the starters for the remainder of the night. And 7-foot-2 center Kristaps Porzingis never even removed his warmups after being declared available before the game. “We take it, we don’t dismiss it. We’re going to learn from it, see how and why, exactly where the game was won and lost,” Brown said. “Then we take those experiences and then we come out and we play like our life depends on it, because it does.” There have been only two more lopsided games this late in the season: Boston’s 131-92 win over the Lakers in Game 6 to wrap up the Celtics’ last championship in 2008; and Chicago’s record 42-point win over Utah in Game 3 in 1998. The Celtics had their lowest-scoring half all season — regular season and playoffs combined — when trailing 61-35 at halftime. They had missed 26 shots and had only two offensive rebounds. When it was all over, they had been outrebounded 52-31 and outscored in the paint 60-26. “We can say all these things about us. They played much better than us,” said Al Horford, the 38-year-old center seeking his first NBA title. “They clearly outplayed us, and that’s tough to take. But that’s the reality.”",

                    "title": "Charles Barkley Announced He&#8217;s Retiring From TV After Next Year, Whether TNT Gets An NBA Package Or Not",
                    "text": "Charles Barkley has been the biggest personality in the NBA media space for the last 24 years working with the NBA on TNT to make Inside the NBA the best studio show in sports. With the NBA apparently close to a new national TV rights deal with ESPN, NBC, and Amazon, the future of Inside and the entire crew is unclear, but the general sense has been Barkley will find himself a new TV home in the future as he has an out in his contract to give himself the opportunity to go elsewhere if TNT lost the NBA. However, after Game 4 of the NBA Finals, Barkley was on the NBATV set in Dallas and wanted to let the crew and basketball world know that he’s not going to any other network. Instead, Barkley announced he would be retiring after next season, which will be his 25th on television, whether TNT gets a piece of the package or not. “I just want to say thank you to my entire NBA family. I love you guys. There’s been a lot of noise around our network the last few months, and I just want to say, I talked to all the other networks, but I ain’t going nowhere other than TNT. But, I have made the decision myself, no matter what happens, next year is going to be my last year on television. And I just want to say thank you to my NBA family, you guys been great to me, my heart is full with joy and gratitude. But, I’m gonna pass the baton at the end of next year, I hope the NBA stays with TNT, but for me personally, I wanted you to hear it from me. Cause I’m not doing anymore interviews. Don’t y’all be calling me, nobody calling me. I’m not talking about this again. But I wanted to tell my NBATV and TNT family that I’m not going to another network, but I’m going to pass the baton to Jamal Crawford or Vince Carter or you, Steve [Smith]. But next year I’m gonna just retire after 25 years, and I just wanted to say thank you. And I wanted y’all to hear it from me first.” Now, this wouldn’t be the first time Barkley has announced intentions to retire — he rather famously said he wouldn’t do TV past the age of 60 but is now 61. That said, he certainly seems sincere in this statement. If this is the case, next year will be quite the farewell tour for Chuck and Inside the NBA, as the league will be losing one of its biggest voices and personalities from regular programming. I’d be surprised if Barkley simply rides off in the sunset never to be seen again — and I’m curious to find out how long his “no interviews” stance lasts — but if next year is indeed his last as a regular contributor from weekly NBA television, there will not be a true replacement for him because he is a legitimate 1-of-1. You can bet the other networks will try their best to talk him out of this stance, but if he’s genuinely set on calling it a career in television, he’s a first ballot Hall of Famer behind that desk just as he was on the court.",

                    "text": "Charles Barkley announced that he will retire from television after the 2024-25 NBA season during an appearance on NBATV after Game 4 of the NBA Finals on Friday night. Barkley, one of the greatest players in NBA history, has spent the past two-and-a-half decades as a television analyst for TNT's Inside the NBA. The beloved studio show may be nearing the end of its run as reports have indicated that Turner could lose its NBA broadcasting rights after next season, and now, it seems, one of the faces of that show is set to call it a career as well. As Barkley explained, he did speak with other networks about a possible role beyond the 2024-25 season, which is the last of the league's current broadcasting deal, but has ultimately decided that he is going to hang it up. Barkley said he is planning to retire \"no matter what happens\" with the future of TNT's rights. \"I've been thinking guys. I want to say this because you guys are my family. I really love TNT, all of the people who work here, NBA television, you guys have been great to me for 24 years, and I just want to say thank you to my entire NBA family. I love you guys. There's been a lot of noise around our network the last few months. I just wanna say, I've talked to all of the other networks, but I ain't going nowhere other than TNT. \"But, I have made the decision myself, no matter what happens, next year is gonna be my last year on television.

I just wanted to say thank you, and I wanted y'all to here it from me first.\" If Barkley does indeed follow through on his plans to retire, he will be closing one of the most decorated broadcasting careers in all of basketball. The entire cast of Inside the NBA has been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, and Barkley himself has also been inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame. Though he entered the American consciousness as a player (Barkley had a Hall of Fame playing career, making 11 All-Star teams across 16 NBA seasons for three different teams), he achieved a new level of mainstream stardom for his work on television, which began on Inside the NBA in 2000. One of the great broadcasting careers in all of sports appears to be coming to a close.",

While the league hasn't announced what the deals will look like, Disney/ABC/ESPN, Amazon, NBC and Warner Bros. Discovery have been vying for what's reported to be three available packages of games and affiliated content worth an estimated $76 billion to the league over a decade. If Warner Bros. Discovery is the odd media company out, it would mean the end of games on TNT and no more \"Inside the NBA.\" \"I hope the NBA stays with TNT, but for me personally, I wanted you guys to hear it from me ...

And I wanted y'all to hear it from me first.\" Ahead of the NBA Finals, commissioner Adam Silver called the media rights process \"incredibly complex\" based on the technology involved (broadcast, cable and streaming), the competing bidders and a timeline stretching into an unpredictable future. Asked about the potential end of the Sports Emmy Award-winning \"Inside the NBA,\" with host Ernie Johnson and former players Shaquille O'Neal, Kenny Smith and Barkley, if WBD's contract with the league next spring ended, Silver said he sympathized with the situation. \"[To] the folks at Turner Sports, I apologize that this has been a prolonged process, because I know they're committed to their jobs,\" he said. \"It's a large part of their identity and their family's identity, and no one likes this uncertainty. I think it's on the league office to bring these negotiations to a head and conclude them as quickly as we can.\"",

                    "text": "LONDON — Britain put on a display of birthday pageantry Saturday for King Charles III, a military parade that marked the Princess of Wales ' first public appearance since her cancer diagnosis early this year. The annual event was also a show of stability by the monarchy after months in which both the king and Kate, wife of heir to the throne Prince William, have been sidelined by cancer treatment. In a symbolic display of unity, Charles, Queen Camilla, William, Kate and their children were joined by other members of the royal family on a Buckingham Palace balcony at the end of the King's Birthday Parade. The family waved to the gathered crowd as they watched a flyby of military aircraft to cap ceremonies marking the monarch's official birthday. It was the first time Kate has appeared in public since December. She disclosed in March that she was undergoing chemotherapy for an unspecified form of cancer. ''I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days,'' Kate said in a statement released Friday, adding that she faces ''a few more months'' of treatment. Kate said she is ''not out of the woods yet'' and officials stress that Saturday's engagement does not herald a full return to public life. Huge crowds turn out each June to watch the birthday parade, also known as Trooping the Color, which begins with a procession involving horses, musicians and hundreds of soldiers in ceremonial uniform from Buckingham Palace. The first public sight of the 42-year-old princess came when she traveled in horse-drawn carriage from the palace down the grand avenue known as the Mall with her children George, 10, Charlotte, 9, and 6-year-old Louis. Bystanders cheered as they caught a glimpse of Kate, dressed in a white dress by designer Jenny Packham and wide-brimmed Philip Treacy hat. She watched the ceremony with the children from the window of a building overlooking Horse Guards Parade, a ceremonial parade ground in central London. Louis yawned broadly at one point in proceedings but mostly watched intently. Prince William, in military dress uniform, rode on horseback for the ceremony, in which troops parade past the king with their regimental flag, or ''color.'' The display of precision marching and martial music stems from the days when a regiment's flag was an essential rallying point in the fog of battle. Charles, who also is being treated for an undisclosed form of cancer, traveled in a carriage with Queen Camilla, rather than on horseback as he did last year. The king inspected the troops from a dais on the parade ground, saluting as elite regiments of Foot Guards marched past. Five regiments take it in turns to parade their color, and this year it was the turn of a company of the Irish Guards, which has Kate as its honorary colonel. The troops in scarlet tunics and bearskin hats were led onto the parade ground by their mascot, an Irish wolfhound named Seamus. Charles, 75, disclosed his cancer in February, and has recently eased back into public duties. He attended commemorations last week for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe on June 6, 1944. In one of the many quirks of British royal convention, Saturday is not the king's real birthday — that's in November. Like his mother Queen Elizabeth II before him, Charles has an official birthday on the second Saturday in June. The date was chosen because the weather is generally good, though early sunshine on Saturday gave way to a blustery, rainy day in London. The rain held off for most of the ceremony but began pelting down as the massed troops escorted the royal carriages back to Buckingham Palace past soggy but enthusiastic crowds. Blue sky returned as the family emerged onto the balcony to watch a flyby that included the Royal Air Force aerobatic team, the Red Arrows, trailing red, white and blue plumes of vapor. Thousands of royal fans in raincoats and umbrellas cheered, as a smattering of anti-monarchist protesters chanted ''Not my king.'' Spectators who braved the volatile weather were treated to a display of pomp and precision involving 1,400 soldiers, 250 military musicians and more than 200 horses. The equine participants included Trojan, Tennyson, and Vanquish, three of the five military horses who sparked mayhem in April when they bolted and ran loose through central London. The horses were performing routine exercises near Buckingham Palace on April 24 when they became spooked by noise from a nearby building site and galloped loose through the capital's streets, crashing into vehicles and causing chaos during the morning rush hour. The army says the other two horses are recovering well and are also expected to return to duty.",

Kate said in her statement that she is “not out of the woods yet” and officials stress that Saturday’s engagement does not herald a full return to public life. Huge crowds turn out each June to watch the parade, also known as Trooping the Color, which begins with a procession involving horses, musicians and hundreds of soldiers in ceremonial uniform from Buckingham Palace. Prince William, in military dress uniform, rode on horseback for the ceremony, in which troops in ceremonial finery parade past the king with their regimental flag, or “color.” The display of precision marching and martial music stems from the days when a regiment’s flag was an essential rallying point in the fog of battle. Charles, who also is being treated for an undisclosed form of cancer, traveled in a carriage with Queen Camilla, rather than on horseback as he did last year. The king inspected the troops from a dais on the parade ground, saluting as elite regiments of Foot Guards marched past. Five regiments take it in turns to parade their color, and this year it was the turn of a company of the Irish Guards, which has Kate as its honorary colonel. The troops in scarlet tunics and bearskin hats were led onto the parade ground by their mascot, an Irish wolfhound named Seamus. Charles, 75, disclosed his cancer in February, and has recently eased back into public duties. He attended commemorations last week for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe on June 6, 1944. In one of the many quirks of British royal convention, Saturday is not the king’s real birthday — that’s in November. Like his mother Queen Elizabeth II before him, Charles has an official birthday on the second Saturday in June. The date was chosen because the weather is generally good, though early sunshine on Saturday gave way to a blustery, rainy day in London. The rain held off for most of the ceremony but began pelting down as the massed troops escorted the royal carriages back to Buckingham Palace, to cheers from soggy but enthusiastic crowds. Royal fans in raincoats and umbrellas had already gathered along the route several hours before start time, along with a smattering of anti-monarchist protesters chanting “Not my king.” Spectators were treated to a display of pomp and precision involving 1,400 soldiers, 250 military musicians and more than 200 horses. The equine participants included Trojan, Tennyson, and Vanquish, three of the five military horses who sparked mayhem in April when they bolted and ran loose through central London. The horses were performing routine exercises near Buckingham Palace on April 24 when they became spooked by noise from a nearby building site and galloped loose through the capital’s streets, crashing into vehicles and causing chaos during the morning rush hour. The army says the other two horses are recovering well and are also expected to return to duty. (Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

                    "text": "LONDON — Britain put on a display of birthday pageantry Saturday for King Charles III, a military parade that marked the Princess of Wales ’ first public appearance since her cancer diagnosis early this year. The annual event was also a show of stability by the monarchy after months in which both the king and Kate, wife of heir to the throne Prince William, have been sidelined by cancer treatment. In a symbolic display of unity, Charles, Queen Camilla, William, Kate and their children were joined by other members of the royal family on a Buckingham Palace balcony at the end of the King’s Birthday Parade. The family waved to the gathered crowd as they watched a flyby of military aircraft to cap ceremonies marking the monarch’s official birthday. It was the first time Kate has appeared in public since December. She disclosed in March that she was undergoing chemotherapy for an unspecified form of cancer. “I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days,” Kate said in a statement released Friday, adding that she faces “a few more months” of treatment.

                    "text": "The Princess of Wales has made a triumphant return to public life in the midst of her cancer treatment and joined the royal family to celebrate the king’s official birthday. Kate and her three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, were cheered by crowds in The Mall as they left Buckingham Palace in a carriage procession for the Trooping the Colour ceremony. After spending much of the year coming to terms with the diagnosis and receiving ongoing chemotherapy, the future queen looked relaxed as she travelled along one of London’s most famous thoroughfares with her family in the glass state coach. Her appearance was in doubt after she missed the final Trooping rehearsal last weekend, but with King Charles also suffering from cancer, the spectacle of military pomp and pageantry became a symbolic statement by the monarchy after a period of uncertainty. She was surrounded by other members of the family, with her husband the Prince of Wales, Colonel of the Welsh Guards, on horseback, as were the Princess Royal, Colonel Blues and Royals, and the Duke of Edinburgh, Colonel Scots Guards. The king also rode in a carriage with the queen, a departure from last year because of his illness, and he will inspect the officers and guardsmen on Horse Guards Parade in Whitehall from the coach rather than from a horse. Kate said in a statement on Friday she was making “good progress” with her treatment, but candidly said she has “good days and bad days” and although she has been working from home, said “I am not out of the woods yet.” Support from the public has made a deep impression on the princess, who said she had been “blown away” by the “kind messages” that had made a “world of difference to William and me and has helped us both through some of the harder times.” She was greeted by a sea of faces as the royal party turned from The Mall into Horse Guards Parade, with the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence together in a carriage, while the Duchess of Edinburgh travelled in a coach with her daughter Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and the Duke of Kent. The royal party were in the midst of a sovereign’s mounted escort, formed by troops from the Household Cavalry’s Life Guards and Blues and Royals. In the rear rank was Tennyson, one of the five horses injured when they ran through the streets of London after being spooked by construction noise. In a change from last year, Kate did not join senior family members on a dais, but watched the spectacle from the Duke of Wellington’s former office with her children. Charles is Colonel in Chief of the regiments of the Household Division which include the Life Guards, Blues and Royals, and all five regiments of Foot Guards—the Welsh, Scots, Irish, Coldstream and Grenadier—on parade for the official birthday, alongside the mounted Band of the Household Cavalry and the massed Foot Guards bands. The military spectacle, also known as the Birthday Parade is a gift from the Household Division, and Charles first attended in 1951, aged three, riding in a carriage with his grandmother, the Queen Mother, and aunt, Princess Margaret, and first rode as Colonel of the Welsh Guards in 1975. Trooping the Colour is a social as well as a ceremonial occasion and the stands overlooking the parade ground were filled with about 8,000 spouses, girlfriends, and parents of the guardsmen and officers on parade. It featured more than 1,250 soldiers, and hundreds of Guardsmen were lined up on the parade ground waiting to be inspected by the King from his carriage with Camilla, Colonel of the Grenadier Guards, and joined by the mounted royal Colonels. The colour, or regimental flag, that will be trooped will be the King’s Colour of number 9 company, Irish Guards. When the royal carriages finally came to a stop Louis was the first to leave, followed by his elder brother George and sister Charlotte. Finally, Kate stepped down wearing wearing a Jenny Packham dress, hat by Philip Treacy and the Irish Guards Regimental Brooch, as she is the regiment’s Colonel. When the inspection of the Guardsmen in their scarlet tunics and bearskins began, the king cast his eye over the servicemen who are fighting soldiers when not performing ceremonial duties. Sat beside him in the carriage was the queen who wore a pale green silk crepe dress and coat by Anna Valentine, Philip Treacy hat, and her Grenadier Guards military brooch. During the pageantry the colour was first trooped through the ranks of soldiers before the guardsmen marched past the King, first in slow then in quick time with the King acknowledging the command of “eyes right” with a salute. For the first time in more than 100 years, soldiers on parade were allowed to have beards. The rule change, which applies across the Army, was approved by the king earlier this year after facial hair was only allowed for religious, medical, or role specific reasons.",

                    "text": "Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis are taking part in the parade! The three children of Kate Middleton and Prince William returned to Trooping the Colour on June 15, riding through London in a horse-drawn carriage from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards Parade as part of the festivities marking King Charles' official birthday. Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 9, and Prince Louis, 6, were joined by their mom, 42, in the coach while Prince William, 41, rode in the procession on horseback. Prince Louis and Princess Kate sat side-by-side facing forward while Prince George and Princess Charlotte sat across from them. They rode in the Glass Coach rather than the event's usual open-top carriages, shielding them from the rainy weather. The Glass Coach, built in 1881 and purchased for King George V’s coronation in 1911, has brought many royal brides to their weddings, including Princess Anne in 1973, Princess Diana in 1981 and Sarah Ferguson in 1986. The Princess of Wales' appearance at Trooping the Colour marked her first public outing with the royal family since Christmas amid her cancer treatment. Her participation was confirmed the day prior in a personal letter sharing an update on her health. \"I'm looking forward to attending the King’s Birthday Parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer, but equally knowing I am not out of the woods yet,\" she said in the message. The trio of royal siblings made their carriage debut at Trooping the Colour in 2022, which doubled as the first major event of the late Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee celebrations that marked her historic 70-year reign.

The royal siblings rode in the procession again last year when the event celebrated their grandfather King Charles' birthday for the first time in his reign, sharing a carriage with mom Princess Kate and Queen Camilla. George, Charlotte and Louis coordinated in red, white and blue ensembles for the occasion. The young royals also rode in a horse-drawn carriage following the coronation of King Charles and Queen Camilla on May 6, 2023. Sitting opposite their parents, the Prince and Princess of Wales, the children showed off their royal waves to the thousands gathered along the route from Westminster Abbey to Buckingham Palace. After their carriage ride back to Buckingham Palace, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis will join members of the royal family on the royal residence's balcony to take in the Royal Air Force's flypast. Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis all made their debuts on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the flypast at Trooping the Colour before their first time riding in the procession in 2022. Prince George made his first appearance at Trooping the Colour in 2015 carried by dad Prince William, while Princess Charlotte made her adorable debut the following year in a pink ensemble. It was Prince Louis' turn to steal the show in 2019, excitedly waving and pointing to the sky during his first balcony appearance.",

On June 15, Kate and Prince William posted a behind-the-scenes video on their social media accounts of the Princess of Wales, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis awaiting their carriage for King Charles' birthday parade. \"All set for the King's Birthday Parade!\" they captioned the clip. In the video, Kate, 42, lovingly touches her 9-year-old daughter's long hair as the three siblings wait patiently for their carriage. The family rode in the Glass Coach rather than the event's usual open-top carriages, protecting them from the wet weather. Louis, 6, waves to the carriage drivers as they pull up to the steps of Buckingham Palace. Charlotte gives a sweet smile while inside the carriage, seated next to her big brother George, 10. The carriage then rides off to join the royal processional. This marks Kate's first public event in six months after she announced in March that she has cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy. Princess Kate's attendance at King Charles' annual birthday parade was confirmed the day prior as she released a new photo and personal letter updating her health. After undergoing abdominal surgery in January, Kate announced in an emotional video released on March 22 that post-operative tests led to a cancer diagnosis and that she was undergoing chemotherapy. \"Family is really important to the Princess of Wales and she wanted to be there to support her family,\" a royal source said of Kate's decision to attend Trooping the Colour. While Princess Kate has maintained a low profile in the months since her cancer announcement as she focuses on her recovery, she was recently spotted out with her family as well as running errands solo, sources told PEOPLE.

The young princes twinned in dapper double-breasted suits, white shirts and bright blue ties for the annual celebration of the reigning monarch’s birthday. Prince Louis, 6, wore shorts, while George, who will celebrate his 11th birthday next month, sported slacks. The jackets appear to be the same ones the young royals wore to the same event last year, though Prince Louis wore bright red shorts in 2023 to complement his tie. Princess Charlotte, 9, went for a navy-and-white sailor dress similar to the red-and-white one she wore last year. She accessorized with white Papouelli Mary Jane flats and a matching bow in her hair. The Princess of Wales, 42, made her triumphant return to public life Saturday after six months spent privately recovering from abdominal surgery and chemotherapy for an unspecified form of cancer. For the occasion, Middleton selected a white Jenny Packham dress trimmed with a black-striped belt and bow at the collar. She added a Philip Treacy hat, white Jimmy Choo pumps and a Mulberry clutch ($750). She wore Cassandra Goad pearl earrings ($6,061) and a brooch featuring the insignia of the Irish Guards, of which she serves as honorary colonel. Queen Camilla opted for a white hat and mint green coat dress, while Prince William and King Charles both wore red uniforms with their full regalia.",

Kate Middleton and Princess Charlotte were seen wiping away condensation from the window of her carriage as they attended the Trooping the Colour ceremony in London on Saturday, June 15. While Kate and her children had shelter from the wet weather, Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, 59, did not — appearing to get wet by the rain as she headed to the parade in an open carriage with her daughter Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor. The Princess of Wales, 42, made her first public appearance since announcing her cancer diagnosis in March in an enclosed horse-drawn carriage at the ceremony with her children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. The rainy weather at Trooping the Colour comes after King Charles' coronation was also hit by rain in May 2023. During the ceremony, the King and Queen Camilla arrived in the enclosed Gold State Coach, sheltering the monarchs from the rain, as they rode down the Mall past spectators who had gathered in their thousands outside in the wet weather. In a video posted on X (formerly Twitter), Prince Louis waved from inside a car in the rain as he headed to the ceremony with his family. Despite the wet weather at the coronation, the traditional flypast held for the King went ahead at the ceremony. The heavy rain at this year’s Trooping the Colour put the air spectacle over Buckingham Palace in jeopardy, but it went off without a hitch. Can't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

                    "text": "It was a mother-son moment caught on camera for the world to see. Kate Middleton and her youngest son, Prince Louis, shared a sweet exchange at Trooping the Colour on Saturday. The Princess of Wales — who made her first public appearance since her shock cancer diagnosis in March — arrived at Buckingham Palace in a horse-drawn carriage with her three children: Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 9, and Louis, 6. Kate sat next to her youngest son who was seen speaking with his mom while sporting an animated expression on her face. Lip reader Gaby Lane told The Sun that little Louis mouthed the words “Look over there ma” as he pointed to crowds lined along the Mall in Central London. “Right, look at that,” Kate replied, according to Lane. Later, Louis had another sweet moment with Kate and his dad, Prince William, while standing on the balcony of Buckingham Palace watching a flyover performed to honor King Charles’ birthday. Louis seemed awed by the 30 jets as they flew over the palace, which let out plumes of red, white and blue smoke. “Papa, Papa, Papa, look at all that color!” the little prince said to William, according to lip-reading Lane. Kate was seen smiling at her youngest son, before telling him that the planes had finally “dispersed.” While lovable Louis usually steals the show at royal events, all eyes were on Princess Kate who appeared to be fighting fit as she continues chemotherapy treatment for an undisclosed form of cancer.",

                    "text": "We had to wait more than two months, but the first Boston Red Sox vs. New York Yankees series of 2024 has arrived, and it did not take long for things to get interesting at Fenway Park. In the first inning of Friday night's series opener (GameTracker), Alex Verdugo clubbed a first-pitch home run against his former team after the crowd greeted him with boos. Here is Verdugo's blast. This is no cheapie. He hit it to dead center field and certainly seemed to enjoy himself rounding the bases: Earlier in the day Friday, Verdugo told reporters he expected to be treated \"like a Yankee\" by the Fenway Park crowd, and that he was. He heard boos on par with what Aaron Judge and Juan Soto, who doubled earlier in that first inning, heard before their at-bats. Verdugo was a solid player during his four years in Boston, though he was benched multiple times for not hustling. Last season, he was also reprimanded after he showed up late to the ballpark. Earlier this week, he said he enjoyed playing for the Red Sox but wishes they had done more to improve the team at the trade deadline in 2022 and 2023. The Yankees and Red Sox hooked up for a rare trade in December that sent Verdugo to New York for three pitching prospects. He took a .259/.314/.418 batting line and eight home runs into Friday's game. Verdugo also rates as one of the league's best defensive left fielders this year. He will be a free agent after the season. At 49-22, the Yankees took baseball's best record into this weekend's series. The Red Sox are in third place in the AL East at 35-34.",

                    "text": "Alex Verdugo said all the right things pregame. The ex-Red Sox outfielder spoke positively about his time in Boston, downplayed the tumult that occasionally bubbled between him and manager Alex Cora and talked about how tight he remains with his former teammates. Yet as he rounded the bases, you could tell just how much it meant for him to get one over on his former team. In his first at bat back at Fenway Park since being traded to the New York Yankees this past offseason, Verdugo crushed the first pitch he saw 404 feet to dead center field for a two-run home run. Even without his trademark beard Verdugo was every bit his old self, celebrating the home run like he’d hit a walk-off in the World Series. Alex Verdugo was HYPED after homering on his first pitch back at Fenway Park. pic.twitter.com/48dKjpoZ8f — MLB (@MLB) June 14, 2024 And that was just the start. Verdugo went 3 for 5 with four RBI, a double and the home run to lead his new team to a 8-1 win over the Red Sox in Friday’s series opener. All three of his hits drove in a run, and thanks to his effort the Yankees are now the first team in MLB to reach 50 wins this season. The Red Sox, on the other hand, now fall to .500 for the 18th time this season at 35-35. Shortly before Verdugo’s home run, Juan Soto introduced himself to the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry by launching a sky-high fly ball that scraped the Green Monster for a stand-up double. After the homer Boston was victimized by a couple of costly self-inflicted miscues. The first came later in the first inning after Giancarlo Stanton walked and Anthony Rizzo singled to put two men on. As he attempted to stretch his hit into a double Rizzo was caught in a rundown that should have ended the inning, but Dom Smith anticipating Stanton breaking for home, and instead of taking the out he threw to the plate. Stanton did not break for home, and as a result Rizzo reached second safely. Brayan Bello was able to escape the ensuing second-and-third jam without further damage, but he didn’t help his own cause later in the third. After allowing a single to Stanton and a walk to Rizzo to start the inning he drew a double play and what should have been an inning ending groundout to first, but as he went to cover the bag Bello dropped the routine throw, allowing Stanton to score and make it 3-0. Giving away runs to a team with the best record in baseball is never a recipe for success, especially when they have a guy on the mound who ranks near the top of the leaderboard in nearly every category. Coming into Friday Yankees starter Luis Gil ranked second in the American League in ERA (2.04), third in walks and hits per innings pitched (0.933) and tied for third in wins (8). The 26-year-old right-hander has emerged as an early contender for AL Rookie of the Year, and while Friday wasn’t one of his best efforts of the season, he still largely kept the Red Sox at bay. Boston got men in scoring position with one out in both the third and fourth innings but couldn’t fully capitalize on either opportunity. In the third Gil got a flyout and a strikeout to escape unscathed, and in the fourth Enmanuel Valdez got him for an RBI double to make it 3-1, but Gil responded by striking out Dom Smith and Ceddanne Rafaela to strand men at second and third. Gil ultimately allowed one run over five innings, allowing four hits and four walks while striking out six. He finished with 104 pitches, forcing Masataka Yoshida to ground out to second to finish his outing. Meanwhile, Bello was inefficient and made it through just 4.2 innings himself. He was charged with four earned runs on six hits, three walks and five strikeouts, and his ERA on the season is now an even 5.00 through 12 starts. Verdugo had an RBI double off Bello with one out in the fifth, and after Cam Booser came on in relief with two outs in the inning Rizzo came up with an RBI single. Jose Trevino added a solo home run in the top of the ninth, Aaron Judge tacked on an RBI double and Verdugo finished the job with an RBI single to round out the scoring. Those each prompted loud “Let’s go Yankees!” chants to break out at Fenway Park, a previously unthinkable occurrence but one likely to become more common as opposing fans continue taking over the ballpark. Ultimately the Red Sox got plenty of men on base, drawing seven walks as a team, but they couldn’t come up with enough big hits when it counted. At one point Boston drew two walks in three consecutive innings but were only able to convert those into one run. Boston collectively struck out 14 times, stranded 11 men on base and went 1 for 11 with runners in scoring position. Verdugo had three hits in those situations on his own. On some level the way Friday played out was entirely predictable. Verdugo’s time in Boston may have been marked by inconsistency, but the man never lacked confidence and made no secret his willingness to use perceived slights as motivation. Verdugo lives for nights like this, and while the Red Sox likely don’t have any regrets about the trade, he made sure that for one night his former club paid for their decision. And as he did, Verdugo relished every moment.",

Verdugo spent four seasons with the Red Sox before being traded to New York in December in a rare deal between the AL East division rivals. “To come over here, do what we did as a team and obviously the swing that I put on in the first to give us the lead, it was a big moment,” Verdugo said. “It felt like a lot of relief for me, and also just a lot of anticipation for this matchup. “It was pure adrenaline, just fired up. Wasn’t really expecting to swing at the first pitch and to put it out of the ballpark and give us the early 2-0 lead was big. I kind of let a little yell out when I rounded first, and when I hit second, I saw my dugout going crazy, so I just kind of lost it again.” Verdugo hit the first pitch he saw from Boston right-hander Brayan Bello to straightaway center field for his ninth homer of the season, scoring Juan Soto, who reached on a double. The 28-year-old right fielder added an RBI double in the fifth inning and a run-scoring single in the ninth. “That’s really impressive,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “I’ve been there, where you go back and play, and from my experience, it’s odd, it’s hard to normalize things. He was very calm before the game. In my mind, maybe he was a little nervous. But, he came right out and delivered a punch on the first pitch and didn’t stop.

They have a good offense, but with that, we have to be more aggressive in the strike zone.” Bello (6-4) went 4 2/3 innings, giving up five runs, four earned, on six hits and three walks with five strikeouts. “I think the start was going well and I got out of rhythm,” Bello said. “They were hitting the ball in the big moments and I think that was the key.” In the ninth, Yankees No. 9 hitter Jose Trevino hit a solo home run off right-hander Chase Anderson, his seventh of the season.

                    "text": "BOSTON — Alex Verdugo had a two-run homer and four RBI in his return to Fenway Park, and Luis Gil struck out six as the MLB-leading New York Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox 8-1 on Friday night. Verdugo spent four seasons with the Red Sox before being traded to New York in December in a rare deal between the AL East division rivals. Verdugo hit the first pitch he saw from Boston right-hander Brayan Bello to straightaway center field for his ninth homer of the season, scoring Juan Soto, who reached on a double. The 28-year-old right fielder added an RBI double in the fifth inning and a run-scoring single in the ninth. Gil (9-1) worked five innings, giving up one run on four hits with four walks. The 26-year-old righty threw a season-high 104 pitches. In his last nine starts, Gil is 8-0 with a 1.14 ERA, giving up seven earned runs over 55 1/3 innings. The Yankees (50-22) got a run in the fourth after Giancarlo Stanton led off with a single and Anthony Rizzo walked. After Gleyber Torres grounded into a double play, it appeared Bello got out of the inning on Oswalda Cabrera’s groundball to first baseman Dominic Smith. But Bello’s error attempting to cover first allowed Stanton to score. The Yankees added two runs in the fifth when Anthony Volpe singled to open the inning. Aaron Judge followed with a one-out walk. Verdugo’s double scored Volpe and sent Judge to third. After Giancarlo Stanton struck out, Bello’s outing was done. He was replaced by left-hander Cam Booser, who gave up a run-scoring single to Rizzo. Bello (6-4) went 4 2/3 innings, giving up five runs, four earned, on six hits and three walks with five strikeouts. In the ninth, Yankees No. 9 hitter Jose Trevino hit a solo home run off right-hander Chase Anderson, his seventh of the season. With two outs, Soto walked and score on a double by Judge. Verdugo followed with a single that scored Judge. New York relievers Tommy Kahnle, Caleb Ferguson, Victor González and Michael Tonkin combined to pitch four scoreless innings with eight strikeouts. Ferguson struck out all four batters he faced. Boston’s run came in the fourth when Gil issued consecutive walks to Rafael Devers and Masataka Yoshida to open the inning. Devers scored on Enmanual Valdez’s double. TRAINER’S ROOM Yankees: Reigning American League Cy Young Award winner Gerrit Cole, on the injured list all season because of right elbow inflammation, made his third rehab start on Friday, going 4 1/3 innings, giving up one run on two hits with 10 strikeouts for Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. Yankees Manager Aaron Boone was asked before the game against the Red Sox if that would be Cole’s final rehab start. “We’ll see,” Boone replied.

(AP) — Emergency crews in Oregon rescued 30 people Friday after they were stuck for close to half an hour dangling upside down high on a ride at a century-old amusement park.

                    "text": "Dozens of riders got trapped upside down for half an hour on a popular thrill ride at a Portland, Ore. amusement park on Friday — but riders said it felt like hours. The AtmosFEAR ride at Oaks Park malfunctioned around 2:55 p.m., stranding 28 riders with their legs facing the sky, KGW8 reported. The park initiated its emergency procedures and called 911. The ride was manually lowered around 3:25 and all the passengers were safely removed, Portland Fire and Rescue said. One person with a pre-existing medical condition was taken to an area hospital “out of an abundance of caution,” Oaks Park said. Portland teens Daniel Allen and Jordan Harding were at the park celebrating their high school graduation. As soon as they arrived they rushed to get on line to ride AtmosFEAR. Before they knew it, they were dangling upside down. “I was excited to go on,” Allen told KGW8. “When you get stuck up there, I don’t think you’re so excited anymore.” AtmosFEAR, which opened in 2021, consists of a pendulum that swings from side to side. It stops upside down as a regular part of the ride — but only for a moment before swinging back. When the ride didn’t resume after the inverted pause, they realized something was wrong. “We were just freaking out,” Harding said. “People were crying. They were just putting into the universe what they wanted to say for their last words.” The pair said the upside-down position they were stuck in was extremely uncomfortable and Harding’s legs fell asleep from the waist-down. Although she’s not religious, she said she started to pray. “I didn’t think I was going to live to see it right now,” she told the outlet. Oaks Park said AtmosFEAR would remain closed until further notice. “Any park guest who had their visit cut short today will be extended a refund or opportunity to reschedule their visit,” Oaks Park said in a statement.",

It was the first day of the summer season for the 119-year-old park, Oregon’s oldest. The ride stopped at the apex position at 2:55 p.m., Oaks Park said in a Facebook post. The park then went into emergency response protocols, and other guests evacuated the park. Portland Fire & Rescue reached the park and was ready if needed to perform a high-angle rope rescue. Park staff with the aid of firefighters manually overrode the system and got the ride back on the ground nine minutes later, Portland fire officials said in a news release. All of the riders were medically evaluated on the ground, with one taken to the hospital for further observation, Portland fire officials said. “My entire bladder hurts. I was holding back throw up. My legs are killing me,” one of the riders, Daniel Allen, 17, told Portland CBS affiliate KOIN. Another rider, Jordan Harding, 18, said, “People praying to God, screaming for their life, throwing up, passing out. It was bad.” The AtmosFEAR ride, which has 180 degree and 360 degree modes, had operated without incident since 2021, Oaks Park officials said. It has been shut down indefinitely, and the park is working with the ride’s unspecified manufacturers and state officials to find out why the ride stopped in the apex position. “We wish to express our deepest appreciation to the first responders and our staff for taking prompt action, leading to a positive outcome today, and to the rest of the park guests who swiftly followed directions to vacate the park to make way for the emergency responders to attend to the situation. Most of all, we are thankful that the riders are safe and with their families,” the park said.",

According to the amusement park, the ride operators working on AtmosFEAR — which can operate on either a 180- or 360-degree setting as it sends its riders flipping through the air on a loop — called 911 and began initiating \"emergency procedures.\" First responders, including Portland Fire & Rescue, arrived on the scene around 3:20 p.m., the park said.

I was more happy, I was alive. I don't think I've ever appreciated my life more. This is really an acknowledgement moment for me,\" he told the outlet. Fellow AtmosFEAR rider Jordan Harding also told the outlet that although she did not suffer any medical issues from being stuck upside down, the entire experience was uncomfortable. \"My entire waist below was asleep,\" she said. \"[A fellow rider] told me, he was like, 'You have to hold your legs back.' It was so hard. It was so bad.\" \"So there's this like woman firefighter, and she's like tiny, and she's like, 'Oh I got you,' \" Harding continued, describing her rescuer. \"I'm like, 'Are you sure?' And she literally, like, picked me up, and I was just so overwhelmed and everything, I gave her, like, the biggest hug.\" One rider, who had pre-existing health conditions prior to the incident, was transported to a local hospital as a precaution, the park said. All other riders were assessed by first responders and given the go-ahead to go home. According to a Facebook post shared by Portland Fire on Saturday, June 15, rescue teams had previously trained for this scenario, and the amusement park added in its statement that the team had even been trained to respond to an emergency on this exact ride.

We leave nothing to chance as we preplan and train on what 'could' happen before it actually happens.\" According to the park, AtmosFEAR first opened in 2021 and has \"operated without incident\" until Friday — which was also the park's first day of operation for the 2024 summer season.

                    "title": "Alex Jones’ Personal Assets to Be Sold to Pay $1.5B Sandy Hook Debt. Company Bankruptcy is Dismissed",
                    "text": "HOUSTON — A federal judge on Friday ordered the liquidation of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones ′ personal assets but dismissed his company’s separate bankruptcy case, leaving the immediate future of his Infowars media platform uncertain as he owes $1.5 billion for his false claims that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. Judge Christopher Lopez approved converting Jones’ proposed personal bankruptcy reorganization to a liquidation. But Lopez threw out the case of his company, Austin, Texas-based Free Speech Systems, after failed attempts by Jones to reach an agreement with Sandy Hook families on his proposals to reorganize and keep operating the company while paying them millions of dollars. It wasn’t immediately clear what will happen in the coming weeks to Free Speech Systems, Infowars’ parent company, whic Jones built into a multimillion-dollar moneymaker over the past 25 years by selling dietary supplements and other products. But both Jones and lawyers for the Sandy Hook families said they expect Infowars to cease operating at some point because of the huge debt. A trustee appointed Friday in Jones’ personal bankruptcy case to oversee the liquidation now has control over his assets, including Infowars, according to lawyers for Sandy Hook families. Dismissal of Free Speech Systems’ case means the families can now move immediately to collect on the $1.5 billion in state courts in Texas and Connecticut where they won defamation lawsuits against Jones and the company. It’s possible Infowars will continuing operating during the collection efforts, which could include selling off the company’s assets. Jones, who smiled as the judge dismissed the company’s case, called in to Infowars after the court hearing and predicted more battles in the state courts. “The bizarre political attempts to hijack the operation have failed,” he said, and added that he would find another way to broadcast his shows if he loses Infowars. Outside the courthouse, he railed about the families not accepting his reorganization proposals and alleged that they were being used by political groups in a conspiracy to silence him. He said he would try to maximize revenues at Infowars to make money for creditors and then wind down the business in a way that takes care of its 44 employees. “This is about taking me off the air,” Jones said. “Understand that what you’ve seen in the corporate media about me, or what I said about Sandy Hook or any of this, has no bearing on reality.” Chris Mattei, a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families, called Infowars “soon-to-be defunct” as his clients move to collect on the debt in state courts. He said the families will also pursue Jones’ future earnings. “Today is a good day,” Mattei said in a text message after the hearing. “Alex Jones has lost ownership of Infowars, the corrupt business he has used for years to attack the Connecticut families and so many others. … Alex Jones is neither a martyr nor a victim. He is the perpetrator of the worst defamation in American history.” Lopez had been asked to either convert Free Speech Systems’ bankruptcy reorganization to a liquidation or dismiss the case. He said his sole focus was what would be best for the company and its creditors. He also said Free Speech Systems’ case appeared to be one of the longest running of its kind in the country, and it was approaching a deadline to resolve it. “I was never asked today to make a decision to shut down a show or not. That was never going to happen today one way or another,” Lopez said. “This case is one of the more difficult cases I’ve had. When you look at it, I think creditors are better served in pursuing their state court rights.” Many of Jones’ personal assets will be sold off, but his primary home in the Austin area and some other belongings are exempt from bankruptcy liquidation. He already has moved to sell his Texas ranch worth about $2.8 million, a gun collection and other assets to pay debts. In the lead-up to Friday’s hearing, Jones had been telling his web viewers and radio listeners that Free Speech Systems was on the verge of being shut down because of the bankruptcy. He urged them to download videos from his online archive to preserve them and pointed them to a new website of his father’s company if they want to continue buying the dietary supplements he sells on his show. Jones has about $9 million in personal assets, according to the most recent financial filings in court. Free Speech Systems has about $6 million in cash on hand and about $1.2 million worth of inventory, according to J. Patrick Magill, the chief restructuring officer appointed by the court to run the company during the bankruptcy. During Friday’s hearing, lawyers for the Sandy Hook families repeated claims that Jones illegally diverted millions of dollars both before and during the bankruptcies, and questioned his sending his audience to his father’s website. The families have a pending lawsuit in Texas accusing Jones of illegally diverting money, which he denies, and said they will continue efforts to claw it back. Jones and Free Speech Systems filed for bankruptcy protection in 2022, when relatives of many victims of the 2012 school shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut, won lawsuit judgments of more than $1.4 billion in Connecticut and $49 million in Texas. The relatives said they were traumatized by Jones’ comments and his followers’ actions. They have testified about being harassed and threatened by Jones’ believers, some of whom confronted the grieving families in person saying the shooting never happened and their children never existed. One parent said someone threatened to dig up his dead son’s grave. Jones is appealing the judgments in the state courts. The families in the Connecticut lawsuit, including relatives of eight dead children and adults, had asked that Free Speech Systems’ bankruptcy case also be converted to a liquidation. But the parents in the Texas suit — whose child, 6-year-old Jesse Lewis, died — wanted the company’s case dismissed, saying it would speed up collection of Jones’ debt to them. Lawyers for the company filed documents indicating it supported liquidation, but attorneys for Jones’ personal bankruptcy case wanted the judge to dismiss the company’s case.",

                    "title": "Judge Dismisses Bankruptcy Plan for Alex Jones’ Company, Personal Assets to Be Sold",
                    "text": "U.S. District Judge Christopher Lopez on Friday dismissed the proposed liquidation of Alex Jones’ company, Free Speech Systems, the parent company of InfoWars. The Texas bankruptcy judge deemed the denial of the bankruptcy plan as being in the best interest of the creditors. Judge Lopez’s ruling stands in contrast to an earlier decision where he approved the liquidation of Mr. Jones’ personal assets. “The right call is to dismiss this case,” Judge Lopez said in a detailed decision from the bench. “I think it needed to happen. I wish I would’ve picked a better day,” he added, referencing the proximity of his decision to Father’s Day. The judgment provides a nuanced outcome for both Mr. Jones and some of the Sandy Hook families involved in the litigation. It underscores a divide among the families: those involved in the Texas lawsuit supported the decision, as it allows them to pursue financial claims sooner, while those involved in the Connecticut lawsuit preferred a resolution that would have shut down InfoWars, even if it meant settling for less money. The ruling enables Mr. Jones to continue broadcasting on InfoWars while the families pursue the substantial defamation damages awarded to them. Attorney Chris Mattei, representing the families, declared it “a good day,” saying in a media statement: “Alex Jones has lost ownership of InfoWars, the corrupt business he has used for years to attack the Connecticut families and so many others. The Court authorized us to move immediately to collect against all InfoWars assets, and we intend to do exactly that.” Mr. Lopez said that the case is far from over, with decisions regarding the future of InfoWars now lying in the hands of the interim and permanent trustees in Mr. Jones’ personal case. “Those trustees will make decisions about where things go,” he said. “We’re not leaving things into the wind here.” As a result of the ruling, many of Mr. Jones’s personal assets will be sold off. However, his primary home in the Austin area and some other belongings are exempt from bankruptcy liquidation. Mr. Jones has already begun selling assets, including a Texas ranch valued at about $2.8 million and a gun collection, to help pay off his debts. Mr. Jones and Free Speech Systems filed for bankruptcy protection in 2022 after relatives of many victims of the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, won lawsuit judgments of more than $1.4 billion in Connecticut and $49 million in Texas against Mr. Jones and his company. These judgments are far more than the less than $5 million that, according to court documents, Mr. Jones’ personal assets are valued at. Prior to the judge’s ruling on Friday, Mr. Jones told reporters outside the courthouse that it’s “probably the end of InfoWars here very, very soon,” but he framed it as the “beginning of my fight against tyranny.” He said, “I didn’t kill those kids,” referring to the mass shooting by Adam Lanza. “I barely ever talked about them, I covered the internet questioning the shooting,” he said. “Now they are literally trying to take over my social media.” The families of several Sandy Hook victims had sued Mr. Jones and won the Texas and Connecticut trials, arguing that his remarks and claims made by his viewers traumatized them. During the trials, the families testified about being harassed and targeted by his followers, who claimed the shooting never occurred. Mr. Jones has maintained that he should not have to pay the families, although he testified in 2022 that his comments about the shooting were “absolutely irresponsible” and acknowledged that the shooting was real. He has argued that the lawsuit against him was an attempt to silence him and violated his constitutional rights. The Epoch Times contacted Mr. Mattei, an attorney for the families in the Connecticut case, for comment on June 14.",

                    "text": "Bombastic conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has been ordered to liquidate his personal assets as he owes $1.5 billion for his false claims that the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax. But the immediate future of his Infowars media platform, and the money behind the business that enriched Jones and connected him to far-right figures, celebrities and politicians, remain uncertain. The federal bankruptcy judge who ordered the asset liquidation Friday also dismissed a separate bankruptcy case involving Infowars parent company Free Speech Systems. Before the hearing a combative Jones predicted the end of Infowars could be “very soon,” and the website breathlessly warned that day could be its last broadcast. But he was smiling as he left hours later, calling in to an Infowars show to say, “The bizarre political attempts to hijack the operation have failed.” The fight over Jones’ assets reached this point after he and Free Speech Systems filed for bankruptcy protection in 2022. That came as relatives of many victims of the Sandy Hook shooting won defamation lawsuit judgments of more than $1.4 billion in Connecticut and $49 million in Texas. Here are some things to know about Jones and Sandy Hook families’ efforts to force him to pay: Who is Alex Jones and what is Infowars? Jones, a barrel-chested, gravelly voiced Texas native, has spouted conspiracy theories that range from the Sept. 11 terror attacks being staged to a purported U.N. effort regarding world depopulation. Jones had just finished high school in Austin when he started broadcasting on a public-access television channel in the 1990s. After getting fired from a local radio station, he began broadcasting from home via his Infowars website. Jones still hosts a daily four-hour talk show on the site. Interview guests this week included former Fox News star Tucker Carlson and British actor Russell Brand. From just two employees in 2004, Jones grew his business into a media empire that had a 60-person staff by 2010. Court records show his company has four Austin studios and a warehouse for products he sells online, such as dietary supplements with names like Infowars Life Brain Force Plus and Life Super Male Vitality. Much of his revenue came from those sales. But both Jones and lawyers for the Sandy Hook families said they expect Infowars to cease operations at some point because of the huge debt he now owes them. The tie to Sandy Hook The shooting had barely happened when Jones began pushing the falsehood that it was a hoax. Victims’ families who sued Jones said they were subjected to years of torment, threats and abuse by people who believed the lies told on his show. One father said conspiracy theorists urinated on his 7-year-old son’s grave and threatened to dig up the coffin. The families fought back with the lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas. Testifying in the Texas case, Jones acknowledged in 2022 that the shooting was “100 percent real” and that it was “absolutely irresponsible” to call it a hoax. How much money does Jones have? Jones has about $9 million in personal assets including his house, according to court filings in his bankruptcy case, and Friday’s ruling means much of that is to be sold off. But his $2.6 million primary home in the Austin area and some other belongings are protected from bankruptcy liquidation. He has already moved to sell his Texas ranch, which is worth about $2.8 million, along with a gun collection and other assets. The families have a pending lawsuit in Texas accusing Jones of illegally diverting and hiding millions of dollars. He has denied the allegations. What happens next? It is not immediately clear what will happen to Free Speech Systems and Infowars. Many of the Sandy Hook families had asked that the company also be liquidated. About the only certainty is more legal fighting. Lawyers involved in the case noted at least two possible scenarios. One would be for Infowars and Free Speech Systems to keep operating while efforts to collect on the $1.5 billion debt are made in state courts in Texas and Connecticut. Or Sandy Hook families could go back to the bankruptcy court and ask the judge to liquidate the company as part of Jones’ personal case because he owns the business. A trustee appointed Friday in Jones’ bankruptcy case now has control over his assets, including Infowars, according to lawyers for the families. One of them, Chris Mattei, called Infowars “soon-to-be defunct” on Friday. “Today is a good day,” Mattei said in a text message. “Alex Jones has lost ownership of Infowars, the corrupt business he has used for years to attack the Connecticut families and so many others.” Jones seemed pleased to still be operating for now. “Of the two bad outcomes, this is the one that’s way better,” Jones said. “I have not given up. I’m fighting.”",

                    "title": "Alex Jones’ personal assets to be sold to pay $1.5B Sandy Hook debt. Company bankruptcy is dismissed",
                    "text": "HOUSTON (AP) — A federal judge on Friday ordered the liquidation of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones′ personal assets but dismissed his company’s separate bankruptcy case, leaving the immediate future of his Infowars media platform uncertain as he owes $1.5 billion for his false claims that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. Judge Christopher Lopez approved converting Jones’ proposed personal bankruptcy reorganization to a liquidation. But Lopez threw out the case of his company, Austin, Texas-based Free Speech Systems, after failed attempts by Jones to reach an agreement with Sandy Hook families on his proposals to reorganize and keep operating the company while paying them millions of dollars. It wasn’t immediately clear what will happen in the coming weeks to Free Speech Systems, Infowars’ parent company, which Jones built into a multimillion-dollar moneymaker over the past 25 years by selling dietary supplements and other products. But both Jones and lawyers for the Sandy Hook families said they expect Infowars to cease operating at some point because of the huge debt. A trustee appointed Friday in Jones' personal bankruptcy case to oversee the liquidation now has control over his assets, including Infowars, according to lawyers for Sandy Hook families. Dismissal of Free Speech Systems' case means the families can now move immediately to collect on the $1.5 billion in state courts in Texas and Connecticut where they won defamation lawsuits against Jones and the company. It's possible Infowars will continue operating during the collection efforts, which could include selling off the company's assets. Jones, who smiled as the judge dismissed the company's case, called in to Infowars after the court hearing and predicted more battles in the state courts. “The bizarre political attempts to hijack the operation have failed,” he said, and added that he would find another way to broadcast his shows if he loses Infowars. Outside the courthouse, he railed about the families not accepting his reorganization proposals and alleged that they were being used by political groups in a conspiracy to silence him. He said he would try to maximize revenues at Infowars to make money for creditors and then wind down the business in a way that takes care of its 44 employees. “This is about taking me off the air,” Jones said. “Understand that what you’ve seen in the corporate media about me, or what I said about Sandy Hook or any of this, has no bearing on reality.” Chris Mattei, a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families, called Infowars “soon-to-be defunct” as his clients move to collect on the debt in state courts. He said the families will also pursue Jones' future earnings. “Today is a good day,” Mattei said in a text message after the hearing. “Alex Jones has lost ownership of Infowars, the corrupt business he has used for years to attack the Connecticut families and so many others. ... Alex Jones is neither a martyr nor a victim. He is the perpetrator of the worst defamation in American history.” Lopez had been asked to either convert Free Speech Systems' bankruptcy reorganization to a liquidation or dismiss the case. He said his sole focus was what would be best for the company and its creditors. He also said Free Speech Systems’ case appeared to be one of the longest running of its kind in the country, and it was approaching a deadline to resolve it. “I was never asked today to make a decision to shut down a show or not. That was never going to happen today one way or another,” Lopez said. “This case is one of the more difficult cases I’ve had. When you look at it, I think creditors are better served in pursuing their state court rights.” Many of Jones’ personal assets will be sold off, but his primary home in the Austin area and some other belongings are exempt from bankruptcy liquidation. He already has moved to sell his Texas ranch worth about $2.8 million, a gun collection and other assets to pay debts. In the lead-up to Friday’s hearing, Jones had been telling his web viewers and radio listeners that Free Speech Systems was on the verge of being shut down because of the bankruptcy. He urged them to download videos from his online archive to preserve them and pointed them to a new website of his father’s company if they want to continue buying the dietary supplements he sells on his show. Jones has about $9 million in personal assets, according to the most recent financial filings in court. Free Speech Systems has about $6 million in cash on hand and about $1.2 million worth of inventory, according to J. Patrick Magill, the chief restructuring officer appointed by the court to run the company during the bankruptcy. During Friday's hearing, lawyers for the Sandy Hook families repeated claims that Jones illegally diverted millions of dollars both before and during the bankruptcies, and questioned his sending his audience to his father's website. The families have a pending lawsuit in Texas accusing Jones of illegally diverting money, which he denies, and said they will continue efforts to claw it back. Jones and Free Speech Systems filed for bankruptcy protection in 2022, when relatives of many victims of the 2012 school shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut, won lawsuit judgments of more than $1.4 billion in Connecticut and $49 million in Texas. The relatives said they were traumatized by Jones’ comments and his followers' actions. They have testified about being harassed and threatened by Jones’ believers, some of whom confronted the grieving families in person saying the shooting never happened and their children never existed. One parent said someone threatened to dig up his dead son's grave. Jones is appealing the judgments in the state courts. The families in the Connecticut lawsuit, including relatives of eight dead children and adults, had asked that Free Speech Systems' bankruptcy case also be converted to a liquidation. But the parents in the Texas suit — whose child, 6-year-old Jesse Lewis, died — wanted the company's case dismissed, saying it would speed up collection of Jones' debt to them. Lawyers for the company filed documents indicating it supported liquidation, but attorneys for Jones' personal bankruptcy case wanted the judge to dismiss the company's case. ___ Collins reported from Hartford, Connecticut.",

                    "text": "On the island of Amorgos, a US tourist went missing while hiking alone. Greek authorities are currently looking for him. Albert Calibet, 59, disappeared on Tuesday afternoon, according to local authorities. When he didn’t come back from his hike, his companion reported him missing. According to Greek public broadcaster ERT News, several agencies are taking part in the search for Mr Calibet, including teams from the nearby islands of Paros and Naxos and volunteers from the coastguard. Michael Mosley, a British television presenter, vanished on the Greek island of Symi a few days prior, and his body wasn’t discovered until four days later.The US State Department has been contacted by the BBC to provide comments regarding the Mr. Calibet search.Nearly 25% of Amorgos is under search by land and sea, according to the island’s mayor Eleftherios Karaiskos, who spoke with ERT.In addition to searching the northern portion of the island using a drone, they are trying to locate Mr. Calibet’s two cell phones. There have been no responses to calls made to Mr Calibet, who the mayor claimed had previously been to the island. “We’re almost on three days here,” his brother Oliver Calibet told Fox 11 TV in Los Angeles. “There’s no water… I’m very distraught.” According to ABC News, Oliver Calibet and Mr Calibet’s girlfriend are travelling to Greece to assist with the hunt. The trek Mr. Calibet had started was busy and not very difficult, according to the mayor of the island, raising the possibility that the American had strayed from his intended path. Local news sources state that Mr. Calibet, a Los Angeles County retired police officer, began a climb in the village of Aegiali on Tuesday morning. It is believed that he texted a picture of the sign directing him to Katapola, which is around four hours away by foot, a few minutes later. A local woman claimed to have spoken with the missing tourist approximately two hours after he made a purchase of drinks at a nearby business. Mega TV was informed by Sofia Liviaki that Mr Calibet had consumed a soft drink, given her a map of his intended route, and brought a bottle of water for the duration of his trip. The local population of Amorgos, where Mr. Calibet had been a frequent guest for several years, was taken aback by his departure. Although the route he selected is well-trod and not very challenging, the island has been hit by a heatwave, with highs of up to 35C (95F). “Temperatures are very high, like all of Greece during the heatwave,” the island’s deputy mayor for tourism, Popi Despotidi, told Greek media. “We’re guessing he felt dizzy… and collapsed somewhere. It’s odd because he’s not someone who was walking this route for the first time.” “We hope that we can bring him home safely,” Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna told ABC News. “We are actively collaborating with multiple agencies abroad to assist in the search for Deputy Calibet and will use every resource we have available to bring him back to those who love him.” The missing man’s search comes days after authorities searched Symi, another Greek island, for days in an attempt to find Dr Mosley, a well-known British TV doctor who disappeared after going for a stroll along the beach. Investigators determined that he died on the day he vanished due to natural causes when his body was discovered in a rocky region.",

                    "text": "ATHENS, Greece — A missing Dutch tourist was found dead early Saturday on the eastern Greek island of Samos, local media reported, the latest in a string of recent cases in which tourists in the Greek islands have died or gone missing. Some, if not all, had set out on hikes in blistering hot temperatures. Dr. Michael Mosley, a noted British TV anchor and author, was found dead last Sunday on the island of Symi. A coroner concluded that he had died the previous Wednesday, shortly after going for a hike over difficult, rocky terrain. Samos, like Symi, lies very close to the Turkish coast. The body of the 74-year-old Dutch tourist was found by a Fire Service drone lying face down in a ravine about 300 meters (330 yards) from the spot where he was last observed on Sunday, walking with some difficulty in the blistering heat. Authorities were still searching for four people reported missing in the past few days. On Friday, two French tourists were reported missing on Sikinos, a relatively secluded Cyclades island in the Aegean Sea, with less than 400 permanent residents. The two women, aged 73 and 64, had left their respective hotels to meet. A 70-year-old American tourist was reported missing Thursday on the small island of Mathraki in Greece’s northwest extremity by his host, a Greek-American friend. The tourist had last been seen Tuesday at a cafe in the company of two female tourists who have since left the island. Mathraki, population 100, is a 1.2-square-mile heavily wooded island, west of the better-known island of Corfu. Strong winds had prevented police and the fire service from reaching the island to search for the missing person as of Saturday afternoon, media reported. On the island of Amorgos, authorities were still searching for a 59-year-old tourist reported missing since Tuesday, when he had gone on a solo hike in very hot conditions. U.S. media identified the missing tourist as retired Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Albert Calibet of Hermosa Beach, California. Amorgos, the easternmost of the Cyclades islands, is a rocky 47-square-mile island of less than 2,000 inhabitants. A couple of years ago the island had a record number of visitors, over 100,000. Some media commentary has focused on the need to inform tourists of the dangers of setting off on hikes in intense heat. Temperatures across Greece on Saturday were more than 18 Fahrenheit lower than on Thursday, when they peaked at almost 45 C (113 F). They are expected to rise again from Sunday, although not to heat-wave levels. Comments are not available on this story. « Previous",

They signal when necessary and use lead conventions such as “fourth highest.” But a defender need not do anything for declarer’s benefit. Today’s West led a fourth-highest five of spades against 3NT. (West might have bid two spades over South’s 1NT.) East took the king and returned the deuce … and instead of winning and leading a third spade, West followed with the six, as if he had led from a four-card suit. DOWN TWO South then thought it safe to force out the ace of hearts; he would lose two more spades but would have nine winners. West won and ran his spades for down two. If West clears the spades, South will be afraid to attack the hearts. He will finesse in diamonds, winning four diamonds, four clubs and a spade. West could afford to deceive his partner in this deal. He knew that East could have no more honors and would play no further part in the defense. DAILY QUESTION You hold: S J 10 H J 10 6 D A 10 9 4 C K J 10 5. Your partner opens one spade, you respond two clubs, he bids two hearts and you try 2NT. Partner then bids three spades. What do you say? ANSWER: Partner’s bidding suggests six spades, four hearts and extra strength. With a minimum hand, most experts would have rebid two spades to limit the strength.

                    "text": "Satellite internet is the one broadband connection type currently available to people in the rural areas of all 50 states. Serving as a solid alternative for those without access to DSL, cable or fiber internet, satellite internet involves linking a home internet modem to a satellite in space. No, it doesn't match the internet speed capabilities of fiber or cable connections. Still, satellite broadband can play a key role when internet access is vital (and the pandemic shed light on just how critical it is). Which of the satellite internet providers is best? What is the best satellite internet? Frankly, there aren't a lot of choices out there for satellite internet. Based on our analysis, we've deemed that Starlink boasts the greatest potential, Hughesnet features the most reliable speeds and Viasat's new unlimited data plan could be very attractive to customers. We know that many people in rural America lack adequate internet access. To ensure you’re getting the best broadband experience possible, we’ve carefully examined the available options, considering speeds, pricing, customer service and overall value to put together your top internet options. Here’s a quick look at how the best satellite internet providers compare. Read more: Could 5G Home Internet Be the Answer to Your Broadband Needs? Source: CNET analysis of provider data. Best satellite internet service providers Source: CNET analysis of provider data. Source: CNET analysis of provider data. Source: CNET analysis of provider data. How we test satellite internet providers Internet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it’s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What’s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information, drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov. It doesn't end there: We go to the FCC's website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication. Once we have this localized information, we ask three main questions: Does the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds?Do customers get decent value for what they’re paying?Are customers happy with their service? The answer to those questions is often layered and complex, but the providers who come closest to “yes” on all three are the ones we recommend. To explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page. How to choose a satellite internet provider Finding the right ISP for your household is not easy. This is especially true if you live in a rural or underserved portion of the US. We recommend carefully considering your household's activities so you can better determine the download and upload speeds necessary to meet your needs. With that knowledge, you can better tackle plan pricing that will fit your budget and broadband demands. For more thorough tips on finding the top internet plan for your household, check out CNET's 10 tips to help you get the most out of your internet service. What's next for satellite internet providers? Stay tuned to CNET for the latest developments with Starlink as it presses further into its plans and aims to expand its coverage. Just recently, Starlink announced that it's been working towards reducing median latency for customers nationwide. According to Ookla speed test data from Q3 of 2023, the latest available, Starlink's median download speed in the US was 64.54Mbps, which was a 13Mbps increase early last year. Viasat was in distant second place with 34.72Mbps download speeds and Hughesnet was in the rear at 15.87Mbps. Ookla's report mentions that Starlink users highly recommend the service and are happy with its internet connectivity. It’s safe to say that it's beginning to change expectations of how satellite internet can perform. It should also be mentioned that further disruption may come from another multibillionaire, Jeff Bezos, as Amazon's Project Kuiper also aims to enter the field. While nowhere near the stage that Starlink has achieved thus far, Project Kuiper did turn some heads when its recent optical mesh network test in space showed possible reduced latency for customers. Innovations from low-Earth-orbit satellites will be just one piece of the puzzle of better delivering the internet to the millions of households still unable to find a reliable broadband source. We'll keep this post updated as your options (hopefully) improve. Are there any alternative connection types besides satellite internet? Yes. Many broadband connection options may offer faster (and possibly cheaper) service than satellite internet. Cable Cable internet provides connection through the same cables (often a hybrid fiber and copper line) that providers use to provide TV services. It's more reliable than satellite internet and offers faster download speeds. Most of the time, cable internet is bundled with TV to lure consumers into buying higher-priced packages. Companies like Cox, Spectrum and Xfinity offer cable internet. DSL DSL, or digital subscriber line, uses telephone lines to connect users. Companies like AT&T, CenturyLink and Frontier offer DSL Internet. The good news is those copper lines are prevalent across the country. The not-so-good news is that download speeds typically fall short of what cable internet offers. In some cases, your speeds might even be slower than satellite internet. Fixed wireless/5G home internet 5G home internet and fixed wireless go hand-in-hand: 5G home internet services are fixed wireless internet services. Not all fixed wireless services are 5G home internet offerings. Are you confused yet? Fixed wireless service means the connection between your provider and home is not wired. That fixed wireless connection can come via cellular networks (including 3G, 4G, 4G LTE and 5G) and by satellite. Fixed wireless networks tend to be slower and more laggy than wired connections. The promise of 5G home internet -- from Starry, T-Mobile Home Internet and Verizon 5G Home Internet -- is speeds that compare favorably to cable connections. Fiber Fiber internet is the gold standard of the broadband world. Often referred to as \"future proof,\" fiber internet offers some of the fastest plans available and features symmetrical download and upload speeds. It's more reliable than cable and is less prone to being affected by peak usage times or congestion. Companies like AT&T, Google Fiber and Verizon Fios offer fiber-optic internet. Mobile hotspots While mobile hotspots also use cellular networks, similar to fixed wireless internet, they are not \"fixed.\" You can use a hotspot at multiple locations and they aren't dependent on your home address. Despite the wide range of options available, each connection type varies in terms of availability, pricing and speeds. Make sure to research and compare the different options to ensure you choose the one that best meets your needs and budget. Satellite internet FAQs",

                    "text": "I fondly remember summers in Montana, fishing with my grandparents and watching deer stroll through the yard. My grandparents didn’t have internet at their home in Libby, but times have changed. If they lived there today, they would probably have fiber internet from Ziply. Libby is one of the lucky locales in the Treasure State with fiber access. Most Montanans work with cable, DSL, fixed wireless or satellite internet. Montana does not have a great reputation for fast, reliable and affordable internet. Ookla’s Speedtest data ranks it way down in 50th place among the states (and Washington, D.C.), with only Wyoming behind Montana. However, most city dwellers can still access decent broadband speeds. What is the best internet provider in Montana? Spectrum is CNET's top pick for Montana's best internet service provider. The cable provider delivers gig-level broadband to many of the population centers in Montana. CNET examines customer service, speed, pricing and overall value before recommending the best broadband in your area. Spectrum is joined by other recommendations, including CenturyLink for availability and TDS Telecom as an ISP to watch. Whether you're moving to Montana or looking to upgrade your current broadband situation, this guide will help you navigate your ISP options. Best internet options in Montana Source: CNET analysis of provider data. People who live in rural homes, ranches and farms need decent internet for work and play. That can be a challenge in some parts of Montana. Satellite internet from Starlink, Viasat or Hughesnet is a fallback, but it tends to be expensive, and speeds may be less than desirable. When it comes to wired internet, your best bet will likely be CenturyLink DSL, which often has a wider coverage area than most other alternatives. Speeds can be extremely variable by location and max out at 100Mbps. Montana is dotted with local ISPs that offer fixed wireless for rural locations, sometimes paired with a smaller fiber footprint. Our chart covers some options available across the state, but there are more than we’ve listed here. Fixed wireless speeds can vary based on location. You’ll need a good line of sight to a tower. Here’s how fixed wireless compares to other types of internet connections. Most fixed wireless ISPs have fairly standard plans with pricing based on speed. The Missoula Vallery Internet Co-op is an exception. It charges based on usage. Montana could use some improvement in rural broadband options. The state is well aware of the issue and is in the process of pouring funding into improving access to more remote communities as well as ranches and farms. Internet breakdown by city in Montana It’s hard to cover the broadband options of an entire state and give individual cities the attention they deserve. That’s why we also compile lists of the best internet providers in cities across the US, including those in Montana. We tackle details such as internet connection types, maximum speeds, cheapest providers and more. Check back later if you don’t find the city you’re looking for below. We’re working to add more locations every week. Best internet providers in BillingsBest internet providers in BozemanBest internet providers in HelenaBest internet providers in Missoula Montana broadband at a glance The FCC National Broadband Map shows all Montana households can access broadband internet, but that doesn’t give a complete picture of the internet scene in the Treasure State. The FCC defines broadband as at least 25Mbps down and 3Mbps up, and it includes satellite internet in its estimate. Satellite internet can be expensive and slow and is not necessarily a good fit for all rural locations. The state government says 5% of Montanans live in underserved areas and 13% live in unserved areas. FCC data shows less than 20% of Montana households can access fiber internet, and if we’re talking at least gigabit speeds, that number drops to 16%. Not surprisingly, you’re most likely to find fiber in bigger cities, but even then, it’s a bit scattershot. There are some exceptions. Libby, a town of less than 3,000 residents, is covered by Ziply Fiber. If fiber is important to you for remote work or gaming, that narrows your options for places to live in Montana. If you can get by with gig downloads and 35Mbps uploads, Spectrum covers much more ground. Montana broadband speeds Montana's poor showing in Ookla's state speed test rankings indicates the challenges involved with rural broadband in the state. It's also tied to a lack of fiber offerings and ISP competition in the cities. Regarding gig speeds, FCC data shows only 16% of Montana homes are covered. Ookla highlights Spectrum as Montana's fastest provider, with a median download speed of 216Mbps. The downside of cable is that you're stuck with slower upload speeds. For symmetrical speeds, you need to turn to fiber. Montana includes some coverage from Quantum Fiber, Ziply Fiber, TDS Telecom or local ISPs like Montana Internet and Grizzly Broadband. If you're currently battling pokey internet speeds, there are some things you can try to improve your situation. Check out these four essential steps for speeding up your internet connection. Internet pricing in Montana Home internet pricing is variable in Montana. On the low end, you can bundle an eligible T-Mobile phone plan with an internet plan to bring your internet price down to $40 monthly. Most ISPs start at the $50 and above level. That includes CenturyLink's DSL networks and Quantum Fiber's lowest tier, with the fiber plan being a superior deal for 500Mbps service. Availability is a big issue. You can always try to negotiate back to a better deal. The future of broadband in Montana Since Montana is already near the bottom in internet speed for the US, there’s nowhere to go but up. Fortunately, there’s some movement in that direction, particularly regarding fiber availability. TDS Telecom announced in early 2023 that it would bring fiber speeds of up to 8 gigs to Helena, Butte, Missoula and Great Falls. It was already working on fiber in Billings. By the time TDS is done, it will service 150,000 homes and businesses. A considerable amount of funding is coming to expand broadband to underserved and unserved areas of the state. The federal Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program is delivering $630 million in funding. That’s in addition to a $309 million infrastructure investment announced by Governor Greg Gianforte in late 2022. That money aims to bring reliable broadband to 62,000 homes, small businesses, farms and ranches. Internet in Montana FAQs",

All available Des Moines residential internet providers The list above notes the top available internet providers in Des Moines. You have a few other choices in this area, though you will need to check with the provider to see if it is available at your address. CenturyLink: Also known as Quantum Fiber in some areas, CenturyLink has fiber and DSL options. The fiber internet service is the highlight because it goes up to 940Mbps at a reasonable $75 a month. There is unlimited data, no annual contract and the modem is provided on the gigabit fiber plan. Rise Broadband: This fixed wireless option starts at $35 a month. Though most plans have a data cap of 250GB, it also has unlimited data options. There's no term contract required for service. Satellite internet: This internet connection type offers slower speeds, often at higher prices, so it tends to be a better pick for rural areas that don't have other options. HughesNet gets the first mention in the Des Moines area due to its lower starting price. Viasat is also in the mix, with a starting price of around $70 per month but a higher data allowance. Starlink is a newer player in the satellite internet space and is a bit more intriguing with faster speeds and no contracts. However, a steep upfront cost of nearly $600 for equipment is enough to make one pause.UScellular: Another fixed wireless option, plans are $50 a month with AutoPay and paperless billing. There is a promotion for $30 monthly when you pair home internet with a new mobile service. Verizon 5G Home Internet: Verizon has a fixed wireless home internet option. It runs $50 a month for speeds of 85 to 300Mbps and $70 monthly for 300 to 1,000Mbps. Both plans have no equipment fees, data caps or contracts. Plus, Verizon Wireless customers can get 50% off the monthly price when home internet is bundled with select mobile plans. Pricing info on Des Moines home internet service Of the cities CNET has covered for broadband, starting prices are between $36 and $50, give or take. The average starting price for Des Moines is approximately $44, which is not as low as Brooklyn ($36 per month), Los Angeles ($38 monthly) or Denver ($39 a month), but also not up in the range of Charlotte, Las Vegas or St. Louis (all around $50 a month). Cheap internet options in the Des Moines metro area The lowest starting price in Des Moines is $15 a month through Mediacom for its Xstream Connect 100Mbps plan. CenturyLink offers a 100Mbps plan for just a bit more at $55 a month. Mediacom is the better value overall currently. Fastest internet providers in Des Moines You can find several Des Moines internet providers that offer gigabit speeds or more. That includes CenturyLink, Mediacom and Metronet. That said, according to Ookla data from February 2024, the median download speed for Des Moines is just over 265Mbps, which would put the city somwehere in the top 15 cities in the US. You have a decent number of high-speed internet options in Des Moines. Metronet goes up to 5 gigs, while CenturyLink and Mediacom go up to 1 gig. To see how this compares to providers in other cities, check out our guide on the best multi-gig internet plans. What's the final word on internet providers in Des Moines? You have several options if you want 1 gig or higher speeds. In general, plans from the ISPs are also customizable to fit a wide range of budgets. Metronet is your answer if you're looking for symmetrical download and upload speed, along with some multi-gigabit speeds. But for midrange speeds at decent starting prices, the cable internet of Mediacom will meet most households' needs. How CNET chose the best internet providers in Des Moines Internet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it’s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. So what’s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov. But it doesn’t end there. We go to the FCC’s website to check our data and ensure we’re considering every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. To evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service, we look at sources including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of the time of publication. Once we have this localized information, we ask three main questions: Does the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they're paying? Are customers happy with their service? While the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to “yes” on all three are the ones we recommend.

Living in Hawaii involves sacrificing some things you'd find on the mainland; snakes, daylight-saving time and billboards for example. Fortunately, high-speed internet isn't one of them. Gig speeds from Spectrum, CNET's pick for the best internet provider in Hawaii overall, are available throughout much of Hawaii from the Big Island to Kauai. Spectrum also offers a variety of speeds and simple service details, which include unlimited data and a free modem with all plans. Hawaiian Telcom is another option, which uses a fiber-optic network to deliver speeds as fast as or faster than Spectrum. T-Mobile's $60-per-month 5G home internet service is another decent broadband alternative, and its wireless delivery may help fill in the gaps that other internet service providers don't reach. Spectrum, Hawaiian Telecom and Verizon all offer blazing-fast plans up to 1,000Mbps with no data caps or required contracts. If you're looking to save money on the internet, Hawaiian Telecom's 400Mbps plan costs only $40 per month, which is $10 cheaper than the average home broadband price in Hawaii. Best internet in Hawaii in 2024 Source: CNET analysis of provider data. Internet breakdown by city in Hawaii It’s hard to cover the broadband options of a state like Hawaii and give individual cities the attention they deserve. That’s why we also compile lists of the best internet providers in cities across the US, including those in Hawaii. We tackle details such as internet connection types, maximum speeds, cheapest providers and more. Check back later if you don’t find the city you’re looking for below. We’re working to add more locations every week. Best internet providers in Honolulu Cheap internet options in Hawaii Unless you qualify for the T-Mobile or Verizon 5G discounts, Hawaiian Telcom has the cheapest starting price for internet in Hawaii at around $40 per month for speeds up to 400Mbps. Spectrum is $10 more monthly for the same download speed potential but has a lower equipment rental fee than Hawaiian Telcom. Source: CNET analysis of provider data. How to find internet deals and promotions in Hawaii The best internet deals and top promotions in Hawaii depend on what discounts are available during that time. Most deals are short-lived, but we look frequently for the latest offers. Hawaii internet providers, such as Spectrum and Viasat, may offer lower introductory pricing or streaming add-ons for a limited time. Many, including Verizon, run the same standard pricing year-round. For a more extensive list of promos, check out our guide on the best internet deals. Fastest internet plans in Hawaii The FCC reports that 100% of households in Hawaii are eligible for broadband speeds of at least 25Mbps down and 3Mbps up. The most recent Ookla speed test data ranks Hawaii's average download speeds 13th among all states (and Washington, D.C.) at about 226Mbps. Spectrum, Hawaiian Telcom and Verizon 5G Home will be your best bets for those speeds and higher. Regarding speed potential and reliability, I'd prefer a fiber-optic connection like the one you get with Hawaiian Telcom over a cable one from Spectrum. Fiber internet is equipped to support much faster upload speeds and is less susceptible to speed fluctuations during peak usage times. Source: CNET analysis of provider data. What’s a good internet speed? Most internet connection plans can now handle basic productivity and communication tasks. If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address. For more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need. 0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics: browsing the internet, sending and receiving email and streaming low-quality video.5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.40 to 100Mbps should give one user sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming. 100 to 500Mbps allows one to two users to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming. 500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more users to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time. How CNET chose the best internet providers in Hawaii Internet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it's impractical to personally test every internet service provider in a given city. What's our approach? For starters, we tap into a proprietary database of pricing, availability and speed information that draws from our own historical ISP data, partner data and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov. It doesn’t end there: We go to the FCC’s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D.

When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. To explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page. What’s the final word on internet providers in Hawaii? Although some amenities are less accessible or affordable in Hawaii than in other parts of the US, broadband connectivity and pricing are as good in Hawaii as anywhere. Spectrum is the best high-speed internet source throughout much of Hawaii, but Hawaiian Telcom's fiber service could be the better value if available at your address. If neither offers service where you live, T-Mobile Home Internet is a decent option for low-hassle broadband. And as a last resort, satellite provider Viasat is available throughout the Aloha State.

                    "text": "PARIS — Water in the Seine River had unsafe elevated levels of E. coli less than two months before swimming competitions are scheduled to take place in it during the Paris Olympics, according to test results published Friday. Contamination levels in the first eight days of June, after persistent heavy rain in Paris, showed bacteria such as E. coli and enterococci beyond limits judged safe for athletes. The report was published by monitoring group Eau de Paris one day after a senior International Olympic Committee executive said there were “no reasons to doubt” races will go ahead as scheduled in a historic downtown stretch of the Seine near the Eiffel Tower. The first Olympic event in the cleaned-up Seine is men’s triathlon, including a 1.5-kilometer (under 1 mile) swim, on the morning of July 30. The women’s triathlon is the next day and a mixed relay event is on Aug. 5. Marathon swimming races over 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) for women and men are scheduled on Aug. 8 and 9, respectively, in waters that were historically polluted before a $1.5 billion investment ahead of the Olympics “We are confident that we will swim in the Seine this summer,” IOC official Christophe Dubi said Thursday at an online briefing after hearing an update Paris from city officials and Olympic organizers. Despite the IOC’s publicly expressed confidence, the final decision on approving the events safe for athletes should rest with the governing bodies of individual sports, World Aquatics and World Triathlon. The safety of the Seine water for the Olympics has been in doubt since some test events scheduled last August were cancelled, also after unseasonal heavy rains. According to European standards, the safe limit for E. coli is 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters. The World Triathlon Federation uses the same criteria to determine sufficient water quality for competitions. During the first eight days of June, test results showed that E. coli levels frequently exceeded these thresholds. Enterococci levels were better, mostly staying within safe limits. The tests indicated an improvement, from high contamination levels on June 1 to more acceptable levels by June 9, mainly due to improved weather. Rainwater infiltrates the sewer system, and to prevent street flooding, the excess water, carrying fecal bacteria, is diverted into the Seine. To address this, a massive reservoir capable of storing 50,000 cubic meters of water during heavy rainfall was inaugurated in May. Water quality of rivers in major cities can be impacted by many things, from runoff to dumping of chemicals, sometimes illegally, and boat traffic. Earlier this week, Paris’ mayor Anne Hidalgo doubled down on her promise to take a dip in the river before the start of the competition. On Tuesday, she confirmed that her swim was postponed until after the snap elections in France, which end on July 7.",

                    "text": "DETROIT (AP) — Donald Trump will use back-to-back stops Saturday to court Black voters and a conservative group that has been accused of attracting white supremacists as the Republican presidential candidate works to stitch together a coalition of historically divergent interests in battleground Michigan. Trump is scheduled to host an afternoon roundtable at an African American church in downtown Detroit. Later he will appear at the “People’s Convention” of Turning Point Action, a group that the Anti-Defamation League says has been linked to a variety of extremists. Roughly 24 hours before Trump planned to address the conference, well-known white supremacist Nick Fuentes entered Turning Point’s convention hall surrounded by a group of cheering supporters. He was quickly escorted out by security. Fuentes created political problems for Trump after Fuentes attended a private lunch with the former president and the rapper formerly known as Kanye West at Trump’s Florida estate in 2022. Trump’s weekend plans underscore the evolving political forces shaping the presidential election this fall as he tries to deny Democratic President Joe Biden a second term. Few states are expected to matter more in November than Michigan, which Biden carried by less than 3 percentage points four years ago. And few voting groups matter more to Democrats than African Americans, who made up the backbone of Biden’s political base in 2020. But now, less than five months before Election Day, Black voters are expressing modest signs of disappointment with the 81-year-old Democrat. Michael Whatley, the new chairman of the Republican National Committee, told Michigan Republicans at a dinner Friday that the state could not be more important. “Everybody knows if we don’t win Michigan, we’re not going to have a Republican in the White House,” Whatley said. “Let me be more blunt: If we don’t win Michigan, we’re not going to have Donald Trump in the White House.” “We are going to determine the fate of the world in this election in November,” he added. Trump argues he can pull in more Black voters due to his economic and border security message, and that his felony indictments make him more relatable. Democrats are offering a competing perspective. “Donald Trump is so dangerous for Michigan and dangerous for America and dangerous for Black people,” Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, who is African American, said Friday. He said it was “offensive” for Trump to come. Among Black adults, Biden’s approval has dropped from 94% when he started his term in January 2021 to just 55%, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll published in March. About 8 in 10 Black voters have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, with roughly two-thirds saying they have a “very unfavorable” view of him, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in June. About 2 in 10 Black voters have a very or somewhat favorable view of Trump. Trump won 8% of the Black vote in 2020, according to AP VoteCast. And in what is expected to be a close election, even a modest shift could be consequential. Maurice Morrison, a 67-year-old lifelong Detroit resident, plans to attend Trump’s church appearance. Morrison acknowledged that Trump, for whom he voted twice before and plans to again, is deeply unpopular in his community and even inside his home. “Once he decided to run for president as a Republican, that automatically made him racist. That’s his middle name now — ‘Trump is racist’ — everybody I talk to, all the people I know, my family,” said Morrison, who is Black. “The man cares.” Meanwhile, thousands of conservative activists, most of them young and white, were eagerly awaiting Trump’s keynote address Saturday night. Turning Point has emerged as a force in GOP politics in the Trump era, particularly among his “Make America Great Again” movement, despite the ADL’s warning that the group “continues to attract racists.” “Numerous individuals associated with the group have made bigoted statements about the Black community, the LGBTQ community and other groups,” the ADL, an international anti-hate group, wrote in a background memo. “While TPUSA (Turning Point USA) leaders say they reject white supremacist ideology, known white nationalists have attended their events.” A Turning Point spokesperson did not respond to questions about the ADL’s characterization. Turning Point, long popular among Trump’s MAGA fringe, is now a central player in mainstream Republican politics. The group’s weekend speaking program featured a long list of established Republican politicians, including U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, in addition U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and former Trump counselor Steve Bannon, who is set to report to prison by July 1 to begin serving a four-month sentence for defying a U.S. House subpoena. In his remarks Friday night, Vivek Ramaswamy, who has emerged as a fierce Trump ally since unsuccessfully challenging Trump for the GOP presidential nomination, called on conservatives to reject what he said was the Democrats’ embrace of diversity. “I am sick and tired of celebrating our diversity,” Ramaswamy charged. “It means nothing unless there is something greater that unites us.” ___ Associated Press writer Linley Sanders in Washington contributed to this report.",

                    "text": "DETROIT — Donald Trump will use back-to-back stops Saturday to court Black voters and a conservative group that has been accused of attracting white supremacists as the Republican presidential candidate works to stitch together a coalition of historically divergent interests in battleground Michigan. Trump is scheduled to host an afternoon roundtable at an African American church in downtown Detroit. Later he will appear at the “People’s Convention” of Turning Point Action, a group that the Anti-Defamation League says has been linked to a variety of extremists. Roughly 24 hours before Trump planned to address the conference, well-known white supremacist Nick Fuentes entered Turning Point’s convention hall surrounded by a group of cheering supporters. He was quickly escorted out by security. Fuentes created political problems for Trump after Fuentes attended a private lunch with the former president and the rapper formerly known as Kanye West at Trump’s Florida estate in 2022. Trump’s weekend plans underscore the evolving political forces shaping the presidential election this fall as he tries to deny Democratic President Joe Biden a second term. Few states are expected to matter more in November than Michigan, which Biden carried by less than 3 percentage points four years ago. And few voting groups matter more to Democrats than African Americans, who made up the backbone of Biden’s political base in 2020. But now, less than five months before Election Day, Black voters are expressing modest signs of disappointment with the 81-year-old Democrat. PHOTOS: Trump's Michigan trip will include stops at a Black church and a gathering of far-right activists Michael Whatley, the new chairman of the Republican National Committee, told Michigan Republicans at a dinner Friday that the state could not be more important. “Everybody knows if we don’t win Michigan, we’re not going to have a Republican in the White House,” Whatley said. “Let me be more blunt: If we don’t win Michigan, we’re not going to have Donald Trump in the White House.” “We are going to determine the fate of the world in this election in November,” he added. Trump argues he can pull in more Black voters due to his economic and border security message, and that his felony indictments make him more relatable. Democrats are offering a competing perspective. “Donald Trump is so dangerous for Michigan and dangerous for America and dangerous for Black people,” Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, who is African American, said Friday. He said it was “offensive” for Trump to come. Among Black adults, Biden’s approval has dropped from 94% when he started his term in January 2021 to just 55%, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll published in March. About 8 in 10 Black voters have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, with roughly two-thirds saying they have a “very unfavorable” view of him, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in June. About 2 in 10 Black voters have a very or somewhat favorable view of Trump. Trump won 8% of the Black vote in 2020, according to AP VoteCast. And in what is expected to be a close election, even a modest shift could be consequential. Maurice Morrison, a 67-year-old lifelong Detroit resident, plans to attend Trump’s church appearance. Morrison acknowledged that Trump, for whom he voted twice before and plans to again, is deeply unpopular in his community and even inside his home. “Once he decided to run for president as a Republican, that automatically made him racist. That’s his middle name now - ‘Trump is racist’ - everybody I talk to, all the people I know, my family,” said Morrison, who is Black. “The man cares.” Meanwhile, thousands of conservative activists, most of them young and white, were eagerly awaiting Trump’s keynote address Saturday night. Turning Point has emerged as a force in GOP politics in the Trump era, particularly among his “Make America Great Again” movement, despite the ADL’s warning that the group “continues to attract racists.” “Numerous individuals associated with the group have made bigoted statements about the Black community, the LGBTQ community and other groups,” the ADL, an international anti-hate group, wrote in a background memo. “While TPUSA (Turning Point USA) leaders say they reject white supremacist ideology, known white nationalists have attended their events.” A Turning Point spokesperson did not respond to questions about the ADL’s characterization. Turning Point, long popular among Trump’s MAGA fringe, is now a central player in mainstream Republican politics. The group’s weekend speaking program featured a long list of established Republican politicians, including U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, in addition U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and former Trump counselor Steve Bannon, who is set to report to prison by July 1 to begin serving a four-month sentence for defying a U.S. House subpoena. In his remarks Friday night, Vivek Ramaswamy, who has emerged as a fierce Trump ally since unsuccessfully challenging Trump for the GOP presidential nomination, called on conservatives to reject what he said was the Democrats’ embrace of diversity. “I am sick and tired of celebrating our diversity,” Ramaswamy charged. “It means nothing unless there is something greater that unites us.”",

Garlin Gilchrist II, who is African American, said Friday. He said it was “offensive” for Trump to address the Turning Point conference, which was taking place at the same convention center that was “the epicenter of their steal the election effort.” Indeed, dozens of angry Trump loyalists chanting “Stop the count!” descended on the TCF Center, now named Huntington Place, the day after the 2020 presidential election as absentee ballots were being counted. Local media captured scenes of protesters outside and in the lobby. Police prevented them from entering the counting area. The protests took place after Trump had tweeted that “they are finding Biden votes all over” in several states, including Michigan. The false notion that Biden benefited from widespread voter fraud has been widely debunked by voting officials in both parties, the court system and members of Trump’s former administration. Still, Trump continues to promote such misinformation, which echoed throughout the conservative convention over the weekend. Speaking from the main stage, Turning Point founder and CEO Charlie Kirk falsely described the conference location as “the scene of a crime.” Such extreme rhetoric does not appear to have hurt Trump’s standing with Black voters, however. Among Black adults, Biden’s approval has dropped from 94% when he started his term in January 2021 to just 55%, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll published in March.

They’ve completely lost the plot,” Kolvet said, describing the ADL’s criticism as “a badge of honor.” Turning Point, long popular among Trump’s MAGA fringe, is now a central player in mainstream Republican politics.

                    "text": "By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer PINEHURST, N.C. — The U.S. Open is a new experience for Ludvig Aberg, not that anyone would notice the way his machine-like game gave him the 36-hole lead Friday. Pinehurst No. 2 is not. Aberg was a 19-year-old from Sweden about to start his college career at Texas Tech when he came to this Donald Ross gem for the 2019 U.S. Amateur, losing in the second round. “I remember it was one of my first experiences coming over and playing a really hard golf course in America,” Aberg said. “And I was like, ‘Is this what golf in America is like?’ Luckily it’s not like this every week. But I just remember it being very hard.” It remains every bit of that, and Aberg showed again that he very much up to the task. He didn’t miss a fairway until the eighth hole of the second round. The sensational Swede is not immune to mistakes, but he has avoided big blunders and big numbers. He methodically worked his way to a 1-under-par 69 in extreme heat. He took a one-shot lead into a weekend that features Bryson DeChambeau, Patrick Cantlay and Rory McIlroy in the mix, and Scottie Scheffler thankful just to make the cut and get another crack at Pinehurst. “It’s the first time I’ve ever played with him. The guy is like a machine from what I saw,” Tony Finau said after a 69 left him only two shots behind. “I obviously am focused on what I’m doing and playing my game, but he hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens. “He sure makes it look pretty easy.” Aberg wasn’t flawless. He did miss two fairways and he had two bogeys, one from the sandy landscape left of the eighth fairway, another when his approach on the 16th rolled through the green and into a back bunker. He was at 5-under 135 and led by one shot over DeChambeau (69), Cantlay (71) and Thomas Detry of Belgium (67). Pinehurst No. 2 is tough enough without a heat index that pushed toward 100 degrees at the peak of the afternoon, and with just enough wind to cause doubt. That’s just how the 24-year-old Swede likes it. “It’s not an easy golf course to play,” Aberg said. “But I felt like we stayed very disciplined, stayed very patient and tried to hit it to our targets all the time. We said beforehand, ‘See how many good shots we can hit today and see where that ends up.’” He wound up with another chance on a big stage. Just over a year after he graduated from Texas Tech, Aberg already is No. 6 in the world, has won on both sides of the Atlantic, played in a Ryder Cup and was runner-up in the Masters. Scheffler, coming off his fifth victory of the year last week at the Memorial. He went birdie-free for the first time in nearly two years, made a mess of the easiest par-5 on the course for a double bogey and figured he was headed home after a 74. Instead, his 5-over 145 made the cut on the number. Tiger Woods held on the best he could until missing a 12-foot par putt on the 16th hole that left him too much ground to make up. He shot 73 and missed the cut by two. DeChambeau relied more on his putter than his power and will be in the final group with Aberg. It was the ninth time in the last 10 rounds in the majors that DeChambeau has been among the top 10 on the leaderboard. DeChambeau was all over the place – three times following a a birdie with a bogey, saving plenty of pars with putts in the 5-foot range and finishing on a high note with a wedge into tap-in range for birdie on the 18th. “All in all, was very happy with how I stayed patient, gave myself good opportunities when they mattered, and I made a lot of clutch putts coming in,” he said. Cantlay and Matthieu Pavon tried to keep pace with Aberg. Cantlay, a former UCLA and Servite High standout, was flawless through seven holes until he went over the back of rock-hard eighth green, went back over the other wide, took two shots to reach the green and had to make a 12-footer for double bogey. He dropped back again with tee shots into the scruffy dunes with native grasses, leading to bogey on the 16th and keeping him from a birdie chance on the closing hole. “I think this golf course is going to play very challenging over the weekend, especially with the forecast that we have. It’s inevitable there’s going to be some mistakes made, but that’s just part of playing a U.S. Open,” Cantlay said. “The line is very fine around here,” he said. “Just a yard one way or the other can be a dramatic difference.” No line got as much attention as the cut line – and not just whether it would spare Scheffler. Former British Open champion Francesco Molinari was at 7 over when he came to the par-3 ninth for his final hole. He hit 7-iron just over the bunker and it rolled into the cup for an ace, allowing him to make the cut. The PGA Tour only keeps records going back to 2003 and could not find anyone who ended his round with a hole-in-one to make the cut on the number. “That’s golf in a nut shell,” Molinari said. The temperature is expected to get even hotter, the course even tougher. In the previous three U.S. Opens at Pinehurst No. 2, a total of four players finished under par. There were 15 players under par going into the weekend. That included Rory McIlroy, who chipped in for par on the 17th hole and got away with a balky putter for a round of 72 that left him two shots out of the lead. Former Masters champion Hideki Matsuyama had the best score of the second round at 66 and was three behind. PGA champion Xander Schauffele started with two straight bogeys, had a double bogey and still managed a 69 to get within four shots. All of them are chasing Aberg. No one has won the U.S. Open in his first try since 20-year-old Francis Ouimet in 1913 at The Country Club. Aberg is hardly a newcomer to this kind of stage.",

The PGA Tour only keeps records going back to 2003 and could not find anyone who ended his round with a hole-in-one to make the cut on the number. “That’s golf in a nut shell,” Molinari said. The temperature is expected to get even hotter, the course even tougher. In the previous three U.S. Opens at Pinehurst No. 2, a total of four players finished under par. There were 15 players under par going into the weekend. That included Rory McIlroy, who chipped in for par on the 17th hole and got away with a balky putter for a round of 72 that left him two shots out of the lead. Former Masters champion Hideki Matsuyama had the best score of the second round at 66 and was three behind. PGA champion Xander Schauffele started with two straight bogeys, had a double bogey and still managed a 69 to get within four shots. All of them are chasing Aberg. No one has won the U.S. Open in his first try since 20-year-old Francis Ouimet in 1913 at The Country Club. Aberg is hardly a newcomer to this kind of stage.",
                    "summary": "The Swedish star methodically works his way to a 1-under 69 and is at 5-under overall, avoiding big blunders and big numbers on a day of oppressive heat in the North Carolina sand hills that derailed many others. Tiger Woods misses the cut and Scottie Scheffler nearly does.",

                    "text": "BOSTON (AP) — The Celtics picked the most inopportune time to play their worst game of the season. Boston’s 122-84 Game 4 loss to Dallas had all kinds of superlatives, and none of them were good. It ended the Celtics’ 10-game playoff win streak. It was the Celtics’ lowest scoring output of the season and marked the first time the Celtics have allowed the Mavericks to eclipse 100 points in the series on a stellar night for Dallas stars Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. It also reminded the Celtics that putting a championship bow on what has been one of the franchise’s most successful seasons will require the same resilience they’ve shown during a postseason in which they haven’t lost consecutive games. “It’s a learning lesson, for sure. Got to show up and show out every night. They’re not going to roll over,” Celtics reserve Sam Hauser said. “They’re down 3-1 now. They’re desperate. ... They’re not going to make it easy on us.” As humbling as Game 4’s loss was, history will be on the Celtics’ side for Game 5. While Friday’s loss was the seventh time that the Celtics have lost by 20 or more points in the finals, they are 5-1 in the previous six. The game Monday also falls on the 16th anniversary of Boston clinching its last championship in 2008. “It’s a great opportunity to respond,” said Celtics forward Jaylen Brown, whose finished Game 4 with a minus-19 plus-minus – his second-worst of these playoffs and third-worst of his entire playoff career. “We just regroup. We keep our same mentality, and we come out and get ready to fight in another battle on our home floor.” It’s also the latest chance for coach Joe Mazzulla to reinforce the lessons he has tried to instill in a team. .Hauser recalled Boston’s Game 3 win when Dallas rallied to cut a 21-point fourth quarter lead to just one with less than four minutes to play. “The Mavs were on that big run, the start of the fourth there. He came in and said, ‘That was great. That makes us hungrier,’” Hauser said. “He didn’t even focus on the win, he focused on that, which was cool. It keeps all of us grounded and knowing that we have more work to do.” It was the same tone Mazzulla tried to set during the regular season. Boston opened the season by winning its first five games before losing in overtime at Minnesota. Postgame Mazzulla expressed excitement for his team experiencing an opponent challenging it to play its best basketball. Following another loss two nights later at Philadelphia, the Celtics reeled off six straight victories. In February, the Celtics lost on their home court to a Los Angeles Lakers team without both LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Then Boston reeled off a season-high 11-game win streak. The Celtics are now just one more bounce-back win away from seeing those instances of adversity bear championship fruit. If they need any more consolation — each of the Celtics previous three title-winning teams in 1984, 1986 and 2008 all lost with close-out opportunities on the road and then returned to win at home. “Close-out games are hard. Close-out games are tough,” Brown said. “They always have been like that, and you’ve got to have extreme focus. You’ve got to come out and meet their intensity to finish things out.” Jayson Tatum is expecting the TD Garden crowd to bring the energy to match the moment. “I think it’s going to be as loud as it’s ever been in my seven years of being a Celtic,” he said. “Excited to go back home. Celebrate Father’s Day on Sunday and compete for a championship on Monday.” ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",

                    "text": "MOUNT ARAFAT, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Following the footsteps of prophets beneath a burning sun, Muslims from around the world congregated Saturday at a sacred hill in Saudi Arabia for intense, daylong worship and reflection. The ritual at Mount Arafat, known as the hill of mercy, is considered the peak of the Hajj pilgrimage. It is often the most memorable for pilgrims, who stand shoulder to shoulder, feet to feet, asking God for mercy, blessings, prosperity and good health. The mount is about 20 kilometers (12 miles) southeast of Mecca. It’s believed that Prophet Muhammad delivered his final speech, known as the Farewell Sermon, at the sacred mount 1,435 years ago. In the sermon, the prophet called for equality and unity among Muslims. “It’s indescribable,” Ahmed Tukeyia, an Egyptian pilgrim, said on his arrival Friday evening at a tent camp at the foot of Mount Arafat. Hajj is one of the largest religious gatherings on earth. The rituals officially started Friday when pilgrims moved from Mecca’s Grand Mosque to Mina, a desert plain just outside the city. Saudi authorities expect the number of pilgrims this year to exceed 2 million, approaching pre-coronavirus pandemic levels. The pilgrimage is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. All Muslims are required to make the five-day Hajj at least once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to make the demanding pilgrimage. The rituals largely commemorate the Quran’s accounts of Prophet Ibrahim, his son Prophet Ismail and Ismail’s mother Hajar — or Abraham and Ismael as they are named in the Bible. This year’s Hajj came against the backdrop of the raging war in the Gaza Strip between Israel and Hamas, which pushed the Middle East to the brink of a regional war between Israel and its allies on one side and Iran-backed militant groups on the other. Palestinians in the coastal enclave of Gaza were not able to travel to Mecca for Hajj this year because of the closure of the Rafah crossing in May, when Israel extended its ground offensive to the strip’s southern city of Rafah on the border with Egypt. Staving off potential protests or chants about the war during the Hajj, Saudi authorities said they won’t tolerate politicizing the pilgrimage. The time of year when the Hajj takes place varies, given that it is set for five days in the second week of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month in the Islamic lunar calendar. Most of the Hajj rituals are held outdoors with little if any shade. When it falls in the summer months, temperatures can soar to over 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). The Health Ministry has cautioned that temperatures at the holy sites could reach 48 C (118 F). It urged pilgrims to use umbrellas and drink more water to stay hydrated. After Saturday’s worship in Arafat, pilgrims will travel a few kilometers (miles) to a site known as Muzdalifa to collect pebbles that they will use in the symbolic stoning of pillars representing the devil back in Mina. Pilgrims then return to Mina for three days, coinciding with the festive Eid al-Adha holiday, when financially able Muslims around the world slaughter livestock and distribute the meat to poor people. Afterward, they return to Mecca for a final circumambulation, known as Farewell Tawaf. Once the Hajj is over, men are expected to shave their heads, and women to snip a lock of hair in a sign of renewal. Most of the pilgrims then leave Mecca for the city of Medina, some 340 kilometers (210 miles) away, to pray in Prophet Muhammad’s tomb, the Sacred Chamber. The tomb is part of the prophet's mosque, which is one of the three holiest sites in Islam, along with the Grand Mosque in Mecca and the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Hajj is a notorious choke-point for crowds. In 2015, several thousands of pilgrims were crushed to death in a crowd surge. Saudi authorities never offered a final death toll. In recent years, Saudi authorities have made significant efforts to improve access and avoid deadly accidents. Tens of thousands of security personnel were deployed across the city, especially around the holy sites, to control the crowds, and the government built a high-speed rail link to ferry people between holy sites in the city, which has been jammed with traffic during the Hajj season. Pilgrims enter through special electronic gates. Saudi authorities have also expanded and renovated the Grand Mosque where cranes are seen around some of its seven minarets as construction was underway in the holy site. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

                    "text": "More than 1.5 million Muslims braved extreme heat to reach Mount Arafat on Saturday for the high point of the annual hajj pilgrimage, praying for hours, especially for Palestinians in war-ravaged Gaza. Clad in white, worshippers began arriving at dawn for the most gruelling day of the annual rites, ascending the rocky, 70-meter (230-foot) hill where the Prophet Mohammed is believed to have given his last sermon. \"This is the most important day,\" said 46-year-old Egyptian Mohammed Asser, who came prepared with a list of prayers. \"I pray also for the Palestinians. May God help them.\" This year's hajj is unfolding in the shadow of the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, which was triggered by the Palestinian militants' unprecedented attack on southern Israel on October 7. The assault resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 37,266 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-ruled territory's health ministry. Saudi Arabia's minister in charge of religious pilgrimages, Tawfiq al-Rabiah, warned last week that \"no political activity\" would be tolerated during the hajj. But that did not stop at least one pilgrim from chanting in support of the Palestinians who have endured more than eight months of incessant bombardment. \"Pray for our brothers in Palestine, in Gaza... may God give victory to the Muslims,\" he shouted. In a message to hajj pilgrims on Saturday, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said \"the ironclad resistance of Palestine and the patient, oppressed people of Gaza... must be fully supported in every way\". Some 2,000 Palestinians are performing the hajj at the special invitation of Saudi King Salman, official media said. - 'Scary' heat - The hajj, one of the world's biggest religious gatherings, is increasingly affected by climate change, according to a Saudi study published last month that said regional temperatures were rising 0.4 degrees Celsius each decade. The rituals, which take at least five days to complete and are mostly outdoors, are \"not easy because it is very hot\", said Abraman Hawa, 26, from Ghana. \"We have sun... but it is not as hot. But I will pray to Allah at Arafat, because I need his support,\" she added. The temperature was expected to hit 43 degrees Celsius (109.4 degrees Fahrenheit) on Saturday, creating challenges for pilgrims who arrived at Mount Arafat after spending the night in a giant tented city in Mina, a valley outside Mecca, Islam's holiest city. Saudi authorities have urged pilgrims to drink plenty of water and protect themselves from the sun. Since men are prohibited from wearing hats, many carry umbrellas. More than 10,000 heat-related illnesses were recorded last year, 10 percent of them heat stroke, a Saudi official told AFP this week. Ahmad Karim Abdelsalam, a 33-year-old pilgrim from India, admitted that he found the prospect of passing hours on Mount Arafat \"a little scary\". But with the help of an umbrella and water sprays, \"God willing, everything will go well\", he said. - 'Once in a lifetime' - The hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means must perform it at least once. Yet visas, doled out to individual countries on a quota system, can be difficult to obtain. \"It's a chance that only comes once in a lifetime, I couldn't not come,\" said Abdulrahman Siyam, a 55-year-old Iraqi pilgrim who was performing the rituals on a prosthetic leg. After Mount Arafat, the pilgrims will head to Muzdalifah, where they will collect pebbles to carry out the symbolic \"stoning of the devil\" ritual in Mina on Sunday. The hajj is said to follow the path of the Prophet Mohammed's final pilgrimage, about 1,400 years ago. It is an important source of legitimacy for the Al Saud dynasty, whose monarch has the title \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\", in Mecca and Medina. It is also a major financial windfall for the conservative country, which is trying to develop religious tourism as part of a drive to reduce its dependence on crude oil. The kingdom received more than 1.8 million pilgrims last year for the hajj, around 90 percent of whom came from abroad. It also welcomed 13.5 million Muslims who came to perform umrah, the pilgrimage which can be done year-round, and aims to reach 30 million pilgrims in total by 2030.",

                    "text": "MOUNT ARAFAT, Saudi Arabia — Following the footsteps of prophets beneath a burning sun, Muslims from around the world congregated Saturday at a sacred hill in Saudi Arabia for intense, daylong worship and reflection. The ritual at Mount Arafat, known as the hill of mercy, is considered the peak of the Hajj pilgrimage. It is often the most memorable for pilgrims, who stand shoulder to shoulder, feet to feet, asking God for mercy, blessings, prosperity and good health. The mount is about 20 kilometers (12 miles) southeast of Mecca. Thousands of pilgrims walked to the mount through the predawn darkness. On the slopes of the rocky hill and the surrounding area, many raised their hands in worship with tears streaming down their faces. “For sure it is something great. It is the best day for Muslims during the year, and the best feeling that anyone can experience,” Hussein Mohammed, an Egyptian pilgrim, said as he stood on the rocky slopes at dawn. “It is the best place for anyone hoping to be (here) on this day and at this moment.” It’s believed that Prophet Muhammad delivered his final speech, known as the Farewell Sermon, at the sacred mount 1,435 years ago. In the sermon, the prophet called for equality and unity among Muslims. Ali Osman, a Spaniard pilgrim, was overwhelmed, as he stepped down the hill of mercy. He said he felt that he gained spiritual and physical strength at the sacred site. PHOTOS: Muslim pilgrims converge at Mount Arafat for daylong worship as Hajj reaches its peak “The place, thank God, (gives) very good energy,” he said. “I came here, thank God. It is my first time. I hope to come again in the future.” Hajj is one of the largest religious gatherings on earth. The rituals officially started Friday when pilgrims moved from Mecca’s Grand Mosque to Mina, a desert plain just outside the city. Saudi authorities expect the number of pilgrims this year to exceed 2 million, approaching pre-coronavirus pandemic levels. The pilgrimage is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. All Muslims are required to make the five-day Hajj at least once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to make the demanding pilgrimage. The rituals largely commemorate the Quran’s accounts of Prophet Ibrahim, his son Prophet Ismail and Ismail’s mother Hajar - or Abraham and Ismael as they are named in the Bible. This year’s Hajj came against the backdrop of the raging war in the Gaza Strip between Israel and Hamas, which pushed the Middle East to the brink of a regional war between Israel and its allies on one side and Iran-backed militant groups on the other. Palestinians in the coastal enclave of Gaza were not able to travel to Mecca for Hajj this year because of the closure of the Rafah crossing in May, when Israel extended its ground offensive to the strip’s southern city of Rafah on the border with Egypt. Staving off potential protests or chants about the war during the Hajj, Saudi authorities said they won’t tolerate politicizing the pilgrimage. Col. Talal Al-Shalhoub, a spokesperson for the Interior Ministry, told reporters Friday evening that the Saudi government “will not allow any attempt to turn the sacred sites (in Mecca) into an arena for mob chanting.” The time of year when the Hajj takes place varies, given that it is set for five days in the second week of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month in the Islamic lunar calendar. Most of the Hajj rituals are held outdoors with little if any shade. When it falls in the summer months, temperatures can soar to over 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). The Health Ministry has cautioned that temperatures at the holy sites could reach 48 C (118 F) and urged pilgrims to use umbrellas and drink more water to stay hydrated. Most of the pilgrims at Mount Arafat carried umbrellas, while others sat in the shadow of a few trees and buildings around the hill of mercy. And, as at Mina and the Grand Mosque, cooling stations on the roads leading to the mount and in its surrounding areas sprayed pilgrims with water to help fight the heat, which had already climbed to 47 C (116.6 F) at Mount Arafat, according to Saudi Arabia’s National Center for Meteorology. After Saturday’s worship in Mount Arafat, pilgrims will travel a few kilometers (miles) to a site known as Muzdalifa to collect pebbles that they will use in the symbolic stoning of pillars representing the devil back in Mina. Many walk, while others use buses.

Staving off potential protests or chants about the war during the Hajj, Saudi authorities said they won’t tolerate politicizing the pilgrimage. In his sermon Saturday at the sprawling, six-minaret Namera mosque in Arafat, Saudi cleric Maher Bin Hamad al-Mu’wiqly, also cautioned about politicizing Hajj. However, he urged pilgrims to pray for the Palestinians who have been “harmed and hurt by their enemy” that killed them, and “deprived them of what they need from food, medicine and clothing.” He didn’t mention Israel in his sermon. The war has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians there, according to Gaza health officials, while hundreds of others have been killed in Israeli operations in the West Bank. It began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.

And, as at Mina and the Grand Mosque, cooling stations on the roads leading to the hill and in its surrounding areas sprayed pilgrims with water to help fight the heat, which had already climbed to 47 C (116.6 F) at Mount Arafat, according to Saudi metrological authorities. Saudi Health Minister Fahd bin Abdurrahman Al-Jalajel told The Associated Press that more than 150 pilgrims have been treated for heat exhaustion. He urged pilgrims to drink water and carry umbrellas as they perform Hajj’s rituals. As pilgrims perform their worships, contracted migrant cleaners with lime-green jumpsuits were collecting empty water bottles and other trash around Mount Arafat. At sunset Saturday, pilgrims left Mount Arafat, heading to a nearby site known as Muzdalifa to collect pebbles that they will use in the symbolic stoning of pillars representing the devil back in Mina.

                    "text": "CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — South African President Cyril Ramaphosa was reelected by lawmakers for a second term on Friday, after his party struck a dramatic late coalition deal with a former political foe just hours before the vote. Ramaphosa, the leader of the African National Congress, won convincingly in Parliament against a surprise candidate who was also nominated - Julius Malema of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters. Ramaphosa received 283 votes to Malema’s 44 in the 400-member house. The 71-year-old Ramaphosa secured his second term with the help of lawmakers from the country’s second biggest party, the Democratic Alliance, and some smaller parties. They backed him in the vote and got him over the finish line following the ANC’s loss of its long-held majority in a landmark election two weeks ago that reduced it to 159 seats in Parliament. During a break in what turned out to be a marathon parliamentary session, the ANC signed the last-minute agreement with the DA, effectively ensuring Ramaphosa stays on as the leader of Africa’s most industrialized economy. The parties will now co-govern South Africa in its first national coalition where no party has a majority in Parliament. The deal, referred to as a government of national unity, brings the ANC together with the DA, a white-led party that had for years been the main opposition and the fiercest critic of the ANC. At least two other smaller parties also joined the agreement. Ramaphose called the deal - which sent South Africa into uncharted waters - a “new birth, a new era for our country” and said it was time for parties “to overcome their differences and to work together.” “This is what we shall do and this is what I am committed to achieve as the president,” he said. The ANC - the famed party of Nelson Mandela - had ruled South Africa with a comfortable majority since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. But it lost its 30-year majority in the humbling national election on May 29, a turning point for the country. The vote was held against the backdrop of widespread discontent from South Africans over high levels of poverty, inequality and unemployment. Analysts warn there might be complications ahead, though, given the starkly different ideologies of the ANC, a former liberation movement, and the centrist, business-friendly DA, which won 21% of the vote in the national election, the second largest share behind the ANC’s 40%. For one, the DA disagreed with the ANC government’s move to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza in a highly sensitive case at the United Nations’ top court. The DA leader John Steenhuisen was the first to confirm the agreement. “From today, the DA will co-govern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration,” he said as he stepped away from Friday’s proceedings for a speech carried live on television in which he said a deal was signed and that the DA lawmakers would vote for Ramaphosa for president. The Parliament session started at 10 a.m. in the unusual setting of a conference center near Cape Town’s waterfront, after the city’s historic National Assembly building was gutted in a fire in 2022. The house first went through the hourslong swearing-in of hundreds of new lawmakers and electing a speaker and a deputy speaker. The vote for president started late at night, with the results announced well after 10 p.m. Ramaphosa finished his acceptance speech as the clock ticked past midnight and into Saturday. Former President Jacob Zuma’s MK Party boycotted the session but that did not affect the voting as only a third of the house is needed for a quorum. ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula said the party was open to talking with anyone else who wanted to join the unity government. There are 18 political parties represented in Parliament and he said the multi-party agreement would “prioritize the country across the political and ideological divide.” Some parties, including Malema’s EFF, refused to join. The two other parties that joined the coalition deal were the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Patriotic Alliance, which has drawn attention partly because its leader, Gayton McKenzie, served a prison sentence for bank robbery. McKenzie said he had been given a second chance in life and that South Africa also had one now, a chance to solve its deep socioeconomic problems. The ANC had faced a deadline to strike a coalition agreement as Parliament had to vote for the president within 14 days after election results were declared on June 2. The ANC had been trying to strike a coalition agreement for two weeks and the final negotiations went on overnight Thursday to Friday, party officials said. South Africa has not faced that level of political uncertainty since the ANC swept to power in the 1994 first all-race election that ended nearly a half-century of racial segregation. Since then, every South African leader has come from the ANC, starting with Mandela. The new unity government also harked back to the way Mandela, South Africa’s first Black president, invited political opponents to be part of a unity government in 1994 in an act of reconciliation when the ANC had a majority. Ramaphosa had played a key role in those negotiations as a young politician. This time, the ANC’s hand was forced. “The ANC has been very magnanimous in that they have accepted defeat and have said, ‘let’s talk’,” PA leader McKenzie said.",

A deal struck among members of Ramaphosa's African National Congress and members of Democratic Alliance Party resulted in the South African Parliament re-electing Ramaphosa Friday evening. Ramaphosa's re-election chances dimmed in May when the ANC lost its majority status in Parliament after voters expressed frustration regarding a relative lack of improvement for the nation's Black population. ANC got 40% of the vote, while the DAP came second with 22%. Corruption, unemployment and crime also made voters unhappy with the status quo in the South African Parliament. May's vote was the first time in 30 years that the Nelson Mandela-founded ANC lost its majority status in the South African Parliament. The ANC and the nation's second-largest political party, the DAP, created a new coalition that Ramaphosa on Friday said will \"work together for the good of everyone in our country.\" Ramaphosa next will create a new cabinet that will include members of the DAP as well as the ANC. The ANC held majority status since 1994, when South Africa first held democratic elections and Mandela was elected president.",

                    "text": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The United States military unleashed a wave of attacks targeting radar sites operated by Yemen's Houthi rebels over their assaults on shipping in the crucial Red Sea corridor, authorities said Saturday, after one merchant sailor went missing following an earlier Houthi strike on a ship. The attacks come as the U.S. Navy faces the most intense combat it has seen since World War II in trying to counter the Houthi campaign — attacks the rebels say are meant to halt the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. However, the Iranian-backed rebel assaults often see the Houthis target ships and sailors who have nothing to do with the war while traffic remains halved through a corridor vital for cargo and energy shipments between Asia, Europe and the Mideast. U.S. strikes destroyed seven radars within Houthi-controlled territory, the military's Central Command said. It did not elaborate on how the sites were destroyed and did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press. “These radars allow the Houthis to target maritime vessels and endanger commercial shipping,” Central Command said in a statement. The U.S. separately destroyed two bomb-laden drone boats in the Red Sea, as well as a drone launched by the Houthis over the waterway, it said. The Houthis, who have held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014, did not acknowledge the strikes, nor any military losses. That's been typical since the U.S. began launching airstrikes targeting the rebels. Meanwhile, Central Command said one commercial sailor from the Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned bulk cargo carrier Tutor remained missing after an attack Wednesday by the Houthis that used a bomb-carrying drone boat to strike the vessel. “The crew abandoned ship and were rescued by USS Philippine Sea and partner forces,” Central Command said. The “Tutor remains in the Red Sea and is slowly taking on water.” The missing sailor is Filipino, according to the state-run Philippine News Agency, which cited Migrant Workers Secretary Hans Leo Cacdac. He said most of the Tutor's 22 mariners were from the Philippines. \"We’re trying to account for the particular seafarer in the ship and are praying that we could find him,” he reportedly said Friday night. The Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. A U.S.-led airstrike campaign has targeted the Houthis since January, with a series of strikes May 30 killing at least 16 people and wounding 42 others, the rebels say. The war in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians there, according to Gaza health officials, while hundreds of others have been killed in Israeli operations in the West Bank. It began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage. “The Houthis claim to be acting on behalf of Palestinians in Gaza and yet they are targeting and threatening the lives of third-country nationals who have nothing to do with the conflict in Gaza,” Central Command said. “The ongoing threat to international commerce caused by the Houthis in fact makes it harder to deliver badly needed assistance to the people of Yemen as well as Gaza.”",

                    "title": "Missouri woman's conviction for a murder her lawyers say a police officer committed overturned after 43 years",
                    "text": "A Missouri woman who spent more than 43 years in prison for a murder her attorneys argue was committed by a now-discredited police officer could soon be released after a judge overturned the conviction. If released, Sandra Hemme's prison term will mark the longest known wrongful conviction of a woman in U.S. history, her attorneys said.Judge Ryan Horsman ruled late Friday that Hemme has established evidence of actual innocence and must be freed within 30 days unless prosecutors retry her. He said her trial counsel was ineffective and prosecutors failed to disclose evidence that would have helped her.Hemme's attorneys with the New York-based Innocence Project filed a motion seeking her immediate release.\"We are grateful to the Court for acknowledging the grave injustice Ms. Hemme has endured for more than four decades,\" her attorneys said in a statement, promising to keep up their efforts to dismiss the charges and reunite Hemme with her family.A spokesperson for Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey didn't immediately respond to a text or email message from The Associated Press seeking comment Saturday.Hemme was shackled in leather wrist restraints and so heavily sedated that she \"could not hold her head up straight\" or \"articulate anything beyond monosyllabic responses\" when she was first questioned about the death of 31-year-old library worker Patricia Jeschke, according to her lawyers.They alleged in a petition seeking her exoneration that authorities ignored Hemme's \"wildly contradictory\" statements and suppressed evidence implicating Michael Holman, a then-police officer who tried to use the slain woman's credit card.\"No witnesses linked Ms. Hemme to the murder, the victim, or the crime scene. She had no motive to harm Ms. Jeschke, nor was there any evidence that the two had ever met,\" Hemme's attorneys said.The judge wrote that \"no evidence whatsoever outside of Ms. Hemme's unreliable statements connects her to the crime.\"\"In contrast,\" he added, \"this Court finds that the evidence directly ties Holman to this crime and murder scene.\"It started on Nov. 13, 1980, when Jeschke missed work. Her worried mother climbed through a window at her apartment and discovered her daughter's nude body on the floor, surrounded by blood. Her hands were tied behind her back with a telephone cord and a pair of pantyhose was wrapped around her throat. A knife was under her head.The brutal killing grabbed headlines, with detectives working 12-hour days to solve it. But Hemme wasn't on their radar until she showed up nearly two weeks later at the home of a nurse who once treated her, carrying a knife and refusing to leave.Police found her in a closet, and took her back to St. Joseph's Hospital, the latest in a string of hospitalizations that began when she started hearing voices at the age of 12.She had been discharged from that very hospital the day before Jeschke's body was found, showing up at her parents' house later that night after hitchhiking more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) across the state.The timing seemed suspicious to law enforcement. As the interrogations began, Hemme was being treated with antipsychotic drugs that had triggered involuntary muscle spasms. She complained that her eyes were rolling back in her head, the petition said.Detectives noted that Hemme seemed \"mentally confused\" and not fully able to comprehend their questions.\"Each time the police extracted a statement from Ms. Hemme it changed dramatically from the last, often incorporating explanations of facts the police had just recently uncovered,\" her attorneys wrote.Eventually, she claimed to have watched a man named Joseph Wabski kill Jeschke.Wabski, whom she met when they stayed in the state hospital's detoxification unit at the same time, was charged with capital murder. But prosecutors quickly dropped the case upon learning he was at an alcohol treatment center in Topeka, Kansas, at the time.Upon learning he couldn't be the killer, Hemme cried and she said was the lone killer.But police also were starting to look at another suspect — one of their own. About a month after the killing, Holman was arrested for falsely reporting that his pickup truck had been stolen and collecting an insurance payout. It was the same truck spotted near the crime scene, and the officer's alibi that he spent the night with a woman at a nearby motel couldn't be confirmed.Furthermore, he had tried to use Jeschke's credit card at a camera store in Kansas City, Missouri, on the same day her body was found. Holman, who ultimately was fired and died in 2015, said he found the card in a purse that had been discarded in a ditch.During a search of Holman's home, police found a pair of gold horseshoe-shaped earrings in a closet, along with jewelry stolen from another woman during a burglary earlier that year.Jeschke's father said he recognized the earrings as a pair he bought for his daughter. But then the four-day investigation into Holman ended abruptly, many of the details uncovered never given to Hemme's attorneys.Hemme, meanwhile, was growing desperate. She wrote to her parents on Christmas Day 1980, saying, \"Even though I'm innocent, they want to put someone away, so they can say the case is solved.\" She said she might as well change her plea to guilty.\"Just let it end,\" she said. \"I'm tired.\"And that is what she did the following spring, when she agreed to plead guilty to capital murder in exchange for the death penalty being taken off the table.Even that was a challenge; the judge initially rejected her guilty plea because she couldn't share enough details about what happened, saying: \"I really didn't know I had done it until like three days later, you know, when it came out in the paper and on the news.\"Her attorney told her that her chance to not be sentenced to death was to get the judge to accept her guilty plea. After a recess and some coaching, she provided more information.That plea later was thrown out on appeal. But she was convicted again in 1985 after a one-day trial in which jurors weren't told of what her current attorneys describe as \"grotesquely coercive\" interrogations.Larry Harman, who helped Hemme get her initial guilty plea thrown out and later became a judge, said in the petition that he believed she was innocent.\"The system,\" he said, \"failed her at every opportunity.\"",

                    "text": "A judge has overturned the conviction of a Missouri woman who was a psychiatric patient when she incriminated herself in a 1980 killing that her attorneys argue was actually committed by a now-discredited police officer. Judge Ryan Horsman ruled late Friday that Sandra Hemme, who has spent 43 years behind bars, had established evidence of actual innocence and must be freed within 30 days unless prosecutors retry her. He said her trial counsel was ineffective and prosecutors failed to disclose evidence that would have helped her. Her attorneys say this is the longest time a women has been been incarcerated for a wrongful conviction. They filed a motion seeking her immediate release. “We are grateful to the Court for acknowledging the grave injustice Ms. Hemme has endured for more than four decades,” her attorneys said in a statement, promising to keep up their efforts to dismiss the charges and reunite Hemme with her family. A spokesperson for Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey didn't immediately respond to a text or email message seeking comment Saturday. Hemme was shackled in leather wrist restraints and so heavily sedated that she “could not hold her head up straight” or “articulate anything beyond monosyllabic responses\" when she was first questioned about the death of 31-year-old library worker Patricia Jeschke, according to her lawyers with the New York-based Innocence Project. They alleged in a petition seeking her exoneration that authorities ignored Hemme's “wildly contradictory” statements and suppressed evidence implicating Michael Holman, a then-police officer who tried to use the slain woman's credit card. The judge wrote that “no evidence whatsoever outside of Ms. Hemme’s unreliable statements connects her to the crime.” “In contrast,” he added, “this Court finds that the evidence directly ties Holman to this crime and murder scene.” It started on Nov. 13, 1980, when Jeschke missed work. Her worried mother climbed through a window at her apartment and discovered her daughter's nude body on the floor, surrounded by blood. Her hands were tied behind her back with a telephone cord and a pair of pantyhose was wrapped around her throat. A knife was under her head. The brutal killing grabbed headlines, with detectives working 12-hour days to solve it. But Hemme wasn't on their radar until she showed up nearly two weeks later at the home of a nurse who once treated her, carrying a knife and refusing to leave. Police found her in a closet, and took her back to St. Joseph’s Hospital, the latest in a string of hospitalizations that began when she started hearing voices at the age of 12. She had been discharged from that very hospital the day before Jeschke's body was found, showing up at her parents house later that night after hitchhiking more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) across the state. The timing seemed suspicious to law enforcement. As the interrogations began, Hemme was being treated with antipsychotic drugs that had triggered involuntary muscle spasms. She complained that her eyes were rolling back in her head, the petition said. Detectives noted that Hemme seemed “mentally confused” and not fully able to comprehend their questions. “Each time the police extracted a statement from Ms. Hemme it changed dramatically from the last, often incorporating explanations of facts the police had just recently uncovered,” her attorneys wrote. Eventually, she claimed to have watched a man named Joseph Wabski kill Jeschke. Wabski, whom she met when they stayed in the state hospital’s detoxification unit at the same time, was charged with capital murder. But prosecutors quickly dropped the case upon learning he was at an alcohol treatment center in Topeka, Kansas, at the time. Upon learning he couldn't be the killer, Hemme cried and she said was the lone killer. But police also were starting to look at another suspect — one of their own. About a month after the killing, Holman was arrested for falsely reporting that his pickup truck had been stolen and collecting an insurance payout. It was the same truck spotted near the crime scene, and the officer's alibi that he spent the night with a woman at a nearby motel couldn't be confirmed. Furthermore, he had tried to use Jeschke’s credit card at a camera store in Kansas City, Missouri, on the same day her body was found. Holman, who ultimately was fired and died in 2015, said he found the card in a purse that had been discarded in a ditch. During a search of Holman's home, police found a pair of gold horseshoe-shaped earrings in a closet, along with jewelry stolen from another woman during a burglary earlier that year. Jeschke's father said he recognized the earrings as a pair he bought for his daughter. But then the four-day investigation into Holman ended abruptly, many of the details uncovered never given to Hemme's attorneys. Hemme, meanwhile, was growing desperate. She wrote to her parents on Christmas Day 1980, saying, “Even though I'm innocent, they want to put someone away, so they can say the case is solved.” She said she might as well change her plea to guilty. “Just let it end,” she said. “I'm tired.” And that is what she did the following spring, when she agreed to plead guilty to capital murder in exchange for the death penalty being taken off the table. Even that was a challenge; the judge initially rejected her guilty plea because she couldn't share enough details about what happened, saying: “I really didn’t know I had done it until like three days later, you know, when it came out in the paper and on the news.” Her attorney told her that her chance to not be sentenced to death was to get the judge to accept her guilty plea. After a recess and some coaching, she provided more information. That plea later was thrown out on appeal. But she was convicted again in 1985 after a one-day trial in which jurors weren't told of what her current attorneys describe as “grotesquely coercive” interrogations. Larry Harman, who helped Hemme get her initial guilty plea thrown out and later became a judge, said in the petition that he believed she was innocent. “The system,” he said, “failed her at every opportunity.” ___ Associated Press researcher Jennifer Farrar in New York contributed.",

                    "text": "Kate Middleton is back on the balcony of Buckingham Palace amid her cancer treatment. The Princess of Wales, 42, who hasn't attended a public event with the royal family since Christmas, attended Trooping the Colour on June 15. For the day's grand finale — the Royal Air Force's flypast over London — she stood on the royal residence's balcony with her husband, Prince William, and their children, Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 9, and Prince Louis, 6, as they joined King Charles (who is also undergoing treatment for cancer), Queen Camilla and more royals for the monarch’s annual birthday parade. Princess Kate, who wore a white dress by Jenny Packham adorned with the Irish Guards Regimental Brooch and paired with a hat by Philip Treacy, took part in the royal processional earlier in the event, riding in a horse-drawn carriage with her three children. The Princess of Wales has attended Trooping the Colour every year since marrying Prince William in 2011, except for 2020 and 2021 when the event was scaled down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Kate, who is undergoing chemotherapy after being diagnosed with cancer earlier this year, shared a health update on June 14, revealing in a personal message that she is “making good progress” but has “good days and bad days.” \"On those bad days, you feel weak, tired and you have to give in to your body resting. But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well,\" she said. The Princess of Wales said her cancer treatment will continue for \"a few more months.\" Can't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

Taking each day as it comes, listening to my body, and allowing myself to take this much-needed time to heal. Thank you so much for your continued understanding, and to all of you who have so bravely shared your stories with me.\" Despite maintaining a low public profile since her cancer announcement in March, Kate was recently spotted out with her family and running errands solo, sources told PEOPLE. The Princess of Wales said in her June 14 message that she is \"starting to do a little work from home\" and expressed a \"hope to join a few public engagements over the summer. However, no date has been set for her to fully return to her royal duties and any outings in the coming months will be based on when she feels able and under the guidance of her medical team.",

                    "text": "King Charles' birthday parade ended with a Trooping the Colour highlight: the royal family's Buckingham Palace balcony appearance! Members of the royal family gathered on June 15 for the official celebrations of the monarch's birthday. After the procession through London, the 75-year-old King took the royal salute and inspected the troops at Horse Guard's Parade before returning to Buckingham Palace to watch a flypast performed by the Royal Air Force. Joining King Charles for the biggest photo op of the day on the palace's balcony was his wife, Queen Camilla. The monarch's eldest son and heir, Prince William, also stood on the balcony after riding on horseback in the procession joined by his children: Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. In a significant moment, Kate Middleton also stepped out onto the palace balcony in her first royal outing since revealing her cancer diagnosis. The Princess of Wales' attendance at Trooping the Colour was confirmed the day prior as she released a new photo and personal letter featuring an update on her health: \"I'm looking forward to attending the King’s Birthday Parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer, but equally knowing I am not out of the woods yet.\" Princess Kate, 42, said in her June 14 message that she is \"starting to do a little work from home\" and expressed her \"hope to join a few public engagements over the summer.\" However, her Trooping the Colour appearance does not signal a full return to her royal duties. Any upcoming outings will depend on when she feels able and under the guidance of her medical team. Other royals on the balcony included Prince Edward and Sophie (the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh) with their daughter, Lady Louise. However, their son, James, Earl of Wessex, did not join the festivities. Princess Anne and her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, also stepped out with the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester as well as the Duke of Kent. Can't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

Although extended members of the royal family have squeezed onto the Buckingham Palace balcony for Trooping the Colour in years past, there was a change made in 2022 by Queen Elizabeth when only senior working members of the royal family and some of their children. That meant that Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Prince Andrew and other non-working members of the royal family did not join Queen Elizabeth for the appearance. Instead, other family members watched the 2022 festivities from the Major General's Office, which overlooks the parade grounds.",

The conference was organized with the goal of outlining initial steps towards achieving peace in Ukraine.Harris made the announcement at the Ukraine peace summit in Lucerne, Switzerland, where she held discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.According to Reuters, Harris, during the bilateral meeting with Zelenskiy, said, \"This war remains an utter failure for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin. It is in our interest to uphold international norms.\"The $1.5 billion includes $500 million in new funding allocated for energy assistance, along with the redirection of $324 million from previously announced funds towards emergency energy infrastructure repairs and other essential needs in Ukraine, as confirmed by the vice president's office.More than $379 million from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development will be directed towards assisting millions of people affected by the war, including refugees.The announcement followed a deal reached on Thursday by President Biden and leaders from the wealthiest democratic nations to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan this year, backed by frozen Russian assets. This agreement underscores a resolute commitment to counter Russia's invasion, according to U.S. officials.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been urging allies to provide increased assistance as Moscow has stepped up attacks recently in the Kharkiv area. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Swiss officials hosting the conference stated that over 50 heads of state and government, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, were expected to attend the gathering at the Bürgenstock resort overlooking Lake Lucerne. Alongside many Western leaders, the presidents of Ecuador, Ivory Coast, Kenya, and Somalia participated, while Russia notably did not attend, reported NBC News.China, aligned with Russia, has chosen not to participate in the conference, alongside many other nations preoccupied with pressing domestic and international issues amidst what is described as Europe's most deadly conflict since World War II. Beijing emphasizes that any effective peace process must include both Russia and Ukraine, and has put forward its own proposals for achieving peace in the region.",

                    "text": "US vice-president, Kamala Harris, has pledged more than $1.5bn in aid for Ukraine’s energy sector and its humanitarian situation amid its ongoing war with Russia. Harris made the announcement at a peace summit in Lucerne, Switzerland, where she met Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. She is expected to address the summit later. “This war remains an utter failure for (Russian president Vladimir) Putin,” Harris said during a bilateral meeting with Zelenskiy. “It is in our interest to uphold international norms,” she added, pledging US support for the country. The $1.5bn includes $500m in new funding for energy assistance and the redirecting of $324m in previously announced funds towards emergency energy infrastructure repair and other needs in Ukraine, the vice-president’s office said. “These efforts will help Ukraine respond to Russia’s latest attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure by supporting repair and recovery, improving Ukraine’s resilience to energy supply disruptions, and laying the groundwork to repair and expand Ukraine’s energy system,” Harris’ office said. She also announced more than $379m in humanitarian assistance from the state department and the US Agency for International Development to help refugees and other people affected by the war. The money is to cover food assistance, health services, shelter, and water, sanitation and hygiene services for millions of Ukrainians. Harris, who will spend less than 24 hours at the gathering, will be standing in for US president, Joe Biden, at the event.

                    "text": "The Biden administration has unveiled a new $1.5 billion aid package for Ukraine’s energy sector and humanitarian situation as the embattled nation attempts to fend off Russia’s attack. The latest tranche includes $500 million in new funding for energy assistance and the redirecting of another previously announced $324 million in funds toward emergency energy infrastructure repair, through U.S. Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Vice President Kamala Harris announced the new assistance package while attending the Ukraine Peace Summit in Lucerne, Switzerland, where she met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “This funding will repair energy infrastructure damaged in the war, expand power generation, encourage private sector investment, and protect energy infrastructure,” USAID said in a statement on Saturday. “These efforts will help Ukraine respond to Russia’s latest attacks on Ukraine energy infrastructure by supporting repair and recovery, improving Ukraine’s resilience to energy supply disruptions, and laying the groundwork to repair and expand Ukraine’s energy system.” Ms. Harris also unveiled at the summit that more than $379 million in humanitarian assistance from State and USAID will be provided to Ukraine to help address “urgent needs of refugees, internally displaced persons, and conflict-affected communities” impacted by the ongoing conflict. According to the Biden administration, this money is to further expand food assistance, health services, shelter, water, sanitation, and hygiene services for “millions of vulnerable Ukrainians” throughout the country. “The assistance also includes support for comprehensive protection activities, including case management and psychosocial support services, as well as agriculture and livelihoods assistance to enable families to restore income and meet their basic needs,” USAID said. Ms. Harris also announced that, in a joint effort with U.S. Congress, the State Department plans to provide an additional $300 million in Ukrainian civilian security assistance to support life-saving equipment for Ukrainian border guards and law enforcement. She said this endeavor will assist Ukrainians in safely operating on the front lines of the war to defend the country’s territory, rescue civilians, and protect critical infrastructure. Since the start of the war over two years ago, the United States has devoted nearly $1.5 billion to help Ukraine’s energy sector and enable it to produce clean and reliable energy, according to USAID. Ms. Harris and national security adviser Jake Sullivan are standing in for President Joe Biden at the event. The president will be just ending his participation at the G7 summit in Italy and returning to the United States to attend a fundraiser for his reelection campaign. President Biden met with Mr. Zelenskyy at the G7 summit, where they signed a U.S.–Ukraine bilateral security agreement, and in France for events surrounding the 80th anniversary of the World War Two D-Day invasion. Sullivan will represent the United States at the summit on June 16 and help establish working groups on returning Ukrainian children from Russia and on energy security.",

The agency said someone called about a possible animal in the road at 4:48 a.m. Wildlife advocates hope the crossing can save the threatened local population of mountain lions from extinction, which could become inevitable if lions continue a historic pattern of inbreeding due to the limited numbers of cats in the area.

                    "text": "A mountain lion was found dead Saturday morning on the 101 Freeway in Agoura Hills, not far from a wildlife crossing being built to reduce the number of cougar fatalities. The puma's body was discovered about 5 a.m. in the far right lane of the freeway near Liberty Canyon Road, according to the California Highway Patrol. Troopers moved the cougar to the shoulder of the highway and enlisted the help of California Fish and Wildlife, which confirmed Saturday morning that it collected the mountain lion’s body for gathering DNA. The cougar, which was not wearing a monitoring collar, was killed near the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing, a $30-million passageway that crosses over the busy 10-lane freeway, said Beth Pratt, regional executive director of the National Wildlife Federation. It was likely hit by a car; she said there was fresh blood on the freeway. She said not much else is yet known about the mountain lion, including its age or sex. “Obviously we have a solution coming, but it didn't come soon enough for this cat,” Pratt said. “This is just another harsh reminder that this is the right place [for the crossing].” Construction of the wildlife passage began in 2022, and it is set to be completed in 2026. It is considered the largest wildlife crossing in the world, Pratt said, in a much-needed area where mountain lions are known to attempt to cross. Already, there are signs that other animals are using the crossing, and by the end of the year, officials hope to begin adding soil and plants to the crossing so that it blends into the environment and creates a safe space for the animals, Pratt said. In January, Uno, a female mountain lion often seen patrolling the mountains in Orange County, was killed after being struck by a vehicle on a road near the Limestone Canyon Nature Preserve. The cougar, identified as F312, had been tagged by researchers in 2021 when she was about 2 years old. In January 2023, mountain lion P-81 was killed on Pacific Coast Highway, probably struck by a car, the National Park Service announced. The 4-year-old male cougar’s remains were collected on PCH near Las Posas Road in Ventura County. In July 2022, mountain lion P-89, a 2-year-old male, was fatally struck by a car on the 101 Freeway in Woodland Hills. That death came about a month after a 5-year-old female mountain lion had been killed by a car in the Santa Monica Mountains.",

                    "text": "Britain is putting on a display of birthday pageantry Saturday for King Charles III, a military parade that will be the Princess of Wales ’ first public appearance since her cancer diagnosis early this year. The annual event is also a show of stability by the monarchy after months in which both the king and Kate, wife of heir to the throne Prince William, have been sidelined by cancer treatment. Kate announced Friday that she would attend the King’s Birthday Parade after making progress in her treatment. She disclosed in March that she was undergoing chemotherapy for an unspecified form of cancer. “I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days,” Kate said in a statement, adding that she faces “a few more months” of treatment. The 42-year-old princess is expected to travel by horse-drawn carriage from Buckingham Palace with her children George, 10, Charlotte, 9, and 6-year-old Louis. She will watch the ceremony from a building overlooking Horse Guards Parade, a ceremonial parade ground in central London. Prince William will be on horseback for the ceremony, also known as Trooping the Color, in which troops in full dress uniform parade past the king with their regimental flag, or “color.” Charles, who also is being treated for an undisclosed form of cancer, is due to inspect the troops alongside Queen Camilla from a carriage. Charles, 75, disclosed his cancer in February, and has recently eased back into public duties. He attended commemorations last week for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe on June 6, 1944. Kate is likely to join other members of the family on a Buckingham Palace balcony to watch a flypast of military aircraft -– and delight the crowds below. The princess has not made any public appearances since December. Kate said in her statement that she is “not out of the woods yet” and officials stress that Saturday’s engagement does not herald a full return to public life. In one of the many quirks of British royal convention, Saturday is not the king’s real birthday -– that’s in November. Like his mother Queen Elizabeth II before him, Charles has an official birthday on the second Saturday in June. The date was chosen because the weather is generally good, though early sunshine on Saturday gave way to a blustery, rainy day in London. Royal fans in raincoats and umbrellas had already gathered along the route several hours before start time, along with a smattering of anti-monarchist protesters chanting “Not my king.” Spectators will be treated to a display of pomp and precision involving more than 1,000 soldiers, 250 military musicians and more than 200 horses. The equine participants will include Trojan, Tennyson, and Vanquish, three of the five military horses who sparked mayhem in April when they bolted and ran loose through central London. The horses were performing routine exercises near Buckingham Palace on April 24 when they became spooked by noise from a nearby building site and galloped loose through the capital’s streets, crashing into vehicles and causing chaos during the morning rush hour. The army says the other two horses are recovering well and are expected to return to duty. Where can I watch Trooping the Colour? You can watch live coverage of the parade starting at 5:30 a.m. ET, 10:30 a.m. local time on Sky News and on BBC. Will William and King Charles be in attendance? Yes, William along with their three children George, 10, Charlotte, 8, and Louis, 5 will be in attendance. King Charles III and Queen Camilla will also be present. William is expected to be on horseback this year. In what events will Kate take part in Trooping the Colour? As in previous years, Kate will join the royal family on a Buckingham Palace balcony to watch the military flyover.",

                    "text": "“House of the Dragon” Season 2 is finally here, and the Dance of the Dragons civil war is taking center stage. There were a lot of moving parts in the first season of the show. Many new faces, tangled family trees, a full decade time jump that saw characters swapping actors. It can be a lot to hold in your head and feel caught up in the near two years since the series premiered. We’re here to help and give you the distilled SparkNotes version of “HotD” Season 1 and remind you of all the major players before jumping in to Season 2. Dive into our “House of the Dragon” Season 1 recap for everything you need to know to get you ready to head back to Westeros. Question of Succession The series begins 200 years before “Game of Thrones” with the death of Old King Jaehaerys I Targaryen. A council is convened to decide who the next Westerosi ruler will be and Viserys I Targaryen (Paddy Considine) is selected over his cousin Rhaenys Targaryen (Eve Best) despite her having the stronger claim. Viserys’ rule is largely a peaceful one until his latest attempts at producing a male heir ends with the death of both the son and his wife Aemma Arryn. Rather than announce that his brother Daemon Targaryen (Matt Smith) would become heir, Viserys controversially decrees his only living child – his daughter Rhaenyra Targaryen (Milly Alcock/Emma D’Arcy) – would succeed him on the throne. The choice to place a woman there is the first of many decisions that lead to civil war. Hightower Schemes Following Viserys’ announcement, many powerful houses begin trying to convince the king to remarry and produce a son. Chief among them is Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) who serves as Hand of the King. He places his daughter Alicent Hightower (Emma Carey/Olivia Cooke) in Viserys’ path and soon the king begins to fall for the girl he had only seen before as a friend of Rhaenyra’s. Despite the Velaryons also trying to turn the king’s head with a daughter of their own – the very young Laena Velaryon – eventually Viserys decides on Alicent and the two are wed and produce a son, Aegon II. Rhaenyra’s Messy Love Life It wouldn’t be a show set in Westeros without some incest and it’s clear early on in Season 1 that young Rhaenyra is drawn to her uncle Daemon. The two have a bond and she seems pretty set on him, at least until a tournament finds Daemon defeated by a young soldier named Criston Cole (Fabien Frankel). Rhaenyra and the new knight begin their own fling even as she’s set to marry Laenor Velaryon (John Macmillan). Learning that her planned-betrothed prefers the company of men, Rhaenyra and Laenor agree to see others in secret and her relationship with Cole continues. Eventually, Cole pitches Rhaenyra the idea of her leaving Westeros, throwing away her claim to the throne and living with him across the Narrow Sea. She refuses, which not only ends their relationship but spurs Cole to cause a scene at Rhaenyra and Laenor’s wedding where he kills Laenor’s lover. His feelings are so jilted he’ll end up siding with Alicent and Team Green, becoming obsessive over making sure Rhaenyra never sits the Iron Throne. A time jump 10 years into the future finds Rhaenyra and Laenor still married but now with three kids. The worst kept secret in King’s Landing is that the kids aren’t actually a product of their marriage but of Rhaenyra and her secret lover Harwin Strong (Ryan Corr). Alicent becomes suspicious of Rhaenyra’s children after being proposed a Targaryen/Hightower marriage and has Larys Strong – Harwin’s brother – look into it. Larys responds by having his brother and father both killed. A short time later, the death of Daemon’s second wife brings the many tangled families to Driftmark for a funeral. It’s there – after a fight between Rhaenyra and Alicent’s kids leaves Alicent’s second son Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) without an eye – that Daemon helps Laenor fake his death and escape across the Narrow Sea. With him out of the picture, Daemon and Rhaenyra are finally free to marry which helps strengthen her claim to the throne right as things are reaching a tipping point between herself and Alicent. Deathbed Misunderstanding While all this was going on, Viserys was having serious health problems. Whatever the Westerosi equivalent of leprosy was, the king had it. By the season’s eighth episode, it’s hard for the king to even get out of bed and when he does he’s hunched over, using a cane, and wears a gold mask to hide the fact that his face is falling off. Years earlier, after announcing Rhaenyra to be his heir, Viserys confided in his daughter a secret that only Westeros’ rulers knew – a prophecy passed from Aegon the Conqueror called “A Song of Ice and Fire” that told of a coming darkness that would take the entire kingdom united to defeat. This prophecy is what plays out in “Game of Thrones.” Cut back to the present, Viserys gives a rousing speech at what would be his last supper about the family coming together. Largely, it seems to work as Alicent and Rhaenyra cheer, the kids dance, and there’s generally a feeling of the hatchet being buried. That night Viserys dies with Alicent in the room, but not before muttering to himself. All Alicent hears are “Aegon” and “Prince That Was Promised.” She interprets this as the king actually wanting their son Aegon II (Tom Glynn-Carney) to sit on the throne instead of Rhaenyra when his final thoughts were actually on the “Ice and Fire” prophecy. Alicent informs her father Otto and the two convene The Green Council. In it they plot to place Aegon on the throne, pushing out or outright killing anyone loyal to Rhaenyra and forcing her to flee King’s Landing. They’re successful in placing the son on the Iron Throne but loyalties across the kingdom remain split. The Bloody Season 1 Finale With Aegon II now seated on the Iron Throne, Rhaenyra continues to claim herself as the Queen – backed by the fact that the crown was secreted out of King’s Landing and brought to her on Dragonstone where she and her own council planned their next move. What they need is allies so she sends her two sons – the eldest, Jace (Harry Collett) and the younger, Luke (Elliot Grihault) – as envoys to Winterfell and Storm’s End respectively. The hope is to get the Starks and Baratheons to side with Rhaenyra and her claim to the throne. When Luke arrives at Storm’s End he finds Aemond and his massive dragon Vhagar already there. Alicent and Viserys’ second born beat Luke to the Baratheons and offered to marry a daughter to secure their alliance. When Luke sees there’s nothing better for him to offer he leaves – but Aemond and Vhagar follow. Aemond and Vhagar begin toying with Luke and his much smaller dragon Arrax in the air but when Arrax burns Vhagar, the larger dragon disobeys Aemond and ends up killing both Luke and his dragon. The season ends with Daemon informing Rhaenyra about the death of her son and her vowing vengeance. Team Black vs. Team Green With the beginning of Season 2, the Dance of the Dragons civil war is beginning in earnest. The back room dealings and shadowed alleyway fightings from the first season are over and people are picking sides as the war takes the main stage for all to see. These are where the main players’ allegiances are when the second season ramps up. Team Black: Rhaenyra Targaryen Daemon Targaryen Rhaenys Targaryen Lord Corlys “The Sea Snake” Velaryon Jacaerys “Jace” Velaryon Baela Targaryen Rhaena Targaryen Mysaria – “The White Worm” Erryk Cargylle Team Green: Alicent Hightower Otto Hightower Aegon II Targaryen Helaena Targaryen Aemond Targaryen Ser Criston Cole Larys Strong Tyland Lannister Borros Baratheon Arryk Cargylle",

Red lights visible to the candidates will flash when they have five seconds left, and turn solid red when time has expired. And each man’s microphone will be muted when it is not his turn to speak. The candidates will get a breather during two commercial breaks, according to debate rules provided by CNN to the campaigns and reviewed by The New York Times, but they will be barred from huddling with advisers while off the air. The first presidential debate of the 2024 cycle is less than two weeks away, and both campaigns are racing to prepare for the first showdown sponsored directly by a television network in more than a generation. The 90-minute contest in Atlanta on June 27 is circled as one of the most consequential moments on this year’s campaign calendar, as Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump will outline their sharply contrasting visions for the nation, appearing together for the first time since their last debate, in October 2020. The two men are readying themselves for the debate in ways almost as different as their approaches to the presidency itself. The Biden operation is blocking off much of the final week before the debate, after he returns from Europe and a California fund-raising swing, for structured preparations. Mr. Trump has long preferred looser conversations, batting around themes, ideas and one-liners more informally among advisers. He held one session at the Republican National Committee headquarters this past week.",

                    "text": "There will be no opening statements. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will each have two minutes to answer questions — followed by one-minute rebuttals and responses to the rebuttals. Red lights visible to the candidates will flash when they have five seconds left, and turn solid red when time has expired. And each man’s microphone will be muted when it is not his turn to speak. The candidates will get a breather during two commercial breaks, according to debate rules provided by CNN to the campaigns and reviewed by The New York Times, but they will be barred from huddling with advisers while off the air. The first presidential debate of the 2024 cycle is less than two weeks away, and both campaigns are racing to prepare for the first showdown sponsored directly by a television network in more than a generation. The 90-minute contest in Atlanta on June 27 is circled as one of the most consequential moments on this year’s campaign calendar, as Biden and Trump will outline their sharply contrasting visions for the nation, appearing together for the first time since their last debate, in October 2020. The two men are readying themselves for the debate in ways almost as different as their approaches to the presidency itself. The Biden operation is blocking off much of the final week before the debate, after he returns from Europe and a California fundraising swing, for structured preparations. Trump has long preferred looser conversations, batting around themes, ideas and one-liners more informally among advisers. He held one session at the Republican National Committee headquarters this past week. Trump and Biden plainly do not like each other. The former president calls the current president the worst in American history. The current president calls his predecessor a wannabe dictator who threatens democracy itself. Four years ago, in their first encounter, Trump trampled over his rival’s talking time — the former president has since admitted privately that he was too aggressive — with Biden scolding him, “Will you shut up, man?” The rules circulated by CNN warn that this time, “moderators will use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion.” And then there is this: “Microphones will be muted throughout the debate except for the candidate designated to speak.” It is not clear how muted microphones will work in practice — whether the types of memorable moments (Al Gore’s sighs or Barack Obama’s “you’re likable enough” aside to Hillary Clinton) that have defined past debates will be lost entirely. The candidates will appear without a live audience and at lecterns determined by a coin flip. The unusually deep personal animosity between the two men is both an X factor for the debate and a key consideration for their strategies. The Trump campaign thinks a winning approach is exposing Biden being Biden; the Biden campaign sees a winning debate as letting Trump be Trump. Both men will be rusty. Neither has debated since their last clash in 2020, the longest drought since general-election debates became a regular part of American campaigns in 1976. For Biden, the preparation process will be overseen by Ron Klain, his first White House chief of staff, who filled the same role for his 2020 debates and his 2012 vice-presidential debate. Klain compiles what topics are likely to come up and what prospective answers could be, according to people who have been involved in past planning sessions. Bruce Reed, the White House deputy chief of staff, has in recent weeks been collecting materials on the two candidates’ policy contrasts for Biden to study. If past is prologue, Biden will use the early meetings to hash out how he wants to answer various questions. In later sessions, he is expected to rehearse with a stand-in opponent. In 2020, Bob Bauer, a Democratic lawyer who has served as Biden’s personal lawyer and is married to Anita Dunn, a top White House adviser, played the role of Trump; it is unclear if he will do so again in 2024. “The goal is no surprises,” said Kate Bedingfield, a former White House communications director who was involved in Biden’s 2020 debate preparations. “In some ways, you have to be prepared for the unimaginable. So the aim of the process is to acclimate President Biden to the idea that some really awful things may come out of Donald Trump’s mouth.” One major question is whether Trump brings up Hunter Biden, the president’s son, whom Trump went after in 2020 and who was just convicted on felony gun charges. Another is how Biden addresses the fact that Trump himself is now a felon, convicted in New York of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal that threatened his 2016 campaign. Klain has long worked to prepare Biden for attacks on his family. In 2012, when Klain ran Biden’s vice-presidential debate preparations, Chris Van Hollen, at the time a Maryland congressman who was playing the role of Paul Ryan, was asked to make a series of personal digs. “You have to prepare for someone who is going to hit below the belt,” said Van Hollen, now a U.S. senator. “In that earlier debate with Paul Ryan, it was a low probability. In this case, it is 100% that Donald Trump will hit below the belt.” For his part, Trump has never consented to anything resembling traditional, rigorous debate preparation, and this election appears no exception. He has often said that he is at his best when improvising. “He views his rallies as debate prep,” said Marc Lotter, who was an aide on Trump’s 2020 campaign and now works for a conservative nonprofit group. The challenge for Trump, Lotter said, will be to tighten answers to a time limit. “If they’re literally going to cut your mic, you’ve got to hit your marks,” he said. Often, campaigns spend the run-up to debates puffing up their opponents and their debating skills. But Trump’s relentless accusations that Biden is mentally diminished have only dampened expectations for the president. Trump’s close inner circle has so far engaged in fairly limited debate preparation, including the recent meeting at the Republican National Committee headquarters, which included Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Eric Schmitt of Missouri. Jason Miller, a senior Trump adviser who has taken a leading role in organizing the discussions, said that Trump’s speeches demonstrated “elite stamina” and that the former president “does not need to be programmed by staff.” Trump’s aides are not expected to hold formal role-playing sessions that replicate the debate and include somebody acting as Biden. “We have conversations,” Chris LaCivita, one of Trump’s campaign managers, explained to reporters this month in Las Vegas. Asked who might stand in for the role of the president, he replied, “Joe Biden is going to play Joe Biden.” Trump has argued that he is taking on not just Biden but also a television network in CNN that he says is hostile to him. “CNN is the enemy,” he said on a podcast this past week, mocking one of the two moderators, Jake Tapper, as “Fake Tapper.” (Tapper will be joined by Dana Bash.) Still, he predicted the network would be “as fair as they can be.” The Biden team has made clear what topics it would like the moderators to focus on. In a “road to Atlanta” memo last month, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, the president’s campaign chair, wrote that he wanted to talk about abortion, democracy and some of the specifics of Trump’s economic plans, including tax cuts for wealthier Americans. Trump’s team believes he will have one key advantage that he did not have four years ago: an unpopular Biden record to attack. Trump wants to focus on inflation, the fact that major conflicts in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip began during Biden’s tenure and record border crossings that the former president blames for domestic crime. The 90 minutes of debate time will begin, according to the rules circulated by CNN, once the first question is answered. Up to five minutes are designated per question: two minutes for the opening answer, a one-minute rebuttal, a one-minute response to the rebuttal and an extra minute to be used at the discretion of the moderators. Each candidate will also be allowed a two-minute closing statement. Biden’s team believes it has already won a major victory by persuading the Trump campaign to agree to move the first debate to late June from September. The Biden campaign believes that once voters fully grapple with the prospect of a return to power by Trump, Biden’s lagging poll numbers will improve. Presidential debates remain singular moments in American campaigns. In 2020, more than 73 million viewers tuned in to the first debate. But increasingly, debates are not just about the live viewership but about the clips packaged afterward, as well as the punditry and expectations in the days beforehand. The Biden campaign asked Gov. Gavin Newsom of California to serve as one of its surrogates in the so-called spin room after the debate in Atlanta. Plenty of Democrats are nervous about how Biden will perform. But the president is not said to be one of them. “I can assure you, Joe Biden is not scared of Donald Trump,” Klain said in an appearance on MSNBC this year. One fear among Biden’s team and supporters is that he spends too much time talking about his record and not enough time attacking Trump. “The challenge for all incumbents in the debates is to not spend the whole time talking about their record,” said Jim Messina, the campaign manager for Obama’s 2012 campaign. ——— This article originally appeared in The New York Times.",

                    "text": "Nick Mavar, a deckhand who appeared on 17 seasons of Deadliest Catch, died Thursday at age 59. A representative for the Bristol Bay Borough Police Department confirmed Mavar’s death to Entertainment Weekly. Authorities told PEOPLE that they received a 911 call from a boatyard in Naknek, Alaska, reporting a medical emergency. The outlet noted that emergency personnel transported Navar to Camai Medical Center \"while providing life saving measures” before the medical staff pronounced him dead. Police also told PEOPLE that an investigation is underway. A rep for Discovery did not immediately respond to EW's request for comment. Mavar made his Deadliest Catch debut in 2005, when he could be seen working as a deckhand on the Northwestern in the very first episode of Discovery’s crab fishing reality series. He appeared on 98 episodes across 16 years, serving as the right hand man for Captain Sig Hansen on that same vessel. Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more. In December 2020, Mavar was airlifted to a hospital after his appendix ruptured during filming. Doctors then discovered a cancerous tumor within his appendix, and he did not return to the show following his diagnosis. His final episode aired during season 17 the following year. Mavar later sued the owners of the Northwestern over the incident, alleging they provided insufficient medical care for the crew. Those owners then sued the production company Original Productions, Inc. and the show’s medical provider Trifecta Solutions, claiming there was “failure to have an adequate plan in place” for medical coverage during the pandemic. The news of Mavar's death comes in the wake of fellow Deadliest Catch star Captain “Wild” Bill Wichrowski sharing his prostate cancer diagnosis in the season 20 premiere of the show. Nick McGlashan, Wichrowski’s deck boss on the Summer Bay, died in 2020. Another deckhand, Mahlon Reyes, died in 2020 after suffering a heart attack at 38. Mavar’s nephew Jake Anderson was also part of the Deadliest Catch family, serving first as a greenhorn on the Northwestern before graduating to deckhand and eventually becoming the captain of the Saga.",

                    "text": "“Deadliest Catch” star Nick Mavar has died. He was 59 years old. Bristol Bay Police Chief Jeffrey Eldie told Deadline that the Croatia native suffered a medical emergency at a boatyard in Naknek, Alaska, on Thursday. The F/V Northwestern deckhand was then transported to a local hospital where he later died of natural causes, the Police Chief said. He is survived by his wife, Julie Mavar, whom he went public with in August 2021. Nick rose to fame when he appeared in the Discovery Channel series, which chronicles the lives of commercial crab fishermen as they face harsh working conditions, between 2005 and 2021. He also starred in the “Deadliest Catch: Siberian Winter” and “Deadliest Catch: The Bait” spinoffs. Nick left the show after he ruptured his appendix while onboard during a December 2020 expedition. Following the incident, he sued one of the boat owners Sig Hansen and his wife, claiming that there wasn’t a plan in place for him to get proper medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. In turn, Hansen sued the show’s production company for the same reason. His death comes four years after his co-star Nick McGlashan died at 33. He starred in the reality series from 2013 to 2020. And a couple of months before, deckhand Mahlon Reyes died of a heart attack. He was 38 years old. The coroner ruled Reyes’ death an accident following an acute cocaine intoxication.",

Chad Gable Chad Gable and Sami Zayn played cat-and-mouse early on in the match. When Zayn had a moment with Otis, fans really came alive. Chad Gable worked over Sami Zayn’s surgically repaired shoulder throughout this match. There was a great spot where Zayn and Gable kept countering each others’ attempt at a German Suplex until, finally, Zayn hooked Gable in a modified German suplex. At one point, Maxxine thought about hitting Zayn with the WWE Intercontinental Title, but decided against it. Gable derided Maxxine for balking, but managed to dodge a Helluva Kick at the last second and counter with a Chaos Theory Suplex. After a nearfall, Gable went right back to lambasting Maxxine, but Otis stood up for him. Zayn accidentally dove onto Otis on the outside. Back in the ring, a rumbling Scotland crowd prepared for another Helluva Kick, but Zayn’s bad leg gave way. Gable accidentally chop-blocked Maxxine in her injured leg, further infuriating Otis. As Otis decided whose side to take, he ultimately carried Maxxine out of the arena as the crowd cheered. This opened the door for a Helluva Kick and the win for Sami Zayn. Sami Zayn vs. Chad Gable Grade: A Bayley Def. Piper Niven The crowd was clearly tired after an emotionally taxing match between Zayn and Gable. They were very subdued for hometown hero Piper Niven’s entrance, but gave the same lack of energy to Bayley. On her way to the ring, Bayley could be heard saying “I know you’ve got something left!” Once this match got started, fans were fully behind Piper with chants of “let’s go Piper.” There were also the mandatory “Hey Bayley” chants that happen in the UK. Chelsea Green was kicked out from ringside after putting her hands on Charles Robinson. After a Bayley-to-Belly from the top rope, Chelsea Green ran down in a Rey Mysterio mask, causing a distraction. This was a highly physical match with quite a few close calls and awkward landings, but these spots enhanced the match as they made the moves look more painful. Bayley won the match with a rollup, and it led to a deflated reaction from fans with “boo’s” mixed in. After Bayley’s win, she left the ring to give Niven the stage. A breakup with Chelsea Green can’t be too far behind. Bayley vs. Piper Niven Grade: B Damian Priest Def. Drew McIntyre Drew McIntyre was played out to “The Pride of Scotland” and fans went absolutely nuts for his entrance. McIntyre seemed overcome with emotion while on his way to the ring. McIntyre made a babyface entrance as he slapped hands with fans and even absconded a Scottish flag from the crowd. Fans went over 100 decibels cheering for McIntyre. McIntyre wore a “K” on his wrist in honor of his wife, who has been dealing with health issues in recent weeks. Wade Barrett said “if Drew McIntyre wins tonight, he’s British. If he loses, he’s Scottish.” Damian Priest went for a dive over the top rope and accidentally got his foot caught between the ropes. It looked gnarly, but McIntyre adapted perfectly and stomped on Priest, leaving him trapped in the ropes. Damian Priest hit a hurricanrana on McIntyre, but McIntyre immediately followed up with a Claymore Kick on Priest. It was a fantastic nearfall. After a ref bump, Drew McIntyre hit another Claymore Kick on Damian Priest. He pinned Priest and got a visual seven-count. Finally, a referee came down to count—it was CM Punk. Punk counted to two and kicked McIntyre in the groin. Priest hit South of Heaven for the win. The crowd was pissed. Drew McIntyre vs. Damian Priest Grade: B Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

                    "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Cody Rhodes once again defeated AJ Styles at WWE Clash at the Castle in Glasgow, Scotland. (Credit: ... [+] WWE/Getty Images) Getty Images WWE Clash at the Castle 2024 was a memorable event for the fans in Glasgow, one highlighted by the return of CM Punk, a big loss for Drew McIntyre and another successful title defense for Cody Rhodes. At WWE’s latest international event, four Scottish superstars entered the night with aspirations of winning a major title. However, it was only the pairing of Alba Fyre and Isla Dawn who left the OVO Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF Hydro arena wearing gold after the duo won a triple threat match to become the new WWE Women’s Tag Team Champions. While Clast at the Castle featured a number of big moments, like Fyre and Dawn’s big hometown win, overall the show was a step down from other recent overseas shows such as Backlash France. Some shortsighted creative calls—and disappointing matches—resulted in more questions than answers about the short-term and long-term futures of some of WWE’s biggest stars. Here are the full results for the show: Cody Rhodes defeated AJ Styles in an “I Quit” match to retain the WWE Championship Isla Dawn and Alba Fyre won the WWE Women’s Tag Team titles by defeating Jade Cargill and Bianca Belair and the duo of Zoey Stark and Shayna Baszler in a triple threat match Sami Zayn beat Chad Gable to retain the Intercontinental Championship Bayley defeated Piper Niven to remain the WWE Women’s Champion Damian Priest retained the World Heavyweight Championship against Drew McIntyre And let’s take a look at some of the most important highlights and takeaways from a newsworthy Clash at the Castle 2024 event. ForbesWWE Clash At The Castle 2024 Results: Cody Rhodes Makes AJ Styles QuitBy Blake Oestriecher MORE FOR YOU Paraiso Miami Swim Week Makes Waves Apple’s New iPhone Function When Your Battery Dies Beats Samsung And Google Robert Plant And Alison Krauss Offer Up Magical Evening On Stage Outside Chicago Cody Rhodes Vs. Solo Sikoa The Likely Direction For WWE Championship Rhodes defeated Styles in an “I Quit” match to retain the WWE Championship—just as expected. Perhaps the biggest story coming out of that match wasn’t the match itself but rather what happened afterward. As Rhodes made his exit following his successful defense over Styles, he was confronted by Solo Sikoa and attacked by The Bloodline. Of course, Rhodes and The Bloodline have plenty of history, but this new incarnation of the faction—with Sikoa as its leader—is much different from the original stable. Sikoa, in the absence of Roman Reigns, is the group’s clear No. 1 star and is reportedly planned as a future opponent for Rhodes. Given Rhodes’ second decisive victory over Styles at Clash at the Castle and the lack of other non-Bloodline heels on SmackDown, Rhodes vs. Sikoa appears to be coming sooner rather than later. Expect that WWE Championship match either at Money in the Bank or SummerSlam but likely the latter. Jade Cargill And Bianca Belair Loss Hurts WWE Women’s Tag Team Division WWE pulled off quite the shocker when hometown heroes Fyre and Dawn won the WWE Women’s Tag Team Championship in Glasgow. That, of course, means that Cargill and Belair lost their titles roughly just six weeks after winning them. The glass half full outlook here would be that Cargill and Belair will continue to focus on tag team wrestling and pursue a second reign. However, since the WWE Women’s Tag Team Championship returned in 2019, there has been little to nothing to suggest that Belair and Cargill losing the belts is a good thing. WWE has, time and time again, united star-studded duos—like Becky Lynch and Lita, for example—in what appeared to be an effort to elevate the titles. In reality, though, their championship reigns proved to be the exception rather than the rule, with very little overall impact on the often poorly booked women’s tag team division. While Belair and Cargill could potentially stick around the division as challengers, WWE’s history would suggest that they’re instead going back to the singles scene—which could spell doom for Dawn, Fyre and the rest of the tag team division. WWE Drops The Ball With Chad Gable’s Loss To Sami Zayn Gable lost an Intercontinental title match. Stop if you’ve read that sentence before. Yes, WWE dropped the ball yet again with another big loss for Gable, who fell short against Zayn in Glasgow. The question is: why? Gable just re-signed with WWE and was seemingly set for a major championship reign. Instead, he—just as he’s done throughout 2024—failed in his quest to win the Intercontinental title. Whether he’s lost to Zayn or Gunther, this has been the running theme for Gable this year. When Gable was a babyface, those losses made sense. However, as a full-fledged heel who’s doing the best character work of his career, Gable was the ideal candidate to win the Intercontinental title at a time when his character is red hot. Yet, he lost again, and it makes you wonder why WWE is continuing to delay his title win—if he’s even going to win it at all. Despite Loss To Bayley, Piper Niven Proves She Belongs In Women’s Title Scene Piper Niven never really had a chance in her WWE Women’s Championship match against Bayley. She was there to give her hometown fans in Scotland a big moment—and then lose. But if WWE fans learned anything from Niven’s showing in Glasgow, it’s that the oft-overlooked star should be a mainstay in the women’s title picture. Niven and Bayley delivered a fantastic match at the latest WWE pay-per-view, with Niven looking like a formidable challenger and a possible future world champion. At a time when WWE’s women’s division has been hampered by injuries and other departures, now is the perfect time for the creative team to focus on stars who are typically overlooked. Given her strong character work and top-notch performance at Clash at the Castle, Niven’s recent push should be more than a one-off. She can talk, she can wrestle, and she can make the fans believe. Why not give her another chance? Drew McIntyre Vs. CM Punk Likely For WWE SummerSlam For the second time in as many tries, McIntyre lost a world title match at WWE Clash at the Castle. This time, however, it was thanks to interference from a returning CM Punk. During McIntyre’s title match against Priest, an inadvertent referee bump gave Punk the opportunity to—while disguised as a ref himself—hit McIntyre with a lowblow and allow Priest to retain his title. For McIntyre, that was yet another disappointing world title match outcome, but it wasn’t at all surprising. The clear and obvious direction for McIntyre has been a match with Punk, and with SummerSlam less than two months away, McIntyre vs. Punk should be one of the biggest matches on that event’s card. The unfortunate reality is that McIntyre had to lose to Priest in his home country in order to further his feud with Punk, which likely also sets up Gunther vs. Priest at SummerSlam after Gunther earned a title shot by winning the King of the Roung tournament. Where that leaves McIntyre’s title aspirations is anyone’s guess, and for now, his second major Clash at the Castle title loss is a tough pill for him—and his fans—to swallow.

                    "text": "R&B singer Angela Bofill has died. She was 70 years old. On Friday, June 14, a rep for the performer, whose hits include \"This Time I'll Be Sweeter,\" \"I Try,\" and \"Angel of the Night,\" told PEOPLE she died Thursday morning at her daughter's home in Vallejo, Calif. News of her death was also shared on the artist's personal Facebook account in two separate posts on Friday. “ON BEHALF OF MY DEAR FRIEND ANGIE, I AM SADDENED TO ANNOUNCE HER PASSING ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 13TH,” the first post read, adding that her funeral will be held at St. Dominick's Church in California on June 28 at 1 p.m. A second update added, “JUST TO CLEAR UP THE CONFUSION. ON BEHALF OF SHAUNA BOFILL, HUSBAND CHRIS PORTUGUESE, WE ARE SADDENED BUT MUST REPORT THAT THE PASSING OF ANGELA YESTERDAY IS INDEED TRUE. WE THANK MELBA MOORE AND MAYSA FOR THEIR EARLY CONDOLENCES. THANKs FOR YOUR MANY POST.” The message was signed by her friend and manager, Rich Engel. In a December 2020 interview with Essence magazine, Bofill opened up about her life and career after rumors of her death had circulated online just months berfore. Laughing at the time, the “I’m on Your Side” singer said she found out about the death hoax after she received “a lot of calls confirming [if] it’s true.” “Friends calling up, ‘Oh my God, am I talking to the ghost of Angela Bofill?’ Thank God it’s not true,” she told the outlet. When asked how it felt to see the tributes pouring in, she replied, “You always must welcome love.” “I figured, ‘They really like me!’ [I’m just] laughing at it, really. It’s better to have a sense of humor,” the performer continued. She added that she had a will to live in order to see her grandchildren graduate from high school and college. Rumors of Bofill’s death in 2020 followed previous health complications after the singer had two strokes in 2006 and 2007. Speaking to The Denver Post in 2011 after a five-year hiatus to focus on her health, Bofill said she was happy to be back. “I feel happy performing again,” Bofill says. “I need crowd. In the blood, entertain. Any time a crowd comes to see me, I’m surprised. No sing no more and still people come. Wow. Impressed,” she told the publication. Engel also spoke with the Post at the time, recalling Bofill’s career during the 1970s and ‘80s. “She had a rare voice,” he said of his client and friend. “She could hit low notes and could hit high C. Her pitch was perfect.” Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. While discussing complications from her stroke, such as learning to walk again and her voice not being quite the same, Bofill still remained positive. “But my voice no sing. I rather not sing. Awful. Crack me up! Funny! I laugh about it. But very grateful — still living. Never take things for granted,” she said. Bowfill began recording in her teens and released her first studio album, Angie, in 1978. She continued recording new albums into the 1990s. Some of her other hit singles include \"Something About You,\" \"I'm on Your Side,\" \"Let Me Be the One,\" and \"I Just Wanna Stop.\"",

The Cuban-Puerto Rican musician died on Thursday at her daughter’s home in Vallejo, California, her friend and rep Rich Engel told People. A cause of death was not immediately available. Engel also shared the news of her passing on Bofill’s Facebook page in two separate posts. “ON BEHALF OF MY DEAR FRIEND ANGIE, I AM SADDENED TO ANNOUNCE HER PASSING ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 13TH,” he wrote in the first social media post, before sharing funeral information. In the second post, he added, “JUST TO CLEAR UP THE CONFUSION.

THANKS FOR YOUR MANY POSTS.” Angela Tomasa Bofill was born on May 2, 1964, in Brooklyn, to a Cuban father and Puerto Rican mother. As a teen, she sang in New York City’s All City Chorus, which featured the best singers from all high schools in the five boroughs. She received a bachelor of music degree from the Manhattan School of Music before beginning her professional career in the 1970s. In 1978, she was signed by GRP Records and released her first album, Angie, which was received well by critics and fans. It included one of her most iconic hits, “This Time I’ll Be Sweeter,” and the jazz composition, “Under the Moon and Over the Sky.” Less than a year later, she released her second album, Angel of the Night, which outperformed the previous one and included singles “What I What Wouldn’t Do (For the Love of You)” and “I Try,” which Bofill wrote. The artist’s early success with her albums made her one of the first Latina singers to make it into the R&B and jazz markets. Her third album, Something About You, was her first with Arista Records. Narada Michael Walden served as producer on it, and Clive Davis served as the executive. While “Holdin’ Out for Love” and title track “Something About You” made it into the R&B Top 40, the album didn’t perform as well as the previous two and didn’t succeed in its attempt to move her into mainstream music. Bofill and Walden collaborated on two more albums — Too Tough, which featured “I’m On Your Side,” and Teaser — before she moved over to Capitol Records in the 1980s and worked with Norman Connors on Intuition. Over the next several years, she recorded three more albums and provided backing vocals for Diana Ross and Kirk Whalum, as well as Connors’ Eternity. Prior to her death, the singer-songwriter suffered two strokes — one in 2006 and the other in 2007. Following the first one, she was paralyzed on her left side and required speech and physical therapy. While she did not have health insurance at the time to pay for her hospital bills, her manager organized a benefit concert to raise the funds she needed. Engel collaborated with New York radio stations Kiss FM and WFAN-FM for the show, which took place in Englewood, New Jersey. Bofill, who was inducted into the Women’s Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2023, took five years off from performing The Angela Bofill Experience after her second stroke, which resulted in her having speech and mobility impairment. While she couldn’t sing in the show, fans would come to hear her talk about her life, and other artists performed some of her hit songs. In 2011, she spoke with The Washington Post about her return to the stage. “I feel happy performing again,” she told the publication at the time. “I need crowd. In the blood, entertain. Any time a crowd comes to see me, I’m surprised. No sing no more and still people come. Wow. Impressed.” Bofill’s funeral will be held at St. Dominic’s Church in Vallejo on June 28 at 1 p.m., according to Engel’s Facebook post. She is survived by her husband, Chris, and daughter Shauna.",

Macron’s term is still on for three more years, and he would retain control over foreign affairs and defense regardless of the result of the French parliamentary elections.

In Paris, those who fear that the elections will produce France’s first far-right government since World War II will gather at Place de la Republique before marching through eastern Paris. The French Interior Ministry said 21,000 police and gendarmes would be deployed at protests across the country, with authorities expecting between 300,000 and 500,000 protesters nationwide. In the French Riviera city of Nice, protesters marched down Jean Médecin Avenue, the city’s main shopping street. An Associated Press journalist at the scene said she heard chants against the National Rally, its leader Jordan Bardella as well as against President Emmanuel Macron. Protest organizers said 3,000 took part, while the police put the number at 2,500. Nice is traditionally a conservative stronghold, but has over the past decade turned firmly in favor of Marine Le Pen’s National Rally and her far-right rival Eric Zemmour.

                    "text": "Commercial Content. 21+. Action Network is the official betting partner of the Chicago Tribune. The 2024 Stanley Cup Final had the makings for a classic series between two elite teams, with a generational talent, Connor McDavid, making his debut in the championship round of the NHL playoffs. However, it has yet to offer much excitement to this point, as the Panthers have owned every key moment, and as a result, a 3-0 series lead over the Oilers. Looking to become the 20th team to complete a sweep in the Cup Final, Florida is priced as a slight underdog in Saturday night’s Game 4 in Edmonton. Of the 28 previous teams to hold a 3-0 lead, 20 (71%) have won Game 4. Only the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs have ever come back from a 3-0 deficit to win the Stanley Cup. Does Edmonton have what it takes to become the second? If so, it has to start Saturday night. Here’s a prediction and pick for Game 4. Panthers vs. Oilers Game 4 odds Moneyline: Panthers +100, Oilers -120 Puck Line: Panthers +1.5 (-275), Oilers -1.5 (+220) Total: Over 5.5 (+100, Under 5.5 (-120) Odds via BetMGM Panthers vs. Oilers Game 4 prediction Due to a combination of the Oilers’ power rating entering the Cup Final and their analytical profile in the series, they are still priced as a slight favorite in this game. The Oilers own a 50.34% expected goal share in the series and have generated 22 more shots on goal than Florida has. It’s hard to say any of those stats mean the results will change at this point. The Panthers aren’t making nearly as many critical mistakes and are doing a drastically better job of bending but not breaking in their defensive zone. Most of Florida’s goals over the last two games came on full-fledged defensive breakdowns and were chances that would likely have gone in on any goaltender in the game. The Oilers’ defensive corps is looking like a significant flaw. Their star forwards have done a reasonably good job of driving play the other way, but once the Panthers spend a little time on the forecheck in the Oilers’ zone, it’s clear that mistakes are going to happen. Cody Ceci and Darnell Nurse have been garnering a ton of criticism in the playoffs and have had their share of critical breakdowns in this series. Due to their struggles, Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch has give his one dominant defense pairing of Mattias Ekholm and Evan Bouchard a hefty amount of minutes throughout the playoffs. The duo looks to be running out of gas at this point. When Florida has made more significant errors, Sergei Bobrovsky has been able to make saves as needed. He owns a +6.2 goals-saved-above-expected rating in the first three games and has made a late push to steal the Conn Smythe trophy as a result. Panthers vs. Oilers Game 4 pick By no means should we expect the Oilers to lay down and die here, but it’s difficult to find a reason why they are still a favorite in this matchup. There is some value betting the Panthers at anything better than even money. Pick: Panthers moneyline (+102 at FanDuel)",

Edmonton is looking to become the second team in NHL history, and first since the Toronto Maple Leafs back in 1942, to go from down 3-0 to Stanley Cup champs.The Florida Panthers can wrap up the sweep with a win at Rogers Place after winning Game 3 by a final score of 4-3 despite two third-period goals by the Oilers.Game 4 is scheduled for 8 p.m. ET on Saturday night on ABC.Despite its commanding 3-0 lead, Florida is a slight underdog at even money, while the Oilers are -120 at ESPN BET. The Over/Under is set at 5.5 (Over -- EVEN, Under -- -120).At DraftKings, the Panthers are -2500 to finish the job and raise the trophy, while Edmonton is +1300 to win the Stanley Cup.Stanley Cup Final Game 4 Betting AnalysisAfter two low-scoring games in Florida that were dominated by the Panthers and Sergei Bobrovsky, Florida built a 4-1 lead in Game 3. Edmonton made it respectable in the third period with goals from Philip Broberg and Ryan McLeod, but it was too little, too late.While Florida has controlled this series since it got underway, outscoring Edmonton 11-4 over Games 1, 2 and 3, the Oilers being slight favorites in Game 4 makes sense.We saw as recently as last night in the NBA how hard it is for any team to secure a trophy with a 4-0 sweep, especially on the road. More importantly, Edmonton should have some confidence after nearly rallying from down 4-1 to tie Game 3 on Thursday night. Oilers star Connor McDavid remains without a goal in this series, but he's up to three assists after helping set up both of Edmonton's late goals in Game 3.The Oilers look too overmatched to make this a series, but it's easy to see them finding a way to pull out Game 4 at home after finally finding some offense their last time out.That being said, Bobrovsky and Florida defensemen Gustav Forsling and Aaron Ekblad are unlikely to allow another three-goal performance by the Oilers, so stick with Under 5.5, which is 2-1 in this series. It's also worth noting here that dating back to the last three games of its conference finals series against the Rangers, five of Florida's last six games went under 5.5 goals.Picks: Edmonton moneyline (-120) at ESPN BET, Under 5.5 (-120) at ESPN BET",

                    "text": "A new war video from the battlefield in Ukraine appears to show a Russian tank falling into a crater when fleeing Ukrainian fire.The footage, released by Ukraine's 68th Jaeger Brigade, begins by showing drone video of an oncoming column of Russian armor. The vehicle at the front of the company is taken out by an explosion. Debris can be seen flying up into the air.Drones then attack the rest of the column of tanks and armored vehicles.One of the tanks, when crossing a field, drives into a large crater. A drone then targets the tank as at least one Russian soldier attempts to flee.A second video shows the tank engulfed in flames and exploding.Business Insider could not independently verify the video or the claims made in the caption.According to the video's caption, eight Russian tanks and eight infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) were destroyed. The video was taken in Pokrovsk in Ukraine's Donetsk region, one of the \"most tense\" areas along the front line, according to an update by Ukraine's General Staff.\"Ukrainian defense forces continue to make efforts to stabilize the situation and inflict major fire damage,\" the update said.Later on June 14, in comments to Ukrinform, Nazar Voloshyn, the spokesman for the Khortytsia grouping of forces, a formation of the Ukrainian Ground Forces, confirmed the brigade's claims.\"In the Pokrovsk axis, our Defense Forces destroyed eight Russian tanks and disabled two more. That's 10 in total. This makes up a tank company,\" he said.\"In addition, in this section of the front, during the said period, our defenders destroyed eight more armored fighting vehicles, two artillery systems, and four other vehicles (one more damaged).\"Voloshyn didn't specify when the video had been filmed but said 242 Russian troops had been killed or wounded during fighting in Pokrovsk.\"Our Ukrainian defenders did a good job yesterday and disposed of plenty of Russian hardware, and even more so Russian invaders along with their equipment,\" Voloshyn said.",

That includes money for energy assistance, repairing damaged energy infrastructure, helping refugees and strengthening civilian security in the wake of the aggression by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\"War is not our choice. It's Putin's choice,\" Zelenskyy said alongside Harris before their private meeting. \"And with this summit today, we will do everything we can to start moving toward real peace.\"Harris responded: \"I am here today to stand with Ukraine and the leaders from around the world in support of a just and lasting peace.\" She added that \"as we look forward to that peace and work toward that, the United States is committed to helping Ukraine rebuild.\"President Joe Biden was in Los Angeles after three days at the Group of Seven summit in Italy, where he held talks with Zelenskyy. Biden flew from Europe to California for a Saturday night fundraiser with Hollywood A-listers George Clooney and Julia Roberts.That decision to skip the summit on Ukraine spotlights the competing election-year demands facing Biden as he tries to balance a complicated domestic and foreign policy agenda while running against former President Donald Trump. It also reflects the growing profile Harris has found making the case for a second Biden term as the 2024 campaign heats up.\"Being vice president means you take a lot of hits for the team,\" said Matt Bennett, who served as an aide to former Vice President Al Gore. \"In the past, these moments on the global stage have been good for her. She looks presidential and very capable among world leaders.\"Zelenskyy, for months, publicly lobbied Biden and other world leaders to take part in the meeting, even warning that their absence could further embolden Putin in his 28-month war. Biden ultimately decided to send Harris and White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan to represent the administration.\"Skipping the summit is a missed opportunity for the president and for the United States,\" said Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington. \"That said, sending the vice president with the national security adviser is not exactly sending the junior varsity team.\"Biden has increasingly turned to Harris as he tries to reassemble the coalition of voters behind the victory over Trump — and one needed again to help win a second term. Harris has taken a more visible role in making the pitch for Biden to a diverse cross-section of the Democratic base.She visited an abortion clinic in Minneapolis to spotlight the administration's record on the issue. She has launched an effort to highlight economic development on Biden's watch, with a particular focus on minority communities.And she's crisscrossed the country to talk about issues such as marijuana legislation and gun violence as Biden's standing with that winning coalition from 2020 has shown signs of eroding. She squeezed in a visit to Atlanta on Friday to promote the administration's economic agenda before boarding Air Force Two for her red-eye flight to Switzerland.But like Biden, Harris has also seen her standing among Americans diminish. About 4 in 10 registered voters have a somewhat or very favorable view of Harris, according to a recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey. About half have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of her, and about 1 in 10 don't know enough to say. Her favorability ratings are similar to Biden.The Trump campaign needled Harris for her fill-in role in Switzerland, with spokesperson Karoline Leavitt saying the vice president has \"failed thus far at every task she has been given\" and \"will continue to embarrass our country at the Ukraine summit.\"Trump and his allies have occasionally gone after at Harris, suggesting that a vote for Biden is effectively a vote for Harris eventually becoming president.The White House, in explaining Biden's decision to skip the summit, noted that the president met twice with Zelenskyy in a week — on the sidelines of the G7 summit and the previous week while both were in France to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day.Russia was not invited to the Swiss summit. Putin on Friday promised to \"immediately\" order a cease-fire in Ukraine and begin negotiations if Kyiv started withdrawing troops from the four regions annexed by Moscow in 2022 and renounced plans to join NATO. Ukraine called Putin's proposal \"manipulative\" and \"absurd.\"Biden may have softened the disappointment over his absence from the Ukraine meeting with a series of announcements in recent weeks aimed at further bolstering Ukraine.G7 leaders this week announced a $50 billion loan package for Kyiv that will leverage interest and income from the more than $260 billion in frozen Russian assets.Biden and Zelenskyy on Thursday signed a security agreement that commits the U.S. over 10 years to continued training of Ukraine's armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, and greater intelligence sharing.Biden has approved sending Ukraine another Patriot missile system, something Zelenskyy says is desperately needed to defend against Russian strikes on Ukraine's power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets.And late last month, Biden eased restrictions that kept Ukraine from using American weaponry to strike inside Russia. This allows strikes into Russia for the limited purpose of defending the second-largest city of Kharkiv, which sits 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the border and has been bombarded with attacks launched from inside Russia.",

Russia’s aggression is also an attack on international rules and norms and the principles embodied in the U.N. Charter,” Harris said. She said the U.S. was committed to continuing ”to impose costs on Russia and we will continue to work toward a just and lasting peace,” reaffirming words she used at the start of her private meeting with Zelenskyy. For Zelenskyy, the gathering was a beginning toward finding a “real peace.” “The world majority definitely wants to live without bloody crises, deportations, and ecocides,” Zelenskyy said. “And so every nation that is not represented now and that shares the same values of the U.N.

Charter in deed and word, will be able to join our work at the next stages.” As the dozens of world leaders discussed how to bring peace to war-ravaged Ukraine, any hopes of a real breakthrough were muted by the absence of Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The combatants remain as far apart as they’ve ever been, with Kyiv sticking to its demands that Russia leave all Ukrainian territory it has seized and Moscow pressing on with its grinding offensive that has already taken large swaths of eastern and southern Ukraine. Putin on Friday laid out his demands for ending the war. His proposals didn’t include any new demands, and Kyiv blasted them as “manipulative” and “absurd.” The conference was attended by presidents or prime ministers from countries as far afield as Britain, Ecuador and Kenya, and several foreign ministers, including from Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Some key developing countries sent lower-level officials. China, which backs Russia, joined scores of countries that sat out the event. President Biden was in Los Angeles for a fundraiser after three days at the Group of 7 summit in Italy, where he held talks with Zelensky, and an earlier trip to Normandy for the 80th anniversary of D-day. When talk of a Swiss-hosted peace summit began last summer, Ukrainian forces had recently regained large tracts of territory, notably near the southern city of Kherson and the northern city of Kharkiv. Russian troops who control vast swaths of eastern and southern Ukraine have made territorial gains in recent months. The agenda for the two-day summit — nuclear safety; humanitarian assistance; a prisoner of war exchange; and global food security, which has been disrupted due to impeded shipments through the Black Sea — is short of the proposals laid out by Zelensky in late 2022. That peace plan called for the withdrawal of Russian troops from occupied Ukrainian territory, the cessation of hostilities and the restoration of Ukraine’s original borders with Russia, including Russia's withdrawal from occupied Crimea. Putin wants any peace deal to be built around a draft agreement negotiated in the early phases of the war that included provisions for Ukraine’s neutral status and limits on its armed forces, while delaying talks about Russian-occupied areas. Ukraine’s push to join NATO over the years has rankled Moscow. On Friday, Putin told Russian diplomats and senior lawmakers that he would “immediately” order a cease-fire and begin negotiations if Ukraine drops its bid to join NATO and starts withdrawing troops from four regions that Moscow illegally annexed in 2022. Although Putin's demands are a nonstarter for Ukraine, Kyiv is currently unable to negotiate from a position of strength, analysts say. “The situation on the battlefield has changed dramatically,” said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, noting that although Russia “can't achieve its maximalist objectives quickly through military means,” it is gaining momentum on the battlefield. “So a lot of countries that are coming to the summit would question whether the Zelensky peace formula still has legs,” he told reporters Wednesday. With much of the world focused on the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and national elections in 2024, Ukraine’s backers want to bring global attention back to Russia’s breach of international law and a restoration of Ukraine’s territory. The International Crisis Group, an advisory firm that works to end conflict, wrote this week that “absent a major surprise on the Bürgenstock,\" the event is “unlikely to deliver much of consequence.” “Nonetheless, the Swiss summit is a chance for Ukraine and its allies to underline what the U.N. General Assembly recognized in 2022 and repeated in its February 2023 resolution on a just peace in Ukraine: Russia’s all-out aggression is a blatant violation of international law,” it said. Experts said they would be looking closely at the wording of any outcome document or plans for a way forward. Swiss officials, aware of Russia's reticence about the conference, have repeatedly said they hope Russia can join the process one day, as do Ukrainian officials. As world leaders discussed a pathway to peace in Switzerland, the war ground on in Ukraine, where shelling killed at least three civilians and wounded 15 others on Friday and overnight into Saturday, regional officials said. Meanwhile, Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Russia’s southern Belgorod region, blamed Ukraine in a social media post for shelling Friday that struck a five-story apartment building in the town of Shebekino, killing five people. There was no immediate comment from Kyiv. Keaten and Madhani write for the Associated Press. Ken Moritsugu in Beijing and Joanna Kozlowska in London contributed to this report.",

                    "text": "Within 24 hours, President Joe Biden will have gone from the G7 Summit to George Clooney.Mr. Biden left Italy late Friday night after a meeting with world leaders and arrived in Los Angeles early Saturday morning ahead of a star-studded evening fundraiser with former President Barack Obama, talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, Clooney and actress Julia Roberts.The Biden-Harris campaign says they've already raised $28 million going into Saturday night's event, a record sum for a single Democratic fundraiser. It also eclipses the $26 million the Biden campaign raised from a March fundraiser in New York City with Biden, Obama and former President Bill Clinton. Saturday's star-studded affair will feature a moderated interview of Biden and Obama by Kimmel that is expected to be focused on health care. Kimmel has been a public advocate of the Affordable Care Act, passed by Obama and Biden, after his newborn son had open-heart surgery in 2017. Clooney and Roberts will serve as hosts of Saturday's event. Appearances from actors Jason Bateman, Jack Black, Kathryn Hahn and Sheryl Lee Ralph are also expected, along with an undisclosed musical guest. Other celebrities, such as Keegan-Michael Key, Connie Britton, Misha Collins, Jeri Ryan, Jonathan Del Arco, Mandana Dayani, Blake Cooper Griffin and Adam Met, will be in attendance, according to the Biden campaign. Prices for tickets at Saturday's event ranged from $250 to $500,000, though grassroots donors could chip in $20 to watch the fundraiser virtually. Hollywood actors have had a presence on the campaign trail in support of Biden in recent weeks. Robert De Niro took part in a May campaign press conference outside the lower Manhattan courthouse where former President Donald Trump's \"hush money\" trial was taking place. Ralph of \"Abbott Elementary\" campaigned with Vice President Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania, and Jane Fonda appeared at a campaign event in Reno, Nev. with first lady Jill Biden on Friday.The money comes at a time when the race is tight between Biden and Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. A CBS News poll from June found Mr. Biden up 1 point in the battleground states, a virtual tie. The Biden campaign says money raised Saturday will go to growing their grassroots operation (field offices, staffers) and towards paid media.\"This Saturday we are going to see an unprecedented and record-setting turnout from the media and entertainment world. The enthusiasm and commitment for Biden/Harris couldn't be stronger. We all understand this is the most important election of our lifetime,\" said Biden-Harris campaign co-chair and film producer Jeffrey Katzenberg. While Mr. Biden has held a sizeable cash advantage throughout most of the cycle, Mr. Trump has seen his own fundraising grow. His campaign says they raised $52.8 million in the 24 hours after he was convicted on 34 felony counts from his \"hush money\" trial.The Trump campaign says they also raised a record-breaking $50.5 million at an April fundraiser in Florida. Mr. Clooney's involvement in the fundraiser brought some intrigue after the Washington Post reported in June that he had called a White House advisor to air grievances with Biden's criticism of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which Clooney's wife Amal works on. Biden has criticized the ICC's application for arrest warrants of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant.Several days after, the Biden campaign sent out a fundraising text from Clooney. \"I'm not exaggerating when I say that this election is the fight of our lives,\" the text blast from Clooney reads. \"It's a choice between those who want to pull America back to the past, and those who want to move America into the future.\"",

The 34-year-old has only performed the track twice since its release. She played a piano version of the song in October 2016—six months after its debut—at the Formula 1 U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, Texas. Nearly four months later, the Grammy winner performed it on an acoustic guitar during a Super Saturday Night concert in Houston.",

                    "text": "This is what Swifties came for. Taylor Swift pleasantly surprised fans by playing an acoustic version of Calvin Harris and Rihanna’s “This Is What You Came For” during her second Liverpool, England Eras Tour concert Friday night. “Every single time I have an acoustic set, I’m always trying to think of things you might want to hear — maybe things that might be a little bit unexpected,” the 34-year-old global superstar explained before revealing the first surprise song of the night. “Let’s see how we did tonight.” Fans erupted in euphoric cheer as soon as she began performing the smash hit. She played a mashup of “This Is What You Came For” and “Gold Rush,” which is off her “Evermore” album. Her second surprise song mashup combined “The Great War” and “You’re Losing Me.” Swift plays two surprise songs every night at her Eras Tour, one usually on guitar and one usually on piano. The acoustic set allows the “Maroon” singer to dive into her impressive catalog of songs while giving fans something extra to look forward to during her three-hour show. The 14-time Grammy winner wrote “This Is What You Came For” with her then-boyfriend Harris, now 40. When it debuted in April 2016, she used the pseudonym Nils Sjöberg because she didn’t want her name to overshadow the song. Shortly after they broke up, TMZ reported she was behind the name. Harris later confirmed she wrote the lyrics and contributed some background vocals via an angry rant on X during which he accused her of trying to “tear” him down. (The rant is hidden as he disabled his X account upon learning that the “Karma” hitmaker sang their song in Liverpool). “I wrote under the name Nils Sjöberg because those are two of the most popular names of Swedish males. … And nobody knew for a while,” Swift recalled during a 2020 interview with Paul McCartney for Rolling Stone. While it’s not usually her top pick to perform, Swift previously played “This Is What You Came For” in October 2016 at the Formula 1 U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, Texas and at a Super Saturday Night performance in Houston in February 2017. Swift is currently touring Europe before wrapping up the Eras Tour in Canada in December. Although there was chatter she may extend it again, she confirmed during Thursday’s Liverpool performance that the tour will indeed wrap.",

                    "text": "Prince Louis is once again stealing the show at Trooping the Colour. The 6-year-old prince appeared with his family at King Charles' birthday parade in London on June 15, and he quickly won the internet's hearts again while watching the presentation from the Major General's Office overlooking Horse Guards' Parade. In a funny clip posted on X (formerly Twitter), Prince Louis was seen swaying his hips from side to side as he danced to the band's music. Although his moves seemed to get a laugh from mom Kate Middleton, his older sister Princess Charlotte seemed less than impressed! The 9-year-old princess appeared to tell Louis to \"stop\" as she exchanged words with him. In another cute moment, Prince Louis played with a curtain cord as he sat and chatted with Princess Kate, 42. Prince Louis was spotted in another clip shared on social media yawning on the balcony during the ceremony. He memorably let out a similarly big yawn at King Charles' coronation at Westminster Abbey on May 6, 2023. (Shortly after, he left the crowning ceremony for a little bit before rejoining his family for the carriage ride back to Buckingham Palace and balcony appearance after.) Prince Louis — who sported his go-to ensemble for royal events, shorts with knee socks paired with a blazer and tie — rode in a horse-drawn carriage with Princess Kate and siblings Prince George and Princess Charlotte for the procession through London, riding in the Glass Coach to shield them amid the gloomy weather. Built in 1881 and purchased for King George V’s coronation in 1911, the carriage has been used in many royal events and even brought royal brides to their weddings, including Princess Anne in 1973, Princess Diana in 1981 and Sarah Ferguson in 1986. Prince Louis and Princess Kate sat side-by-side facing forward while Prince George and Princess Charlotte sat across from them for the journey from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards' Parade. Prince William and Princess Kate's joint social media page posted an Instagram Reel of their arrival at the ceremony on June 15 as they headed into the horse-drawn carriage to the parade. “All set for The King’s Birthday Parade!” their team wrote in the caption. In the clip, Prince Louis waved as he waited with Princess Kate and his siblings to be seated in the carriage. Kate’s attendance at the Trooping the Colour marks her first public appearance since announcing her cancer diagnosis in March. The Princess of Wales’ appearance comes after she confirmed she would be attending the parade on June 15, as she shared a candid message on her health status and recovery amid chemotherapy following her cancer diagnosis. One of the youngest royal family members is known for showing off his playful personality at royal events. At Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2022, he brought charm and laughter to the festivities due to his enthusiastic waves, animated faces and interactions with older siblings. \"He's a cheeky monkey — a typical third child,\" someone who knows the family told PEOPLE following the celebration of Queen Elizabeth's 70 years on the throne. \"It's nice that the world got to see him enjoying himself.\" Even Prince William and Princess Kate couldn't help but acknowledge their son's scene-stealing behavior. The royal couple ended the four days of celebrations by sharing a social media post that said, \"We all had an incredible time, especially Louis…\" with the eyes emoji.",

But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well.\" She said her \"treatment is ongoing and will be for a few more months,\" later adding, \"I am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty.

                    "text": "A Los Angeles County firefighter was killed on Friday, June 14, when part of a burning front-loader exploded at a Littlerock quarry. Los Angeles County Fire Department crews responded around 2 p.m. to the quarry in the 7300 block of Pearblossom Highway in the community southeast of Palmdale on a report of a burning vehicle. County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said a short time after crews arrived, perhaps around 2:10 p.m., an explosion occurred, killing a 19-year veteran firefighter. His name was not immediately released. His body remained at the scene as of early evening, covered with an American flag. A second firefighter who was near the blast was taken to Antelope Valley Medical Center, but did not suffer any serious injuries and was being released from the hospital, Marrone said. “I don’t know how the fire started, and I don’t know what exploded,” Marrone said, noting that a thorough investigation will be conducted. Marrone said the firefighter who died was stationed in Palmdale. Marrone called him a “wonderful man. He was married. He’s a father. It’s just such a tragedy.” By late afternoon, the large front-loader was still burning and sending thick black smoke into the air. Fire crews kept their distance from the equipment, which was in an isolated dirt area and did not present any danger of spreading flames to other vehicles. Crews kept a water hose line on the vehicle, and most of the flames appeared to have been doused by early evening. Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger, whose district includes the Littlerock area, said in a statement her “heart is heavy. … “My deepest condolences to his family and the other firefighters at Station 93,” she said. “It’s a sobering reminder of the dangers our first responders face every day. “We owe them our steadfast support as they grapple with this loss,” the supervisor said. “I’m committed to ensuring our fire personnel are connected with needed mental-health support as they grieve.”",

                    "title": "Many Senate Republicans were done with Trump after Jan. 6. Now they want him back in the White House",
                    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Three years ago, Donald Trump had few friends left in the Senate. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell declared in a speech that Trump was “practically and morally responsible” for the violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by spreading “wild falsehoods” about election fraud and trying to overturn his reelection defeat. After the House impeached Trump for his actions, seven Republicans stood with Democrats and declared Trump guilty. He was acquitted, but several GOP senators — even some who still publicly supported him — distanced themselves from the former president. Many were certain his political future was over. But it wasn’t. Trump is now the party’s presumptive nominee to challenge President Joe Biden. And on Thursday, he returned to Capitol Hill to meet with Republicans — the first such official meetings since his presidency — to enthusiastic and near-unanimous support from the Senate GOP conference, including many of the same senators who condemned him for his actions as he tried to block President Joe Biden’s legitimate victory. McConnell shook his hand, multiple times, and gave him a fist bump. The hard feelings, and any memories of the violent end to his presidency, seemed to have faded completely. “I think that’s in the rearview mirror for most people,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said of the 2020 election. “There will always be tension there. But I think most Republicans really see President Trump as the only way to turn this country around. And they’re enthusiastic about the chance.” Republican senators’ embrace of the former president comes after years of ups and downs. With a few exceptions, senators have never backed him as consistently and as eagerly as their GOP counterparts in the House. But as he runs again, Senate Republicans are backing Trump more enthusiastically than ever. The zealous Senate support is partly rooted in self-interest. Republicans have a good shot at winning the Senate majority in November, and they know Trump’s support is key to doing that, especially in solidly Republican states like Ohio and Montana where Democratic incumbents are struggling to hold on. And they are already starting to talk about what they will do if Trump wins and they gain both chambers of Congress. House Speaker Mike Johnson visited a Senate GOP luncheon Wednesday to discuss the possibility of tax legislation, among other things, if Republicans win full control. “Our ability to get a majority in the Senate is intrinsically linked to Trump winning,” Republican. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said after the meeting with Johnson. “So we’re like, one team, one vision.” Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who is running to replace McConnell as GOP leader when he steps down from that post in November, said the party faces a “binary choice” between Trump and Biden. “There is no Plan B,” said Cornyn, who had called Trump “reckless” after the Capitol attack. “I think people know the strengths and weaknesses of both candidates. And for me, I think President Trump is clearly preferable.” Also, Cornyn added, “his support is going to be important in a lot of these states where he’s very popular, where we have Senate races.” It’s hardly the first time Republicans have returned to supporting Trump after attempting a clean break. The arguments, and the whiplash, are a familiar pattern. McConnell, for example, fully backed Trump in the days before he was elected in 2016, just weeks after the release of a decade-old tape in which Trump was caught on a hot mic bragging to a celebrity news anchor about grabbing women by their genitalia. McConnell had called Trump’s comments “repugnant and unacceptable in any circumstance.” Many other Republican senators had been cool to Trump on the campaign trail that year and were outraged by the tape. Utah Sen. Mike Lee, now one of Trump’s most loyal backers, recorded a video calling on Trump to step aside, saying he was a “distraction from the very principles that will help us win in November.” South Dakota Sen. John Thune, who is also running to replace McConnell, also called on Trump to withdraw from the race. But he later backtracked on those comments. Once he was elected, Republican senators publicly united behind Trump, aligned with him on policy and were elated by his conservative picks for the Supreme Court. Most of them defended him through the tumultuous investigations of his campaign’s ties to Russia and rarely criticized him, lest they might be called out by the president on social media and face conservative voters’ ire. After Trump lost his reelection, though, very few senators backed his false claims of fraud, especially after the courts rejected multiple lawsuits and the Electoral College certified the votes. Thune and Cornyn both criticized his efforts to overturn his defeat in Congress in the days before Jan. 6, with Thune saying he thought the plan would go down “like a shot dog.” Trump later said on Twitter that Thune was a “RINO,” or Republican in name only, whose “political career (is) over!!!” And after the violence of Jan. 6, few had nice words to say. “Count me out,” said Graham in the hours after Trump supporters violently beat police officers and ransacked the Capitol. “Enough is enough.” But in the weeks, months and years afterward, most of them softened — especially as several Trump allies were newly elected to the Senate and Trump faced several indictments that Republicans see as politically motivated. By early this year, most of the Senate GOP conference had endorsed his third run for the White House, including McConnell, Thune and Cornyn. By the time he was convicted in a hush money trial in New York late last month, he had a sweeping and united backing from the GOP Senate conference. “Now more than ever, we need to rally around @realdonaldtrump, take back the White House and Senate, and get this country back on track,” Cornyn said in a statement. Though he struck a positive note in Thursday’s Senate meeting, even praising McConnell at one point, Trump’s rhetoric hasn’t changed much. He still claims the 2020 election was stolen, calls the rioters who were imprisoned for violence on Jan. 6 “hostages” and says he will pardon them, and has consistently bashed the judges who are overseeing his trials. A handful of senators remain skeptical. Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, both of whom voted to convict Trump after Jan. 6, skipped the meeting with Trump. Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who also voted to convict, and Indiana Sen. Todd Young, who has declined to endorse the former president, both attended but would not answer questions from reporters afterward.

                    "text": "WASHINGTON — Three years ago, Donald Trump had few friends left in the Senate. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell declared in a speech that Trump was “practically and morally responsible” for the violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by spreading “wild falsehoods” about election fraud and trying to overturn his reelection defeat. After the House impeached Trump for his actions, seven Republicans stood with Democrats and declared Trump guilty. He was acquitted, but several GOP senators – even some who still publicly supported him – distanced themselves from the former president. Many were certain his political future was over. But it wasn’t. Trump is now the party’s presumptive nominee to challenge President Biden. And on Thursday, he returned to Capitol Hill to meet with Republicans – the first such official meetings since his presidency – to enthusiastic and near-unanimous support from the Senate GOP conference, including many of the same senators who condemned him for his actions as he tried to block Biden’s legitimate victory. McConnell shook his hand, multiple times, and gave him a fist bump. The hard feelings, and any memories of the violent end to his presidency, seemed to have faded completely. “I think that’s in the rearview mirror for most people,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said of the 2020 election. “There will always be tension there. But I think most Republicans really see President Trump as the only way to turn this country around. And they’re enthusiastic about the chance.” Republican senators’ embrace of the former president comes after years of ups and downs. With a few exceptions, senators have never backed him as consistently and as eagerly as their GOP counterparts in the House. But as he runs again, Senate Republicans are backing Trump more enthusiastically than ever. The zealous Senate support is partly rooted in self-interest. Republicans have a good shot at winning the Senate majority in November, and they know Trump’s support is key to doing that, especially in solidly Republican states like Ohio and Montana where Democratic incumbents are struggling to hold on. And they are already starting to talk about what they will do if Trump wins and they gain both chambers of Congress. House Speaker Mike Johnson visited a Senate GOP luncheon Wednesday to discuss the possibility of tax legislation, among other things, if Republicans win full control. “Our ability to get a majority in the Senate is intrinsically linked to Trump winning,” Republican. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said after the meeting with Johnson. “So we’re like, one team, one vision.” Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who is running to replace McConnell as GOP leader when he steps down from that post in November, said the party faces a “binary choice” between Trump and Biden. “There is no Plan B,” said Cornyn, who had called Trump “reckless” after the Capitol attack. “I think people know the strengths and weaknesses of both candidates. And for me, I think President Trump is clearly preferable.” Also, Cornyn added, “his support is going to be important in a lot of these states where he’s very popular, where we have Senate races.” It’s hardly the first time Republicans have returned to supporting Trump after attempting a clean break. The arguments, and the whiplash, are a familiar pattern. McConnell, for example, fully backed Trump in the days before he was elected in 2016, just weeks after the release of a decade-old tape in which Trump was caught on a hot mic bragging to a celebrity news anchor about grabbing women by their genitalia. McConnell had called Trump’s comments “repugnant and unacceptable in any circumstance.” Many other Republican senators had been cool to Trump on the campaign trail that year and were outraged by the tape. Utah Sen. Mike Lee, now one of Trump’s most loyal backers, recorded a video calling on Trump to step aside, saying he was a “distraction from the very principles that will help us win in November.” South Dakota Sen. John Thune, who is also running to replace McConnell, also called on Trump to withdraw from the race. But he later backtracked on those comments. Once he was elected, Republican senators publicly united behind Trump, aligned with him on policy and were elated by his conservative picks for the Supreme Court. Most of them defended him through the tumultuous investigations of his campaign’s ties to Russia and rarely criticized him, lest they might be called out by the president on social media and face conservative voters’ ire. After Trump lost his reelection, though, very few senators backed his false claims of fraud, especially after the courts rejected multiple lawsuits and the Electoral College certified the votes. Thune and Cornyn both criticized his efforts to overturn his defeat in Congress in the days before Jan. 6, with Thune saying he thought the plan would go down “like a shot dog.” Trump later said on Twitter that Thune was a “RINO,” or Republican in name only, whose “political career (is) over!!!” And after the violence of Jan. 6, few had nice words to say. “Count me out,” said Graham in the hours after Trump supporters violently beat police officers and ransacked the Capitol. “Enough is enough.” But in the weeks, months and years afterward, most of them softened – especially as several Trump allies were newly elected to the Senate and Trump faced several indictments that Republicans see as politically motivated. By early this year, most of the Senate GOP conference had endorsed his third run for the White House, including McConnell, Thune and Cornyn. By the time he was convicted in a hush money trial in New York late last month, he had a sweeping and united backing from the GOP Senate conference. “Now more than ever, we need to rally around @realdonaldtrump, take back the White House and Senate, and get this country back on track,” Cornyn said in a statement. Though he struck a positive note in Thursday’s Senate meeting, even praising McConnell at one point, Trump’s rhetoric hasn’t changed much. He still claims the 2020 election was stolen, calls the rioters who were imprisoned for violence on Jan. 6 “hostages” and says he will pardon them, and has consistently bashed the judges who are overseeing his trials. A handful of senators remain skeptical. Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, both of whom voted to convict Trump after Jan. 6, skipped the meeting with Trump. Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who also voted to convict, and Indiana Sen. Todd Young, who has declined to endorse the former president, both attended but would not answer questions from reporters afterward. South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, whom Trump once called a “jerk” after he said that the former president didn’t win reelection, also attended the meeting and has endorsed him. He said Republicans had a good working relationship with Trump until the 2020 election, but “many of us that have disagreed with some of the analysis that was done.” Senators will have to “work our way though that issue,” Rounds said, by concentrating on where they can agree. “We’re going to focus on what we need to do to fix the economy, bring back a strong defense, try to put out a lot of the fires that are going on around the world, and focus on the policies,” he said. « Previous",

                    "text": "DALLAS (AP) — There were two options for the Dallas Mavericks. Pack for Boston, or pack for vacation. Boston awaits. These NBA Finals are not over, thanks to one of the biggest blowouts in title-round history. Luka Doncic scored 25 of his 29 points in the first half, Kyrie Irving added 21 and the Mavericks emphatically extended their season on Friday night, fending off elimination with a 122-84 rout of the Celtics in Game 4. The 38-point final margin was the third-biggest ever in an NBA Finals game, behind only Chicago beating Utah 96-54 in 1998 and the Celtics beating the Los Angeles Lakers 131-92 in 2008. “It’s real simple. We don’t have to complicate this. This isn’t surgery,” Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. “Our group was ready to go. They were ready to celebrate and we made a stand. We were desperate. We’ve got to continue to keep playing that way. They’re trying to close the door. The hardest thing in this league is to close the door when you have a group that has nothing to lose. Tonight, you saw that.” The Mavs’ stars were done by the end of the third quarter, with good reason. It was all Dallas from the outset, the Mavs leading by 13 after one quarter, 26 at the half and by as many as 38 in the third before both sides emptied the benches. Before Friday, the worst NBA Finals loss for the 17-time champion Celtics was 137-104 to the Lakers in 1984. This was worse. Much worse, at times. Dallas’ biggest lead in the fourth was 48 — the biggest deficit the Celtics have faced all season. The Celtics still lead the series 3-1, and Game 5 is in Boston on Monday. “Preparation doesn’t guarantee an automatic success,” Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. “I thought we had a great process. I thought we had a great shootaround. Thought we had a great film session yesterday. I thought the guys came out with the right intentions. I just didn’t think it went our way, and I thought Dallas outplayed us. They just played harder.” The loss — Boston’s first in five weeks — snapped the Celtics’ 10-game postseason winning streak, longest in franchise history, plus took away the chance they had at being the first team in NBA history to win both the conference finals and the finals in 4-0 sweeps. Jayson Tatum scored 15 points, Sam Hauser had 14 while Jaylen Brown and Jrue Holiday each finished with 10 for the Celtics. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 15 points, all in the fourth quarter, and Dereck Lively II had 11 points and 12 rebounds for Dallas. It was Lively who provided the hint that it was going to be a good night for the Mavs in the early going. He connected on a 3-pointer — the first of his NBA career — midway through the first quarter, a shot that gave the Mavs the lead for good. They were off and running. And kept running. “It doesn’t change anything,” Doncic said. “Like I said in the beginning of this series, it’s the first to four. And we’re going to believe until the end. We’re just going to keep going. I have big belief in this team that we can do it.” It was 61-35 at the half and Dallas left a ton of points unclaimed in the opening 24 minutes as well. The Mavs went into the break having shot only 5 of 15 from 3-point range, 10 of 16 from the foul line — and they were in total control anyway. “I think winning is hard. I think winning at any game is hard. But winning Game 4 of the NBA Finals is pretty damn hard,” Holiday said. “I think they came out desperate and I think they punched us in the mouth, and we couldn’t kind of recover the way we wanted to.” The first-half lowlights for Boston were many, some of them historic: — The 35 points represented the Celtics’ lowest-scoring total in a half, either half, in Mazzulla’s two seasons as coach. — The 26-point halftime deficit was Boston’s second biggest of the season. The Celtics trailed Milwaukee by 37 at the break on Jan. 11, one of only eight instances in their first 99 games of this season where they trailed by double figures at halftime. — The halftime deficit was Boston’s largest ever in an NBA Finals game, and the 35-point number was the second-worst by the Celtics in the first half of one. They managed 31 against the Lakers on June 15, 2010, Game 6 of the series that the Lakers claimed with a Game 7 victory. Teams with a lead of 23 or more points at halftime, even in this season where comebacks looked easier than ever before, were 76-0 this season entering Friday night. Make it 77-0 now. Doncic’s jersey number, coincidentally enough. The Celtics surely were thinking about how making a little dent in the Dallas lead to open the second half could have made things interesting. Instead, the Mavs put things away and fast; a 15-7 run over the first 4:32 of the third pushed Dallas’ lead out to 76-42. Whatever hope Boston had of a pulling off a huge rally and capping off a sweep was long gone. Mazzulla pulled the starters, all of them, simultaneously with 3:18 left in the third and Dallas leading 88-52. “I expect us to be much better on Monday,” Celtics center Al Horford said. The Mavs still have the steepest climb possible in this series — no team has successfully rallied from 3-0 down in NBA history — but the first step is done. “We have nothing to lose,” Kidd said. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",

Before Friday, the worst NBA Finals loss for the 17-time champion Celtics was 137-104 to the Lakers in 1984. This was worse. Much worse, at times. Dallas’ biggest lead in the fourth was 48 — the biggest deficit the Celtics have faced all season. The Celtics still lead the series 3-1, and Game 5 is in Boston on Monday. “Preparation doesn’t guarantee an automatic success,” Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. “I thought we had a great process. I thought we had a great shootaround. Thought we had a great film session yesterday. I thought the guys came out with the right intentions. I just didn’t think it went our way, and I thought Dallas outplayed us. They just played harder.” The loss — Boston’s first in five weeks — snapped the Celtics’ 10-game postseason winning streak, longest in franchise history, plus took away the chance they had at being the first team in NBA history to win both the conference finals and the finals in 4-0 sweeps. Jayson Tatum scored 15 points, Sam Hauser had 14 while Jaylen Brown and Jrue Holiday each finished with 10 for the Celtics. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 15 points, all in the fourth quarter, and Dereck Lively II had 11 points and 12 rebounds for Dallas. It was Lively who provided the hint that it was going to be a good night for the Mavs in the early going. He connected on a 3-pointer — the first of his NBA career — midway through the first quarter, a shot that gave the Mavs the lead for good. They were off and running. And kept running. “It doesn’t change anything,” Doncic said. “Like I said in the beginning of this series, it’s the first to four. And we’re going to believe until the end. We’re just going to keep going. I have big belief in this team that we can do it.” It was 61-35 at the half and Dallas left a ton of points unclaimed in the opening 24 minutes as well. The Mavs went into the break having shot only 5 of 15 from 3-point range, 10 of 16 from the foul line — and they were in total control anyway. “I think winning is hard. I think winning at any game is hard. But winning Game 4 of the NBA Finals is pretty damn hard,” Holiday said. “I think they came out desperate and I think they punched us in the mouth, and we couldn’t kind of recover the way we wanted to.” The first-half lowlights for Boston were many, some of them historic: The 35 points represented the Celtics’ lowest-scoring total in a half, either half, in Mazzulla’s two seasons as coach. The 26-point halftime deficit was Boston’s second biggest of the season. The Celtics trailed Milwaukee by 37 at the break on Jan. 11, one of only eight instances in their first 99 games of this season where they trailed by double figures at halftime. The halftime deficit was Boston’s largest ever in an NBA Finals game, and the 35-point number was the second-worst by the Celtics in the first half of one. They managed 31 against the Lakers on June 15, 2010, Game 6 of the series that the Lakers claimed with a Game 7 victory. Teams with a lead of 23 or more points at halftime, even in this season where comebacks looked easier than ever before, were 76-0 this season entering Friday night. Make it 77-0 now. Doncic’s jersey number, coincidentally enough. The Celtics surely were thinking about how making a little dent in the Dallas lead to open the second half could have made things interesting. Instead, the Mavs put things away and fast; a 15-7 run over the first 4:32 of the third pushed Dallas’ lead out to 76-42. Whatever hope Boston had of a pulling off a huge rally and capping off a sweep was long gone. Mazzulla pulled the starters, all of them, simultaneously with 3:18 left in the third and Dallas leading 88-52. “I expect us to be much better on Monday,” Celtics center Al Horford said. The Mavs still have the steepest climb possible in this series — no team has successfully rallied from 3-0 down in NBA history — but the first step is done. “We have nothing to lose,” Kidd said.",

Tepper passed away on Friday (June 14) from a heart attack at his home in New York City, according to a social media post by his wife, singer-songwriter Laura Cantrell. “Lost my good friend Jeremy Tepper last night,” Steven Van Zandt, guitarist in Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band and founder of Underground Garage, wrote on X (formerly Twitter). “An incredibly tragic loss so young. He ran my Outlaw Country station on SiriusXM brilliantly. It is actually quite a complicated format and he made it look easy. Our deepest love and condolences to Laura and his family and friends.” Born in 1963, the New York native graduated with a degree in journalism from NYU and served as the frontman for the band World Famous Blue Jays. During his career, Tepper founded independent country label Diesel Only Records and held A&R and marketing positions for CDuctive and eMusic.com. He was also a journalist, having previously served as editor of The Journal of Country Music and as a country music critic for Tower Records’ Pulse! magazine. In 2004, he joined Sirius as format manager of the radio giant’s Outlaw Country channel, which was created by Zandt, who served as its executive producer. The channel mixes music by country and Americana artists such as Waylon Jennings, Dale Watson, Dwight Yoakam, Johnny Cash and Lucinda Williams with rockers Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and the Band. Tepper’s two-decade run with Sirius also found him working on the Willie’s Roadhouse and Road Dog Trucking channels. “Jeremy Tepper, a beloved member of SiriusXM, profoundly influenced us with his unwavering dedication to music and innovative spirit,” SiriusXM wrote on X. “His contributions, in shaping Outlaw Country and Willie’s Roadhouse, are beyond measure. Our thoughts are with his loved ones during this time.” Tepper is survived by his wife, Cantrell, and their daughter, Bella.",

                    "text": "GENEVA -- The presidents of Ecuador, Ivory Coast, Kenya and Somalia will join many Western heads of state and government and other leaders at a conference this weekend aimed to plot out first steps toward peace in Ukraine – with Russia notably absent. Swiss officials hosting the conference say more than 50 heads of state and government, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, will join the gathering at the Bürgenstock resort overlooking Lake Lucerne. Some 100 delegations including European bodies and the United Nations will be on hand. Who will show up – and who will not – has become one of the key stakes of a meeting that critics say will be useless without the presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and is pushing ahead with the war. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is set to attend while Turkey and Saudi Arabia have dispatched their foreign ministers. Key developing countries like Brazil, an observer at the event, India and South Africa will be represented at lower levels. China, which backs Russia, is joining scores of countries that are sitting out the conference, many of whom have more pressing issues than the bloodiest conflict in far-away Europe since World War II. Beijing says any peace process needs to have the participation of both Russia and Ukraine, and has floated its own ideas for peace. Zelenskyy recently led a diplomatic push to draw in participants. Russian troops who now control nearly a quarter of Ukrainian land in the east and south have made some territorial gains in recent months. When talk of a Swiss-hosted peace initiative began last summer, Ukrainian forces had recently regained large swaths of territory, notably near the cities of southern Kherson and northern Kharkiv. Against the battlefield backdrop and diplomatic strategizing, summit organizers have presented three agenda items: nuclear safety, such as at the Russia-controlled Zaporizhzhia power plant; humanitarian assistance and exchange of prisoners of war; and global food security — which has been disrupted at times due to impeded shipments through the Black Sea. That to-do list, encapsulating some of the least controversial issues, is well short of proposals and hopes laid out by Zelenskyy in a 10-point peace formula in late 2022. Putin’s government, meanwhile, wants any peace deal to be built around a draft agreement negotiated in the early phases of the war that included provisions for Ukraine’s neutral status and limits on its armed forces, while delaying talks about Russia-occupied areas. Ukraine's push over the years to join the NATO military alliance has rankled Moscow. With much of the world’s focus recently on the war in Gaza and national elections in 2024, Ukraine’s backers want to return focus to Russia’s breach of international law and a restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity. The International Crisis Group, an advisory firm that works to end conflict, wrote this week that “absent a major surprise on the Bürgenstock,\" the event is “unlikely to deliver much of consequence.” “Nonetheless, the Swiss summit is a chance for Ukraine and its allies to underline what the U.N. General Assembly recognised in 2022 and repeated in its February 2023 resolution on a just peace in Ukraine: Russia’s all-out aggression is a blatant violation of international law,” it said.",

                    "text": "OBBÜRGEN, Switzerland — Dozens of world leaders converged on a Swiss resort Saturday to discuss how to bring peace to war-ravaged Ukraine, though any hopes of a real breakthrough were muted by the absence of Russia. Three years into the war, the combatants remain as far apart as they’ve ever been, with Kyiv sticking to its demands that Russia leave all Ukrainian territory it has seized and Moscow pressing on with its grinding offensive that has already taken large swaths of eastern and southern Ukraine. Despite Russia’s absence from the summit at the Bürgenstock resort overlooking Lake Lucerne, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy predicted at the outset that the talks would lead to “history being made.” “We have succeeded in bringing back to the world the idea that joint efforts can stop war and establish a just peace,” he said at a news conference alongside Swiss President Viola Amherd. While addressing the conference later, Zelenskyy said the summit could lay the groundwork for an eventual end to the conflict. “At the first peace summit, we must determine how to achieve a just peace, so that at the second, we can already settle on a real end to the war,” he said. PHOTOS: World leaders meet in Switzerland to discuss a Ukraine peace roadmap. Russia is notably absent The Swiss hosts said more than 50 heads of state and government would attend the gathering at the Bürgenstock resort overlooking Lake Lucerne. Some 100 delegations, including European bodies and the United Nations, were also expected. Who would and wouldn’t show up was a point of intrigue about a meeting that critics said would be pointless without the presence of Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Although his country didn’t attend, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday took the rare step of laying out his terms for ending the war. But his proposals didn’t include any new demands, and Kyiv blasted them as “manipulative” and “absurd.” The conference was attended by presidents or prime ministers from countries as far afield as Britain, Ecuador and Kenya, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, and several foreign ministers, including from Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, some key developing countries such as India, South Africa and Brazil, which was only observing the event, sent lower-level officials. China, which backs Russia, joined scores of countries that sat out the event. Beijing has said any peace process would require the participation of Russia and Ukraine, and has floated its own ideas for peace. Last month, China and Brazil agreed to six “common understandings” on a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, asking other countries to endorse them and play a role in promoting peace talks. The six points include an agreement to “support an international peace conference held at a proper time that is recognized by both Russia and Ukraine, with equal participation of all parties as well as fair discussion of all peace plans.” Russian troops who control vast swaths of eastern and southern Ukraine have made territorial gains in recent months. When talk of a Swiss-hosted peace summit began last summer, Ukrainian forces had recently regained large tracts of territory, notably near the southern city of Kherson and the northern city of Kharkiv. Against the battlefield backdrop and diplomatic strategizing, summit organizers have presented three agenda items: nuclear safety, including at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia power plant; humanitarian assistance and a prisoner of war exchange; and global food security, which has been disrupted at times due to impeded shipments through the Black Sea. That to-do list, which includes some of the least controversial issues, is well short of the proposals and hopes laid out by Zelenskyy in a 10-point peace formula in late 2022. That plan called for the withdrawal of Russian troops from occupied Ukrainian territory, the cessation of hostilities and the restoration of Ukraine’s original borders with Russia, including Russia’s withdrawal from occupied Crimea. Putin, meanwhile, wants any peace deal to be built around a draft agreement negotiated in the early phases of the war that included provisions for Ukraine’s neutral status and limits on its armed forces, while delaying talks about Russian-occupied areas. Ukraine’s push to join NATO over the years has rankled Moscow. On Friday, Putin told Russian diplomats and senior lawmakers that he would “immediately” order a cease-fire and begin negotiations if Ukraine drops its bid to join NATO and starts withdrawing troops from four regions that Moscow illegally annexed in 2022. Although Putin’s demands are a nonstarter for Ukraine, Kyiv is currently unable to negotiate from a position of strength, analysts say. “The situation on the battlefield has changed dramatically,” said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, noting that although Russia “can’t achieve its maximalist objectives quickly through military means,” it is gaining momentum on the battlefield. “So a lot of countries that are coming to the summit would question whether the Zelenskyy peace formula still has legs,” he told reporters Wednesday. With much of the world focused on the war in Gaza and national elections in 2024, Ukraine’s backers want to bring global attention back to Russia’s breach of international law and a restoration of Ukraine’s territory. The International Crisis Group, an advisory firm that works to end conflict, wrote this week that “absent a major surprise on the Bürgenstock,” the event is “unlikely to deliver much of consequence.” “Nonetheless, the Swiss summit is a chance for Ukraine and its allies to underline what the U.N. General Assembly recognized in 2022 and repeated in its February 2023 resolution on a just peace in Ukraine: Russia’s all-out aggression is a blatant violation of international law,” it said. Experts said they would be looking closely at the wording of any outcome document or plans for a way forward. Swiss officials, aware of Russia’s reticence about the conference, have repeatedly said they hope Russia can join the process one day, as do Ukrainian officials. As world leaders discussed a pathway to peace in Switzerland, the war ground on in Ukraine, where shelling killed at least three civilians and wounded 15 others on Friday and overnight into Saturday, regional officials said. Meanwhile, Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Russia’s southern Belgorod region, blamed Ukraine in a social media post for shelling Friday that struck a five-story apartment building in the town of Shebekino, killing five people. There was no immediate comment from Kyiv.",

                    "text": "OBBÜRGEN, Switzerland — Dozens of world leaders converged on a Swiss resort Saturday to discuss how to bring peace to war-ravaged Ukraine, though any hopes of a real breakthrough were muted by the absence of Russia. More than two years into the war, the combatants remain as far apart as they’ve ever been, with Kyiv sticking to its demands that Russia leave all Ukrainian territory it has seized and Moscow pressing on with its grinding offensive that has already taken large swaths of eastern and southern Ukraine. Despite Russia’s absence from the conference at the Bürgenstock resort overlooking Lake Lucerne, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that one measure of the event’s success was “bringing back to the world the idea that joint efforts can stop war and establish a just peace.” Attendees faced a tricky balancing act, with many chastising Russia for breaking international law while hedging their positions to leave the door open for Moscow to join future peace talks that might bring about an end to the conflict one day. “Here, there are representatives from Latin America, Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, the Pacific, North America and religious leaders,” Zelensky said. “Now, there is no Russia here. Why? Because if Russia was interested in peace, there would be no war.” “We must decide together what a just peace means for the world and how it can be achieved in a truly lasting way,” he said. “At the first peace summit, we must determine how to achieve a just peace, so that at the second, we can already settle on a real end to the war.” About half of the roughly 100 delegations were led by heads of state and government. Analysts said turnout would be a key indicator about how much pull Ukraine and its staunch Western backers have with the broader international community. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday sought to cast a shadow over the Swiss-Ukrainian initiative for the conference. Some countries such as India, Turkey and Saudi Arabia that have retained ties, at times lucrative, with Moscow – unlike Western powers that have sanctioned Russia over the war – were also on hand. Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, told the conference that credible peace talks will need Russia’s participation and require “difficult compromise.” Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, acknowledged the mistrust between Russia and Ukraine, saying “each side regards the other party’s steps (in floating proposals) as an extension of broader war effort.” “Excellencies, I must also note that this summit could have been more results-oriented if the other party to the conflict — Russia — was present in the room,” he added. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, representing the United States while President Biden attended a fundraiser in California, reiterated America’s full backing for Ukraine and announced $1.5 billion in new U.S. assistance for an array of projects such as energy infrastructure and civilian security. China, which backs Russia, joined scores of countries that sat out the event. Beijing has said any peace process would require the participation of Russia and Ukraine, and has floated its own ideas for peace. In a separate initiative last month, China and Brazil agreed to six “common understandings” toward a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, asking other countries to play a role in promoting peace talks to be held “at a proper time” with both Russia and Ukraine involved. The standoff over Ukraine is steeped in security for Europe – it is the continent’s deadliest conflict since World War II – and big-power geopolitics. U.S. intelligence officials say China has increased sales of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology to Russia that Moscow is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry to fuel its war effort. “What is clear is that China is not here, and I presume they’re not here because Putin asked them not to come and they obliged Putin,” said Biden’s top foreign policy advisor, Jake Sullivan. “And I think that says something about where China stands with respect to Russia’s war in Ukraine. I think countries should take notice of that.” Harris and Sullivan both acknowledged that not all participants were on the same page about an eventual peace settlement. Russian troops who control nearly a quarter of Ukraine have made territorial gains in recent months. When talk of the Swiss-hosted peace summit began last summer, Ukrainian forces had recently regained large tracts of territory, notably near the southern city of Kherson and the northern city of Kharkiv. The conference centers on three agenda items – seen as the least controversial bits of a 10-point peace “formula” laid out by Zelensky: Nuclear safety, including at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia power plant; possible prisoner of war exchanges; and global food security. The war has disrupted shipments of food and fertilizer through the Black Sea. Zelensky’s plan also called for the withdrawal of Russian troops from occupied Ukrainian territory, the cessation of hostilities and the restoration of Ukraine’s original borders with Russia, including Russia’s withdrawal from occupied Crimea. With Ukrainian mostly on the defensive these days, those appear to be increasingly distant hopes. Putin wants any peace deal to be built around a draft agreement negotiated in the early phases of the war that included provisions for Ukraine’s neutral status and limits on its armed forces, while delaying talks about Russian-occupied areas. Ukraine’s push to join NATO over the years has rankled Moscow. He wants Ukraine to drop its bid to join NATO and pull its forces out of regions that Russia illegally annexed in 2022. “The situation on the battlefield has changed dramatically,” said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, noting that although Russia “can’t achieve its maximalist objectives quickly through military means,” it is gaining momentum on the battlefield.

                    "text": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippines has asked a United Nations body to formally recognize the extent of its undersea continental seabed in the South China Sea, where it would have the exclusive right to exploit resources, the Department of Foreign Affairs said Saturday, in a move that rejects China’s vast territorial claims to the region. The Philippine government submitted information to the U.N. Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf on the extent of its undersea shelf in the South China Sea, off western Palawan province, after more than a decade and a half of scientific research, the department said. China did not immediately comment but it will likely contest the Philippine move. The undersea region where the Philippines seeks to formally establish its sovereign rights under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS, covers the Spratlys, a chain of islands, islets, reefs and atolls that has been fiercely contested over the years by China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. Indonesia has also confronted Chinese coast guard and fishing fleets in the gas-rich Natuna sea in the fringes of the South China Sea. “Incidents in the waters tend to overshadow the importance of what lies beneath,” Philippine Foreign Assistant Secretary Marshall Louis Alferez said. “The seabed and the subsoil extending from our archipelago up to the maximum extent allowed by UNCLOS hold significant potential resources that will benefit our nation and our people for generations to come.” “Today, we secure our future by making a manifestation of our exclusive right to explore and exploit natural resources in our extended continental shelf entitlement,” Alferez said. Under the 1982 U.N. convention, a coastal state could have exclusive rights to exploit resources in its continental shelf, a vast stretch of seabed that can extend up to 350 nautical miles (648 kilometers), including the right to authorize and regulate any kind of drilling. The Philippines’ undersea continental shelf could potentially overlap with those of other coastal states in the South China Sea, including that of Vietnam. Philippine officials expressed readiness to hold talks to resolve such issues based on UNCLOS. Philippine permanent representative to the U.N. Antonio Lagdameo said the move “can reinvigorate efforts of states to demonstrate their readiness to pursue UNCLOS processes in the determination of maritime entitlements and promote a rules-based international order.” Hostilities and tensions in the disputed waters have alarmingly escalated particularly between China and the Philippines over two disputed shoals since last year. Chinese coast guard ships and suspected militia vessels have used powerful water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers against Philippine coast guard patrol ships and navy boats that have injured Filipino navy personnel, damaged their supply boats and strained diplomatic relations between the two countries. After a tense standoff between Philippine and Chinese ships near a shoal in 2012, the Philippines brought its disputes with China the following year to international arbitration. The arbitration panel invalidated China’s claim to virtually the entire South China Sea in a 2016 ruling but Beijing refused to participate in the arbitration, rejected the decision and continues to defy it.",

                    "text": "MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines filed a claim with the U.N. on Saturday to an extended continental shelf (ECS) in the South China Sea, a waterway where it has had increasingly confrontational maritime disputes with China. \"Today we secure our future by making a manifestation of our exclusive right to explore and exploit natural resources in our ECS entitlement,\" Marshall Louis Alferez, foreign ministry assistant secretary for maritime and ocean affairs, said in a statement. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam. Portions of the strategic waterway, where $3 trillion worth of trade passes annually, are believed to be rich in oil and natural gas deposits, as well as fish stocks. The Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2016 found China's sweeping claims have no legal basis, a ruling Beijing rejects. China's embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday's U.N. filing. In its confrontations with Philippine government and fishing vessels, China's coastguard has stepped up the use of water cannon, collision and ramming tactics and, according to Manila, use of a military-grade laser. An armada of Chinese fishing boats is considered by the Philippines and its allies to be a sea militia. The Philippines sought to register its entitlement to an extended continental shelf in the West Palawan Region facing the South China Sea. The submission, cleared by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, follows a comprehensive technical and scientific study of continental shelf in the West Philippine Sea, the foreign ministry said, referring to a part of South China Sea within its 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone. The Philippines said it was using an entitlement under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea to establish the outer limits of its continental shelf, comprising the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas up to 350 nautical miles. The U.N. in 2012 confirmed Benham Rise, which is off the Philippines' east coast and not under dispute with China, as part of the Philippines' extended continental shelf.

                    "text": "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines has asked a United Nations body to formally recognize the extent of its undersea continental seabed in the South China Sea, where it would have the exclusive right to exploit resources, the Department of Foreign Affairs said Saturday, in a move that rejects China’s vast territorial claims to the region. The Philippine government submitted information to the U.N. Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf on the extent of its undersea shelf in the South China Sea, off western Palawan province, after more than a decade and a half of scientific research, the department said. China did not immediately comment but it will likely contest the Philippine move. The undersea region where the Philippines seeks to formally establish its sovereign rights under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS, covers the Spratlys, a chain of islands, islets, reefs and atolls that has been fiercely contested over the years by China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. Indonesia has also confronted Chinese coast guard and fishing fleets in the gas-rich Natuna sea in the fringes of the South China Sea. “Incidents in the waters tend to overshadow the importance of what lies beneath,” Philippine Foreign Assistant Secretary Marshall Louis Alferez said. “The seabed and the subsoil extending from our archipelago up to the maximum extent allowed by UNCLOS hold significant potential resources that will benefit our nation and our people for generations to come.” “Today, we secure our future by making a manifestation of our exclusive right to explore and exploit natural resources in our extended continental shelf entitlement,” Alferez said. Under the 1982 U.N. convention, a coastal state could have exclusive rights to exploit resources in its continental shelf, a vast stretch of seabed that can extend up to 350 nautical miles (648 kilometers), including the right to authorize and regulate any kind of drilling. The Philippines’ undersea continental shelf could potentially overlap with those of other coastal states in the South China Sea, including that of Vietnam. Philippine officials expressed readiness to hold talks to resolve such issues based on UNCLOS. Philippine permanent representative to the U.N. Antonio Lagdameo said the move “can reinvigorate efforts of states to demonstrate their readiness to pursue UNCLOS processes in the determination of maritime entitlements and promote a rules-based international order.” Hostilities and tensions in the disputed waters have alarmingly escalated particularly between China and the Philippines over two disputed shoals since last year. Chinese coast guard ships and suspected militia vessels have used powerful water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers against Philippine coast guard patrol ships and navy boats that have injured Filipino navy personnel, damaged their supply boats and strained diplomatic relations between the two countries. After a tense standoff between Philippine and Chinese ships near a shoal in 2012, the Philippines brought its disputes with China the following year to international arbitration. The arbitration panel invalidated China’s claim to virtually the entire South China Sea in a 2016 ruling but Beijing refused to participate in the arbitration, rejected the decision and continues to defy it.",

                    "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — After flying through the night across nine time zones, from southern Italy to Southern California, President Joe Biden is shifting his focus from Russia’s challenge of Western unity to raking in big money for his reelection campaign at a Hollywood fundraiser featuring George Clooney and Julia Roberts. Biden went straight from the Group of Seven summit of wealthy democracies, where Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine took center stage, to Los Angeles and the glitzy gathering unfolding Saturday night at the Peacock Theater. The journey was only broken up by a layover to refuel outside Washington. Former President Barack Obama is joining headliners Clooney and Roberts, and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel will interview all of them onstage. In a text message to donors beforehand, Roberts called it “a crucial time in the election.” Kimmel wrote in his own text that presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump “will hate this, so let’s do it.” Luminaries from the entertainment world have increasingly lined up to help Biden’s campaign, hoping to provide a fundraising jolt and to energize would-be supporters to turn out ahead of Election Day against Trump. But hobnobbing with stars this time means Biden is skipping a summit in Switzerland about ways to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. Vice President Kamala Harris is representing the United States. It’s a stark reminder that his responsibilities as president and his reelection effort can sometimes conflict. “We are going to see an unprecedented and record-setting turnout from the media and entertainment world,” Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood mogul, major Democratic donor and co-chair of Biden’s campaign, said in a statement. A Biden fundraiser in March at Radio City Music Hall in New York featured late-night host Stephen Colbert interviewing the president, Obama and former President Bill Clinton. It raised a then-record $26 million, but the California event will bring in at least $28 million, according to the Biden campaign. Still, Trump has hauled in even bigger numbers. He outpaced Biden’s New York event in April, raking in $50.5 million at a gathering of major donors at the Florida home of billionaire investor John Paulson. The former president’s campaign and the Republican National Committee announced they had raised a whopping $141 million in May, padded by tens of millions of dollars in contributions that flowed in after Trump’s guilty verdict in his criminal hush money trial. That post-conviction bump came after Trump and the Republican Party announced collecting $76 million in April, far exceeding Biden and the Democrats’ $51 million for the month and narrowing a fundraising advantage Biden built earlier in the race. With Biden absent at the gathering on Ukraine, Harris is making the trip to Switzerland and back in a little more than 24 hours. At a joint appearance with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the G7 summit, Biden said Harris would be a strong representative of his administration at the meeting. But Zelenskyy previously suggested that it was “not a strong decision” for Biden to miss the event. “I would want President Biden to be personally present,” he said late last month, predicting that Putin would “stand and applaud” Biden not coming. Putin and Russian representatives also aren’t going to the summit. Biden’s fundraiser was expected to attract protests from pro-Palestinian activists angry about his administration’s handling of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. Such demonstrations have become common wherever Biden goes in recent months, including outside his Radio City Music Hall fundraiser. —- Weissert reported from Washington.

                    "text": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has returned his Key to the City of New York at the request of New York City Mayor Eric Adams three weeks after the music mogul was seen beating his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a leaked video from 2016. On June 4, Adams sent a letter to Combs, 54, informing him that the key had been rescinded and requesting its immediate return. Copies of the letter were mailed to the rapper's company Combs Enterprises LLC's offices in New York and Los Angeles. Fabien Levy, deputy mayor for communications, confirmed to Fox News Digital on Saturday that the key had been returned to the possession of the city on June 10. \"Like many people, I was deeply disturbed by recent footage of Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs assaulting his then partner,\" Adams wrote in the letter obtained by Fox News Digital. TRY FOX NEWS' FUN NEW GAMES PAGE, WITH 6 GAMES TO CHOOSE FROM! He continued, \"I strongly condemn these actions and stand in solidarity with all survivors of domestic and gender-based violence. Our city has worked tirelessly to make sure survivors are heard and seen by our administration.\" HOWARD UNIVERSITY REVOKES DIDDY'S HONORARY DEGREE AMID LAWSUITS AND FEDERAL PROBE \"The Key to the City of New York is presented to individuals whose service to the public and the common good rises to the highest level of achievement, and who act as a model for fellow and future New Yorkers,\" Adams added. \"After internal deliberations, the Key to the City of New York committee recommended nullifying and rescinding Mr. Combs’ key.\" \"I have accepted their recommendation and am requesting that Mr. Combs immediately return his Key to the City,\" the mayor concluded. \"The city record will be updated to reflect our decision.\" Combs received the key from Adams during a ceremony in New York's Times Square on Sept. 15, 2023. Representatives for Combs did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS In the 2016 surveillance video, which was obtained exclusively by CNN and released on May 17, Combs was seen wearing just socks and a towel around his waist as he brutally beat Ventura in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel. The video corroborated part of Ventura's November lawsuit against the entertainment mogul. On Nov. 16, Ventura sued Combs in federal court, accusing him of physical and sexual abuse. However, she dropped the case after the parties reached an out-of-court settlement a day later. The key is not the only accolade that the mogul has lost since the shocking video surfaced. Last week, Howard University announced on June 7 that it had revoked the honorary degree conferred upon Combs following a unanimous vote by its Board of Trustees. \"Mr. Combs’ behavior as captured in a recently released video is so fundamentally incompatible with Howard University’s core values and beliefs that he is deemed no longer worthy to hold the institution’s highest honor,\" read a statement posted on the university's website. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER I\"The Howard University Board of Trustees voted unanimously today to accept the return by Mr. Sean Combs of the honorary degree conferred upon him in 2014,\" it continued. \"This acceptance revokes all honors and privileges associated with the degree. Accordingly, the Board has directed that his name be removed from all documents listing honorary degree recipients of Howard University.\" \"The University is unwavering in its opposition to all acts of interpersonal violence,\" the statement added. In addition, the university returned a $1 million donation from Combs, disbanded the scholarship program in his name and terminated a $1 million pledge agreement made in 2023 with the Sean Combs Foundation. Combs apologized in a May Instagram video, calling his behavior \"inexcusable.\" However, he never mentioned Ventura by name.

                    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Sean “ Diddy ” Combs has returned his key to New York City after a request from Mayor Eric Adams in response to the release of a video showing the music mogul attacking R&B singer Cassie, officials said Saturday. The mayor’s office said Combs returned the key after Adams sent letters to the embattled musician’s offices in New York and California on June 4 rescinding the key and asking for it to be sent back to City Hall. The city received the key June 10. In his letter, Adams wrote he was “deeply disturbed” by the attack, adding “I strongly condemn these actions and stand in solidarity with all survivors of domestic and gender-based violence.” Combs’ career has been derailed by numerous accusations of sexual abuse, as well as a federal criminal sex-trafficking investigation that led to raids of Combs’ mansions in Los Angeles and Miami. In May, CNN aired security video of Combs attacking Cassie in a hotel hallway in Los Angeles in 2016. Combs has said he is “truly sorry” for the attack on Cassie and called his actions “inexcusable.” Cassie, whose legal name is Cassandra Ventura, sued Combs last year, setting off a wave of increased scrutiny on Combs. That case was settled a day after it was filed. Adams awarded Combs with the key at a ceremony last year that coincided with the release of a new album. Howard University this month rescinded an honorary degree awarded to Combs and ended a scholarship program in his name following the release of the video involving Cassie. Combs, founder of Bad Boy Records, is one of the most influential hip-hop producers and executives in the last three decades, turning musical success into a business empire. An email sent to a representative listed online for Combs was not immediately returned.",
