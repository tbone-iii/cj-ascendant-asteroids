                    "text": "The Supreme Court on Friday upheld federal prohibitions on possession of firearms for individuals subjected to domestic violence restraining orders. “When an individual has been found by a court to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another, that individual may be temporarily disarmed consistent with the Second Amendment,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the 8-1 decision. The decision marks the high court’s first major Second Amendment decision since its landmark ruling in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, which held that courts must look at whether a gun law is consistent with the United States’ “history and tradition” of firearm regulation. The test became a point of contention for some lower court judges who said it was difficult to apply, in part due to an array of different interpretations of the test that have been applied since 2022. The case known as Rahimi v. U.S. involved plaintiff Zackey Rahimi, who previously pleaded guilty to possessing firearms while under a civil protective order that banned him from harassing, stalking, or threatening his ex-girlfriend and their child and also banned him from having guns. Rahimi remains in jail as he faces separate gun charges, including for his participation in a string of five different shootings between December 2020 and January 2021. Separate from his state criminal charges, a grand jury indicted Rahimi on charges of violating 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8), a federal law that prohibits a person under such an order from having a gun, an offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Mr. Rahimi argued the law violated the Second Amendment. Last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled in favor of Rahimi over his bid to challenge the federal statute surrounding gun ownership for individuals under a civil domestic violence restraining order. The 5th Circuit ultimately found the federal statute was unconstitutional under the Second Amendment and the Bruen precedent. The appeals court’s decision was met with strong opposition from the Biden administration, prompting U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to appeal to the Supreme Court. The Biden administration argued that the law is necessary to protect victims of domestic violence, citing statistics that show a significant proportion of domestic homicides involve firearms. In Bruen, the court established that firearms regulations must align with the nation’s “historical tradition.” This precedent was set when the justices, in a 6-3 decision written in 2022 by Justice Clarence Thomas, overturned New York’s handgun licensing requirements. The Rahimi case ultimately posed a significant challenge for the Supreme Court’s delicate balancing act between adhering to Second Amendment rights and upholding the rule of law. During the oral arguments, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar emphasized the risks posed by allowing individuals deemed dangerous to possess guns. She argued that people under restraining orders fall into a category of “not responsible citizens” who historically have been subject to disarmament for public safety reasons. Roberts and other justices questioned the appropriate legal test to balance the Second Amendment rights with public safety concerns. Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the court’s majority in Bruen, highlighted that the Second Amendment permits various gun regulations, including disarmament of individuals who pose a danger to society. The outcome of Rahimi will likely provide some clarity on how the historical framework established in Bruen applies to modern gun control measures, though legal experts have suggested the decision is unlikely to redesign the two-year-old Second Amendment test. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden‘s son Hunter Biden was found guilty by a jury this month for violating a subcomponent of § 922(g) which prohibits people who are under the influence of illicit drugs or have been addicted to such substances from owning a firearm. The jury convicted the younger Biden on Tuesday of lying on a federal form to purchase a gun by asserting he was not a drug user, lying to a federally licensed firearm dealer, and illegally owning the gun for 11 days. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER As Hunter Biden’s attorneys have vowed to appeal the conviction, the 5th Circuit recently found that Section 922(g)(3), which punishes anyone who is an “unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance,” is unconstitutional under the Bruen framework. The younger Biden’s case could take longer to reach the high court as his appeals process has yet to begin, but the similarities behind another, similar case that is further along in the process could serve as a vehicle for his bid to challenge the law under which he was convicted.",

Activists rally outside the U.S. Supreme Court before the start of oral arguments in United States ... [+] v. Rahimi in Washington on Tuesday, November 7, 2023. CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images Key Facts The court ruled 8-1 in U.S. v. Rahimi, a case challenging whether the federal statute that bars people with domestic violence restraining orders from possessing firearms violates the Second Amendment. The challenge was brought based on the Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling in New York State & Pistol Association v. Bruen, which struck down New York’s concealed carry law and made it harder to enact gun restrictions, ruling that any restrictions must be “consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation” and reflect historical laws governing guns. Americans can be “temporarily disarmed” under the Second Amendment if they’ve “been found by a court to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another,” Chief Justice John Roberts ruled, writing for the court’s majority. Tangent U.S. v. Rahimi is one of several gun-related cases the court considered this term. Justices also weighed in on the legality of bump stocks, which are used to convert firearms into automatic weapons, in the case Garland v. Cargill, striking down a federal ban on the devices. The court also heard a case brought by the National Rifle Association (NRA), which questioned whether New York’s Department of Financial Services acted unlawfully by urging companies to cut ties with the NRA, warning of the “reputational risks” that could come from associating with the group after the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida. Justices ruled in the NRA’s favor. Key Background U.S. v. Rahimi was brought by Zackey Rahimi, who was indicted for carrying out five shootings between December 2020 and January 2021. Rahimi was charged under the statute banning firearm possession by a domestic abuser, as he had such a restraining order against him. The defendant challenged his charges in court, arguing the statute was unconstitutional, and while the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals initially ruled against him, it then reversed course and ruled in his favor based on the Supreme Court’s ruling in the Bruen case. The Bruen ruling has impacted a slew of rulings and gun regulations in the two years since the opinion came out, with U.S. v. Rahimi marking the first case in which justices have had to contend with the impact of their decisions. More than a dozen state and federal laws have been wholly or partially invalidated in court so far as a result of the court’s ruling, according to a 2023 study published in the Duke Law Journal, with 31 court rulings through Feb. 2023, primarily by Republican-appointed judges, finding gun laws have violated the Second Amendment. Surprising Fact There’s a correlation between mass shootings and domestic violence, as a 2021 study published in the journal Injury Epidemiology found shooters in 68.2% of mass shootings between 2014 and 2019 either killed a partner or family member or had a history of domestic violence. Firearm use is also common in deadly domestic violence situations, with a 2020 study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law finding 54.1% of domestic homicides—defined as being committed by family members or romantic partners—involve a firearm. The study found firearm use was associated with a 70.9% increase in there being additional victims in domestic homicides. This story is breaking and will be updated.

In an 8-1 opinion authored by Chief Justice Roberts, the court's majority said, \"[W]e conclude only this: An individual found by a court to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another may be temporarily disarmed consistent with the Second Amendment.\" In oral arguments in November, justices on both sides of the ideological spectrum seemed to agree with the Biden administration that there was a history and tradition of keeping firearms from dangerous people despite the lack of any specific ban that may have been in place when the Constitution was enacted. Friday's ruling in the case, U.S. v. Rahimi, could have major implications for several gun-rights measures working their way through the legal system and in state legislatures. SUPREME COURT APPEARS LIKELY TO HAND BIDEN DOJ A WIN ON CHALLENGE TO GUN LAW It could also affect current cases that deal with whether current and former drug users can similarly be denied gun ownership – like that of Hunter Biden. The president's son was convicted on criminal charges for allegedly lying on a federal registration form in 2018 about his drug addiction when buying a firearm. He is likely to appeal that conviction. The case before the court stemmed from a lawsuit that involves a Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, who – under a DVRO – argued he still had a right to keep a gun for self-protection. Rahimi was charged with separate state offenses that began with the 2019 physical assault of his ex-girlfriend and later another woman by use of firearms.

                    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a federal gun control law that is intended to protect victims of domestic violence. In their first Second Amendment case since they expanded gun rights in 2022, the justices ruled 8-1 in favor of a 1994 ban on firearms for people under restraining orders to stay away from their spouses or partners. The justices reversed a ruling from the federal appeals court in New Orleans that had struck down the law. Justice Clarence Thomas, the author of the 2022 ruling, dissented. Last week, the court overturned a Trump-era ban on bump stocks, the rapid-fire gun accessories used in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The court ruled that the Justice Department exceeded its authority in imposing that ban. Friday’s case stemmed directly from the Supreme Court’s Bruen decision in June 2022. A Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, was accused of hitting his girlfriend during an argument in a parking lot and later threatening to shoot her. At arguments in November, some justices voiced concern that a ruling for Rahimi could also jeopardize the background check system that the Biden administration said has stopped more than 75,000 gun sales in the past 25 years based on domestic violence protective orders. The case also had been closely watched for its potential to affect cases in which other gun ownership laws have been called into question, including in the high-profile prosecution of Hunter Biden. President Joe Biden’s son was convicted of lying on a form to buy a firearm while he was addicted to drugs. His lawyers have signaled they will appeal. A decision to strike down the domestic violence gun law might have signaled the court’s skepticism of the other laws as well. The justices could weigh in soon in one or more of those other cases. Many of the gun law cases grow out of the Bruen decision. That high court ruling not only expanded Americans’ gun rights under the Constitution but also changed the way courts are supposed to evaluate restrictions on firearms. Rahimi’s case reached the Supreme Court after prosecutors appealed a ruling that threw out his conviction for possessing guns while subject to a restraining order. Rahimi was involved in five shootings over two months in and around Arlington, Texas, U.S. Circuit Judge Cory Wilson noted. When police identified Rahimi as a suspect in the shootings and showed up at his home with a search warrant, he admitted having guns in the house and being subject to a domestic violence restraining order that prohibited gun possession, Wilson wrote. But even though Rahimi was hardly “a model citizen,” Wilson wrote, the law at issue could not be justified by looking to history. That’s the test Justice Clarence Thomas laid out in his opinion for the court in Bruen. The appeals court initially upheld the conviction under a balancing test that included whether the restriction enhances public safety. But the panel reversed course after Bruen. At least one district court has upheld the law since the Bruen decision. Advocates for domestic violence victims and gun control groups had called on the court to uphold the law. Firearms are the most common weapon used in homicides of spouses, intimate partners, children or relatives in recent years, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Guns were used in more than half, 57%, of those killings in 2020, a year that saw an overall increase in domestic violence during the coronavirus pandemic. Seventy women a month, on average, are shot and killed by intimate partners, according to the gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety. Gun rights groups backed Rahimi, arguing that the appeals court got it right when it looked at American history and found no restriction close enough to justify the gun ban.

                    "text": "Washington — The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a federal law that prohibits people who are subject to domestic-violence restraining orders from having firearms, ruling that the measure does not violate the Second Amendment.The court ruled 8-1 that a person who has been found by a court to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another may be temporarily disarmed consistent with the Second Amendment. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas was the lone dissenter.\"When a restraining order contains a finding that an individual poses a credible threat to the physical safety of an intimate partner, that individual may — consistent with the Second Amendment — be banned from possessing firearms while the order is in effect. Since the founding, our Nation's firearm laws have included provisions preventing individuals who threaten physical harm to others from misusing firearms,\" Roberts wrote. \"As applied to the facts of this case, [the law] fits comfortably within this tradition.\"U.S. v. RahimiThe case, known as U.S. v. Rahimi, was the first involving the Second Amendment heard by the court following its landmark June 2022 ruling that expanded gun rights and set out a new legal framework for determining when firearms restrictions are constitutional. The test requires the government to show that a challenged gun law fits with the nation's history and tradition of firearms regulation. It can satisfy that standard by putting forth laws that are analogous to the modern-day measure under scrutiny.In the wake of that ruling nearly two years ago, a number of long-standing gun laws have been challenged in federal courts and, in some instances, invalidated. But confusion and division among lower courts over how to apply the Supreme Court's so-called history-and-tradition test led to calls for the justices to clarify it.The legal battle involving the protections for victims of domestic violence presented the high court with the first opportunity to address that fallout.The case involves a law enacted by Congress 30 years ago, which prohibits people under domestic-violence restraining orders from having guns. A Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, was subject to such an order granted to a former girlfriend when he threatened another woman with a firearm and fired guns in public on five different occasions in December 2020 and January 2021.After those incidents, police executing a search warrant found two guns at Rahimi's residence. He was indicted under the 1994 law and pleaded guilty, but challenged the constitutionality of the firearms prohibition as outside constitutional bounds.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit tossed out Rahimi's conviction and invalidated the gun law after applying the Supreme Court's history-and-tradition test. The appeals court said the historical analogues put forth by prosecutors \"fall short,\" and the prohibition for people under domestic-violence restraining orders \"falls outside the class of firearm regulations countenanced by the Second Amendment.\"The justices heard arguments in the case in November. Conservative members of the court suggested that people found to be a danger to society could be disarmed and largely agreed that Rahimi, in particular, should not have access to weapons.The impacts of the decision won't be felt immediately, but could factor into challenges involving other gun laws that are moving through the lower courts or awaiting action from the justices. One of those cases involves the constitutionality of a law disarming people convicted of nonviolent felonies, and a second concerns a law prohibiting a person who is an unlawful drug user from having guns. Hunter Biden, President Biden's son, was found guilty by a Delaware jury of violating that law and two others related to his purchase and possession of a revolver in October 2018, while he was addicted to crack cocaine. The president's son can pursue an appeal of his conviction that challenges the constitutionality of the federal prohibition on drug users.",

                    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a federal gun control law that is intended to protect victims of domestic violence. In their first Second Amendment case since they expanded gun rights in 2022, the justices ruled 8-1 in favor of a 1994 ban on firearms for people under restraining orders to stay away from their spouses or partners. The justices reversed a ruling from the federal appeals court in New Orleans that had struck down the law. Justice Clarence Thomas, the author of the 2022 ruling, dissented. Last week, the court overturned a Trump-era ban on bump stocks, the rapid-fire gun accessories used in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The court ruled that the Justice Department exceeded its authority in imposing that ban. Friday’s case stemmed directly from the Supreme Court’s Bruen decision in June 2022. A Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, was accused of hitting his girlfriend during an argument in a parking lot and later threatening to shoot her. At arguments in November, some justices voiced concern that a ruling for Rahimi could also jeopardize the background check system that the Biden administration said has stopped more than 75,000 gun sales in the past 25 years based on domestic violence protective orders. The case also had been closely watched for its potential to affect cases in which other gun ownership laws have been called into question, including in the high-profile prosecution of Hunter Biden. President Joe Biden’s son was convicted of lying on a form to buy a firearm while he was addicted to drugs. His lawyers have signaled they will appeal.

                    "text": "The Supreme Court this morning upheld by 8–1 a federal law that bars people under domestic violence-related restraining orders from possessing firearms. The justices found that the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is not violated when an individual is disarmed after a court has found him to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another. The ruling overturned a lower court decision that overturned a federal law. The new decision comes in the wake of the Supreme Court’s landmark 2022 ruling in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen. That decision recognized a constitutional right to bear arms in public for self-defense and held that restrictions on guns must be deeply rooted in American history if they are to survive constitutional scrutiny. The case of United States v. Rahimi concerns a February 2023 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit that struck down Section 922(g)(8) of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, a 1994 law that prohibits a person who is subject to a domestic restraining order from having a gun. The 5th Circuit held the statute had ceased to be constitutional in light of the Bruen precedent. The ban on the possession of firearms by someone under a domestic restraining order “is an outlier that our ancestors would never have accepted,” the circuit court said at the time. The case involves Zackey Rahimi of Texas, who previously entered a guilty plea to violating the federal statute. Mr. Rahimi was involved in five shooting incidents after a restraining order was entered against him in February 2020. After the Bruen decision was handed down, he asked the courts to review his conviction, given the change in Second Amendment jurisprudence. Second Amendment advocates said Mr. Rahimi, whose family emigrated from Afghanistan, was not an ideal spokesman for their cause given his history of violence, but they stood by their argument that the 5th Circuit ruled correctly. In a brief, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said the 5th Circuit ruling has had “significant disruptive consequences.” That court “overlooked the strong historical evidence supporting the general principle that the government may disarm dangerous individuals,” she wrote. At the oral argument on Nov. 7, 2023, Ms. Prelogar told the justices that “guns and domestic abuse are a deadly combination.” Also at the hearing, Mr. Rahimi’s attorney, assistant federal public defender Matthew Wright, said that when Congress enacted the law in 1994, it acted without the benefit of recent Supreme Court rulings that bolstered the Second Amendment. “So we shouldn’t be surprised that they missed the mark. They made a one-sided proceeding that is short a complete proxy for a total denial of a fundamental and individual constitutional right,” the lawyer said at the time.",

                    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a federal gun control law that is intended to protect victims of domestic violence. In their first Second Amendment case since they expanded gun rights in 2022, the justices ruled 8-1 in favor of a 1994 ban on firearms for people under restraining orders to stay away from their spouses or partners. The justices reversed a ruling from the federal appeals court in New Orleans that had struck down the law. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the court, said the law uses “common sense” and applies only \"after a judge determines that an individual poses a credible threat” of physical violence. Justice Clarence Thomas, the author of the 2022 Bruen ruling in a New York case, dissented. Last week, the court overturned a Trump-era ban on bump stocks, the rapid-fire gun accessories used in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The court ruled that the Justice Department exceeded its authority in imposing that ban. Friday's case stemmed directly from the Supreme Court’s Bruen decision in June 2022. A Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, was accused of hitting his girlfriend during an argument in a parking lot and later threatening to shoot her. At arguments in November, some justices voiced concern that a ruling for Rahimi could also jeopardize the background check system that the Biden administration said has stopped more than 75,000 gun sales in the past 25 years based on domestic violence protective orders. The case also had been closely watched for its potential to affect cases in which other gun ownership laws have been called into question, including in the high-profile prosecution of Hunter Biden. President Joe Biden’s son was convicted of lying on a form to buy a firearm while he was addicted to drugs. His lawyers have signaled they will appeal. A decision to strike down the domestic violence gun law might have signaled the court's skepticism of the other laws as well. But Friday's decision did not suggest that the court would necessarily uphold those law either. The justices could weigh in soon in one or more of those other cases. Many of the gun law cases grow out of the Bruen decision. That high court ruling not only expanded Americans’ gun rights under the Constitution but also changed the way courts are supposed to evaluate restrictions on firearms. Roberts turned to history in his opinion. \"Since the founding, our nation’s firearm laws have included provisions preventing individuals who threaten physical harm to others from misusing firearms,” he wrote. Rahimi’s case reached the Supreme Court after prosecutors appealed a ruling that threw out his conviction for possessing guns while subject to a restraining order. Rahimi was involved in five shootings over two months in and around Arlington, Texas, U.S. Circuit Judge Cory Wilson noted. When police identified Rahimi as a suspect in the shootings and showed up at his home with a search warrant, he admitted having guns in the house and being subject to a domestic violence restraining order that prohibited gun possession, Wilson wrote. But even though Rahimi was hardly “a model citizen,” Wilson wrote, the law at issue could not be justified by looking to history. That’s the test Justice Thomas laid out in his opinion for the court in Bruen. The appeals court initially upheld the conviction under a balancing test that included whether the restriction enhances public safety. But the panel reversed course after Bruen. At least one district court has upheld the law since the Bruen decision. Advocates for domestic violence victims and gun control groups had called on the court to uphold the law. Firearms are the most common weapon used in homicides of spouses, intimate partners, children or relatives in recent years, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Guns were used in more than half, 57%, of those killings in 2020, a year that saw an overall increase in domestic violence during the coronavirus pandemic. Seventy women a month, on average, are shot and killed by intimate partners, according to the gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety. Gun rights groups backed Rahimi, arguing that the appeals court got it right when it looked at American history and found no restriction close enough to justify the gun ban. ___ Follow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",

The 8-1 opinion was authored by Chief Justice John Roberts. Justice Clarence Thomas dissented. \"When a restraining order contains a finding that an individual poses a credible threat to the physical safety of an intimate partner, that individual may-consistent with the Second Amendment-be banned from possessing firearms while the order is in effect,\" Roberts wrote. \"Since the founding, our Nation's firearm laws have included provisions preventing individuals who threaten physical harm to others from misusing firearms.\" In other words, the court held someone in those circumstances could be temporarily disarmed. The case, U.S. v. Rahimi, marked a major test for the court since its decision in 2022 that expanded gun rights and created a new framework for evaluating Second Amendment cases. The 1994 federal statute at the center of the case requires thousands of domestic violence restraining orders issued each year by federal and state judges to be reported to the national background check system, which would serve as a basis to deny a firearm sale. \"Taken together, the surety and going armed laws confirm what common sense suggests: When an individual poses a clear threat of physical violence to another, the threatening individual may be disarmed,\" Roberts wrote.

In their first Second Amendment case since they expanded gun rights in 2022, the justices ruled 8-1 in favor of a 1994 ban on firearms for people under restraining orders to stay away from their spouses or partners. The justices reversed a ruling from the federal appeals court in New Orleans that had struck down the law. Justice Clarence Thomas, the author of the 2022 ruling, dissented. Last week, the court overturned a Trump-era ban on bump stocks, the rapid-fire gun accessories used in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. The court ruled that the Justice Department exceeded its authority in imposing that ban. Friday’s case stemmed directly from the Supreme Court’s Bruen decision in June 2022. A Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, was accused of hitting his girlfriend during an argument in a parking lot and later threatening to shoot her. At arguments in November, some justices voiced concern that a ruling for Rahimi could also jeopardize the background check system that the Biden administration said has stopped more than 75,000 gun sales in the past 25 years based on domestic violence protective orders. The case also had been closely watched for its potential to affect cases in which other gun ownership laws have been called into question, including in the high-profile prosecution of Hunter Biden. President Joe Biden’s son was convicted of lying on a form to buy a firearm while he was addicted to drugs. His lawyers have signaled they will appeal. A decision to strike down the domestic violence gun law might have signaled the court’s skepticism of the other laws as well. The justices could weigh in soon in one or more of those other cases. Many of the gun law cases grow out of the Bruen decision. That high court ruling not only expanded Americans’ gun rights under the Constitution but also changed the way courts are supposed to evaluate restrictions on firearms. Rahimi’s case reached the Supreme Court after prosecutors appealed a ruling that threw out his conviction for possessing guns while subject to a restraining order. Rahimi was involved in five shootings over two months in and around Arlington, Texas, U.S. Circuit Judge Cory Wilson noted. When police identified Rahimi as a suspect in the shootings and showed up at his home with a search warrant, he admitted having guns in the house and being subject to a domestic violence restraining order that prohibited gun possession, Wilson wrote. But even though Rahimi was hardly “a model citizen,” Wilson wrote, the law at issue could not be justified by looking to history. That’s the test Justice Clarence Thomas laid out in his opinion for the court in Bruen. The appeals court initially upheld the conviction under a balancing test that included whether the restriction enhances public safety. But the panel reversed course after Bruen. At least one district court has upheld the law since the Bruen decision. Advocates for domestic violence victims and gun control groups had called on the court to uphold the law. Firearms are the most common weapon used in homicides of spouses, intimate partners, children or relatives in recent years, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Guns were used in more than half, 57%, of those killings in 2020, a year that saw an overall increase in domestic violence during the coronavirus pandemic. Seventy women a month, on average, are shot and killed by intimate partners, according to the gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety. Gun rights groups backed Rahimi, arguing that the appeals court got it right when it looked at American history and found no restriction close enough to justify the gun ban.",

                    "text": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a federal gun control law that is intended to protect victims of domestic violence. In their first Second Amendment case since they expanded gun rights in 2022, the justices ruled 8-1 in favor of a 1994 ban on firearms for people under restraining orders to stay away from their spouses or partners. The justices reversed a ruling from the federal appeals court in New Orleans that had struck down the law. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the court, said the law uses ''common sense'' and applies only \"after a judge determines that an individual poses a credible threat'' of physical violence. Justice Clarence Thomas, the author of the major 2022 Bruen ruling in a New York case, dissented. President Joe Biden, who has been critical of previous high-court rulings on guns, abortion and other hot-button issues, praised the outcome. ''No one who has been abused should have to worry about their abuser getting a gun,'' Biden said in a statement. ''As a result of today's ruling, survivors of domestic violence and their families will still be able to count on critical protections, just as they have for the past three decades.'' Last week, the court overturned a Trump-era ban on bump stocks, the rapid-fire gun accessories used in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The court ruled that the Justice Department exceeded its authority in imposing that ban. Friday's case stemmed directly from the Supreme Court's Bruen decision in June 2022. A Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, was accused of hitting his girlfriend during an argument in a parking lot and later threatening to shoot her. At arguments in November, some justices voiced concern that a ruling for Rahimi could also jeopardize the background check system that the Biden administration said has stopped more than 75,000 gun sales in the past 25 years based on domestic violence protective orders. The case also had been closely watched for its potential to affect cases in which other gun ownership laws have been called into question, including in the high-profile prosecution of Hunter Biden. Biden's son was convicted of lying on a form to buy a firearm while he was addicted to drugs. His lawyers have signaled they will appeal. A decision to strike down the domestic violence gun law might have signaled the court's skepticism of the other laws as well. But Friday's decision did not suggest that the court would necessarily uphold those law either. The justices could weigh in soon in one or more of those other cases. Many of the gun law cases grow out of the Bruen decision. That high court ruling not only expanded Americans' gun rights under the Constitution but also changed the way courts are supposed to evaluate restrictions on firearms. Roberts turned to history in his opinion. \"Since the founding, our nation's firearm laws have included provisions preventing individuals who threaten physical harm to others from misusing firearms,'' he wrote. Some courts have gone too far, Roberts wrote, in applying Bruen and other gun rights cases. \"These precedents were not meant to suggest a law trapped in amber,'' he wrote. In dissent, Thomas wrote, the law ''strips an individual of his ability to possess firearms and ammunition without any due process.'' The government ''failed to produce any evidence'' that the law is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation, he wrote. ''Not a single historical regulation justifies the statute at issue,'' Thomas wrote. Seven of the nine justices wrote opinions in the guns case spanning 94 pages, mainly focused on the proper use of history in evaluating gun restrictions and other limitations on constitutional rights. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that Roberts' opinion ''permits a historical inquiry calibrated to reveal something useful and transferable to the present day, while the dissent would make the historical inquiry so exacting as to be useless.'' She was among the three liberal justices who dissented in the Bruen case. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was part of the Bruen majority, noted that the court probably will have many more cases about the reach of gun rights because ''Second Amendment jurisprudence is in its early innings.'' It was only in 2008 that the court declared for the first time that the Constitution protects an individual's right to keep and bear arms. Rahimi's case reached the Supreme Court after prosecutors appealed a ruling that threw out his conviction for possessing guns while subject to a restraining order. Rahimi was involved in five shootings over two months in and around Arlington, Texas, U.S. Circuit Judge Cory Wilson noted. When police identified Rahimi as a suspect in the shootings and showed up at his home with a search warrant, he admitted having guns in the house and being subject to a domestic violence restraining order that prohibited gun possession, Wilson wrote. But even though Rahimi was hardly ''a model citizen,'' Wilson wrote, the law at issue could not be justified by looking to history. That's the test Justice Thomas laid out in his opinion for the court in Bruen. The appeals court initially upheld the conviction under a balancing test that included whether the restriction enhances public safety. But the panel reversed course after Bruen. At least one district court has upheld the law since the Bruen decision. After the ruling, Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department ''will continue to enforce this important statute, which for nearly 30 years has helped to protect victims and survivors of domestic violence from their abusers.'' ''As the Justice Department argued, and as the Court reaffirmed today, that commonsense prohibition is entirely consistent with the Court's precedent and the text and history of the Second Amendment,'' Garland said in a statement. Advocates for domestic violence victims and gun control groups had called on the court to uphold the law.

                    "text": "WASHINGTON >> The U.S. Supreme Court today upheld a federal law that makes it a crime for people under domestic violence restraining orders to have guns, handing a victory to President Joe Biden’s administration as the justices opted not to further widen firearms rights after a major expansion in 2022. The 8-1 ruling, authored by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, overturned a lower court’s decision striking down the 1994 law as a violation of the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment right to “keep and bear arms.” The law was challenged by a Texas man who was subject to a restraining order for assaulting his girlfriend in a parking lot and later threatening to shoot her. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had concluded that the measure failed the Supreme Court’s stringent test set in 2022 that required gun laws to be “consistent with the nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation” to comply with the Second Amendment. Roberts wrote in the ruling that since the nation’s founding, firearm laws have targeted people who threaten physical harm to others. “When a restraining order contains a finding that an individual poses a credible threat to the physical safety of an intimate partner, that individual may – consistent with the Second Amendment – be banned from possessing firearms while the order is in effect,” Roberts wrote. Biden’s administration defended the law as critical to protect public safety and abuse victims, who often are women. It emphasized that guns pose a particularly serious threat in domestic violence situations and also are extremely dangerous to police officers called to respond. “No one who has been abused should have to worry about their abuser getting a gun,” Biden said, touting his record on gun control. “As a result of (today’s) ruling, survivors of domestic violence and their families will still be able to count on critical protections, just as they have for the past three decades.” Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, who authored the 2022 ruling in a case called New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, was the lone dissenter. “Not a single historical regulation justifies the statute at issue,” Thomas wrote, adding that “in the interest of ensuring the government can regulate one subset of society, (today’s) decision puts at risk the Second Amendment rights of many more.” The case involved Zackey Rahimi, who pleaded guilty in 2021 to illegally possessing guns in violation of this law while subject to a restraining order. Police found a pistol and rifle while searching Rahimi’s residence in connection with at least five shootings, including using an assault-type rifle to fire at the home of a man to whom he had sold drugs. A federal judge had rejected Rahimi’s Second Amendment challenge and sentenced him to more than six years in prison. Violating the domestic violence gun law initially was punishable by up to 10 years in prison but has since been raised to 15 years. ‘A SIGH OF RELIEF’ Gun safety groups called today’s ruling a legal victory that will help counter firearms violence. But they condemned actions by the 5th Circuit, perhaps the most conservative federal appeals court, that let the case get this far. “As millions of domestic violence victims breathe a sigh of relief, it’s worth remembering who put them in jeopardy: extreme Trump-appointed judges on the 5th Circuit who sided with an abuser who wanted to keep his guns,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, referring to Republican former President Donald Trump. Rahimi’s lawyer declined to comment on the ruling. In a May Reuters/Ipsos poll, 75% of registered voters, including 84% of Democrats and 70% of Republicans, said that a person subject to a domestic violence restraining order should not be allowed to possess firearms. In a nation bitterly divided over how to address firearms violence including frequent mass shootings, the Supreme Court often has taken an expansive view of the Second Amendment, broadening gun rights in landmark rulings in 2008, 2010 and 2022. The 2022 Bruen ruling recognized a constitutional right to carry a handgun in public for self defense, striking down a New York state’s limits on carrying concealed handguns outside the home. In another case, the Supreme Court in a 6-3 ruling on June 14 declared unlawful a federal ban on “bump stock” devices that enable semiautomatic weapons to fire rapidly like machine guns. The 5th Circuit last year set aside Rahimi’s conviction, concluding that although he was “hardly a model citizen,” the 1994 law was an “outlier” that could not stand under the “historical tradition” standard the justices announced in Bruen. Supporters of Rahimi have argued that judges too easily issue restraining orders in an unfair process that results in the deprivation of the constitutional gun rights of accused abusers.",

The decision in favor of a 1994 law reversed a ruling from the federal appeals court in New Orleans that had struck it down. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts explains: \"Since the founding, our nation's firearm laws have included provisions preventing individuals who threaten physical harm to others from misusing firearms. As applied to the facts of this case, Section 922(g)(8) fits comfortably within this tradition.\" Justice Clarence Thomas was the sole dissent. The case involves a Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, who was accused of hitting his girlfriend during an argument in a parking lot and later threatening to shoot her if she told anyone about the assault. The girlfriend obtained a protective order against him in Tarrant County in February 2020. Eleven months later, Rahimi was a suspect in shootings when police searched his apartment and found guns. He eventually pleaded guilty to violating federal law. The federal appeals court in New Orleans overturned that conviction when it struck down the law following the Supreme Court’s Bruen decision in June 2022. That high court ruling not only expanded Americans’ gun rights under the Constitution but also changed the way courts are supposed to evaluate restrictions on firearms. The Biden Administration appealed. During oral arguments earlier this year, Justice Elena Kagan noted that “there seems to be a fair bit of division and a fair bit of confusion about what Bruen means and what Bruen requires in the lower courts.” That's because Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the majority opinion, tossed out the balancing test judges had long used to decide whether gun laws were constitutional. Rather than consider whether a law enhances public safety, judges should only weigh whether it fits into the nation’s history of gun regulation, Thomas wrote for the six conservative justices on the nine-member court. The Bruen decision has resulted in lower court rulings striking down more than a dozen laws. Those include age restrictions; bans on homemade ghost guns, which don’t have serial numbers; and prohibitions on gun ownership for people convicted of nonviolent felonies or using illegal drugs. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, defending the domestic violence law, argued that the prohibition fits within a long tradition of disarming people who are considered dangers to society and urged the justices to use this case to correct lower courts’ “profound misreading” of the decision. Justice Brett Kavanaugh voiced concern that a ruling for Rahimi could also jeopardize the background check system that the Democratic administration said has stopped more than 75,000 gun sales in the past 25 years based on domestic violence protective orders. Rahimi remains jailed in Texas, where he faces other criminal charges. In a letter he wrote from jail last summer, after the Supreme Court agreed to hear his case, Rahimi said he would “stay away from all firearms and weapons” once he’s released. The New York Times first reported the existence of the letter. Guns were used in 57% of killings of spouses, intimate partners, children or relatives in 2020, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Seventy women a month, on average, are shot and killed by intimate partners, according to the gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety.",

                    "text": "This post was originally published by the 19th. The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a federal law that prevents someone under a domestic violence restraining order from possessing firearms in the case of United States v. Rahimi. The decision was 8-1, with Justice Clarence Thomas casting the dissenting vote. In 2019, Zackey Rahimi physically assaulted his girlfriend in a parking lot in Texas and then told her that if she talked to the police about it, he would shoot her. Later, a state court granted her a domestic violence restraining order. Rahimi then threatened a different woman with a gun and was charged with assault with a deadly weapon. He shot guns in public on five more occasions, firing an AR-15 assault rifle into the home of someone who had once bought drugs from him and shooting into the air at a fast food restaurant when a friend’s credit card was declined. When police conducted a legal search of Rahimi’s home, they found multiple firearms and rounds of ammunition. Under a 1994 federal law, anyone with an active domestic violence restraining order against them is barred from possessing or purchasing firearms. Rahimi was charged with violating that law. In June 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen that any restriction on firearms must be “consistent with the Nation’s historical tradition” — meaning that it must have a point of reference rooted in the time of the Constitution’s signing. At the time of America’s founding, domestic violence restraining orders did not exist — nor were women, who are disproportionately impacted by domestic violence, considered full citizens. Thomas wrote that this precedent superseded the long-standing practice of allowing the government to weigh its interest in public safety against the possibility of imposing a limitation on Second Amendment rights. As a result of this ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit reversed its original conviction of Rahimi, saying a domestic violence restraining order could not be used to justify restricting Rahimi’s right to bear arms. “Our country has stood at a tipping point, with the safety of survivors of domestic violence on the line. But today, we took a step toward protecting millions from their abusers,” said Janet Carter, senior director of issues and appeals at Everytown Law, in a statement after the decision. “This is a major victory for gun safety in the courts, but make no mistake — we should not have been here in the first place. Lower court judges should never have been allowed to put their interpretation of early American history ahead of the lives of countless women and families across the country.” A domestic violence restraining order is a protective measure issued by a civil court. While the specifications of what these orders do can vary by state, they generally require a person accused of abuse to stop harming or threatening a victim; stay physically away from a victim’s home, workplace and school; and cease all communication with a victim. To receive such an order, an accuser must petition a civil judge and provide evidence. Civil courts’ evidentiary standard is a “preponderance of evidence,” a burden of proof below what is required for a conviction in criminal courts. If a judge finds that a preponderance of evidence shows proof of abuse, stalking, harassment or any other form of domestic or intimate partner violence, they will grant the accuser a domestic violence restraining order. Women, LGBTQ+ people and those from marginalized backgrounds are disproportionately impacted by domestic violence. Women in the United States are 11 times more likely to be killed with a firearm than women in other high-income countries, female intimate partners are more likely to be killed with a gun than all other means combined, and the presence of a gun increases the risk of homicide for women in domestic violence situations by 500 percent. One in 4 women in the United States has been the victim of severe domestic violence injury in her lifetime, and 1 in 3 women in the United States has experienced rape, stalking or domestic violence. “Today’s decision from the Supreme Court is a powerful reminder that the gun lobby cannot — and will not — be the arbiter of the lives of women and families across the country,” said Angela Ferrell-Zabala, executive director of Moms Demand Action, in a statement released after the decision. “Our movement has been fighting against the gun lobby’s extreme agenda for over a decade, and made it known that this decision would have had deadly consequences.”",

                    "text": "The US Supreme Court on Friday upheld a federal law prohibiting domestic abusers from possessing a firearm, the latest legal ruling in the country's fierce battle over gun rights.It was the first gun case to come before the court -- where conservatives hold a 6-3 majority -- since a major decision issued in 2022 loosening gun restrictions.\"When an individual has been found by a court to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another, that individual may be temporarily disarmed consistent with the second amendment,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the 8-1 opinion.\"Since the founding, the nation's firearm laws have included regulations to stop individuals who threaten physical harm to others from misusing firearms. As applied to the facts of this case, (the law) fits comfortably within this tradition.\"In the 2022 decision, the nation's highest court said it would authorize only \"reasonable\" exceptions to the second amendment right to bear arms and would rely on historical precedents when it comes to regulating firearms. That ruling left lower courts struggling to determine whether gun restrictions before them are consistent with \"the history and traditions\" of firearms regulation in the United States in the late 18th to the 19th century.An ultraconservative appeals court ruled in March that a federal law banning gun ownership by people with domestic violence restraining orders was unconstitutional, for lack of historical precedent.\"A woman who lives in a house with a domestic abuser is five times more likely to be murdered if he has access to a gun,\" Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said in November last year as she made the case for upholding the federal law for the Biden administration.\"Congress may disarm those who are not law-abiding, responsible citizens,\" she added.\"Throughout our nation's history, legislatures have disarmed those who have committed serious criminal conduct or whose access to guns poses a danger.\"She cited minors, individuals with mental illness, felons and drug addicts as among those prohibited from possessing firearms.Indicating his agreement with the government's position, Roberts -- one of the bench's conservatives -- wrote that \"some courts have misunderstood the methodology of our recent second amendment cases. These precedents were not meant to suggest a law trapped in amber.\"In the case before the court, police recovered a handgun and a rifle during a search of the Texas home of Zackey Rahimi, who had been implicated in five shootings in two months and was subject to a protective order on behalf of a former girlfriend which prohibited him from owning weapons.Rahimi's attorney Matthew Wright argued that there was no historical precedent for depriving his client of firearms without there being an actual conviction for a crime.Dissenting from the court's opinion, conservative justice Clarence Thomas said states already have criminal prosecution as a tool for disarming anyone who uses a firearm to threaten physical violence.\"Most states, including Texas, classify aggravated assault as a felony, punishable by up to 20 years' imprisonment... Thus, the question before us is not whether Rahimi and others like him can be disarmed consistent with the second amendment,\" Thomas wrote. \"Instead, the question is whether the government can strip the second amendment right of anyone subject to a protective order -- even if he has never been accused or convicted of a crime. It cannot.\"Some 100 gun control activists, including the actress Julianne Moore, carrying signs reading \"Disarm Domestic Abusers\" staged a demonstration outside the Supreme Court as the justices heard about 90 minutes of oral arguments last year.Senator Amy Klobuchar, who filed a brief urging the court to uphold the ban, said in a statement the justices had protected a \"common sense law that has been in place for 30 years.\"\"Even with today's outcome, we know there is more work to be done,\" she added.",

                    "text": "The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a federal law that prohibits people under domestic violence restraining orders from owning firearms. In an 8-1decision, the justices ruled that when an individual has been found by a court to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another, that individual may be temporarily disarmed consistent with the Second Amendment. The decision in favor of a 1994 law reversed a ruling from the federal appeals court in New Orleans that had struck it down. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts explains: \"Since the founding, our nation's firearm laws have included provisions preventing individuals who threaten physical harm to others from misusing firearms. As applied to the facts of this case, Section 922(g)(8) fits comfortably within this tradition.\" Justice Clarence Thomas was the sole dissent. The case involves a Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, who was accused of hitting his girlfriend during an argument in a parking lot and later threatening to shoot her if she told anyone about the assault. The girlfriend obtained a protective order against him in Tarrant County in February 2020. Eleven months later, Rahimi was a suspect in shootings when police searched his apartment and found guns. He eventually pleaded guilty to violating federal law. The federal appeals court in New Orleans overturned that conviction when it struck down the law following the Supreme Court’s Bruen decision in June 2022. That high court ruling not only expanded Americans’ gun rights under the Constitution but also changed the way courts are supposed to evaluate restrictions on firearms. The Biden Administration appealed. During oral arguments earlier this year, Justice Elena Kagan noted that “there seems to be a fair bit of division and a fair bit of confusion about what Bruen means and what Bruen requires in the lower courts.” That's because Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the majority opinion, tossed out the balancing test judges had long used to decide whether gun laws were constitutional. Rather than consider whether a law enhances public safety, judges should only weigh whether it fits into the nation’s history of gun regulation, Thomas wrote for the six conservative justices on the nine-member court. The Bruen decision has resulted in lower court rulings striking down more than a dozen laws. Those include age restrictions; bans on homemade ghost guns, which don’t have serial numbers; and prohibitions on gun ownership for people convicted of nonviolent felonies or using illegal drugs. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, defending the domestic violence law, argued that the prohibition fits within a long tradition of disarming people who are considered dangers to society and urged the justices to use this case to correct lower courts’ “profound misreading” of the decision. Justice Brett Kavanaugh voiced concern that a ruling for Rahimi could also jeopardize the background check system that the Democratic administration said has stopped more than 75,000 gun sales in the past 25 years based on domestic violence protective orders. Rahimi remains jailed in Texas, where he faces other criminal charges. In a letter he wrote from jail last summer, after the Supreme Court agreed to hear his case, Rahimi said he would “stay away from all firearms and weapons” once he’s released. The New York Times first reported the existence of the letter. Guns were used in 57% of killings of spouses, intimate partners, children or relatives in 2020, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Seventy women a month, on average, are shot and killed by intimate partners, according to the gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety.",

This decision comes amid a turbulent political debate concerning firearms, creating a challenging environment for passing new gun laws. State and federal laws prohibiting gun ownership have faced increasing scrutiny from the courts.The high court's decision could support similar gun regulations, which have been questioned in courts since the court expanded gun rights in 2022. This previous ruling led to confusion among lower court judges handling Second Amendment lawsuits.Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, emphasizing that traditionally, gun regulations have allowed the U.S. government to disarm individuals who present a credible threat to others.\"Our tradition of firearm regulation allows the government to disarm individuals who present a credible threat to the physical safety of others,\" he wrote.Steve Vladeck, CNN's Supreme Court analyst, commented that the ruling \"leaves intact a specific federal criminal prohibition on gun possession by those subject to domestic violence-related restraining orders.\" He also noted that more federal and state gun regulations have come under scrutiny since the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling on the Bruen case. Vladeck added that more difficult cases, such as those questioning whether Congress can prohibit all drug offenders or all felons from possessing guns, are likely to arise.Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the notable decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, filed a lone dissent in the recent decision.\"The Court and Government do not point to a single historical law revoking a citizen's Second Amendment right based on possible interpersonal violence,\" Thomas wrote in his dissent.\"Yet, in the interest of ensuring the Government can regulate one subset of society, today's decision puts at risk the Second Amendment rights of many more,\" he added.CBS News reported that the recent ruling was welcomed by President Joe Biden and gun violence prevention groups.",

                    "text": "In their first Second Amendment case since they expanded gun rights in 2022, the justices ruled 8-1 in favor of a 1994 ban on firearms for people under restraining orders to stay away from their spouses or partners. The justices reversed a ruling from the federal appeals court in New Orleans that had struck down the law. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the court, said the law uses “common sense” and applies only “after a judge determines that an individual poses a credible threat” of physical violence. Justice Clarence Thomas, the author of the major 2022 Bruen ruling in a New York case, dissented. President Joe Biden, who has been critical of previous high-court rulings on guns, abortion and other hot-button issues, praised the outcome. “No one who has been abused should have to worry about their abuser getting a gun,” Biden said in a statement. “As a result of today’s ruling, survivors of domestic violence and their families will still be able to count on critical protections, just as they have for the past three decades.” Bump stocks are acceptable Last week, the court overturned a Trump-era ban on bump stocks, the rapid-fire gun accessories used in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The court ruled that the Justice Department exceeded its authority in imposing that ban. Friday’s case stemmed directly from the Supreme Court’s Bruen decision in June 2022. A Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, was accused of hitting his girlfriend during an argument in a parking lot and later threatening to shoot her. At arguments in November, some justices voiced concern that a ruling for Rahimi could also jeopardize the background check system that the Biden administration said has stopped more than 75,000 gun sales in the past 25 years based on domestic violence protective orders. The case also had been closely watched for its potential to affect cases in which other gun ownership laws have been called into question, including in the high-profile prosecution of Hunter Biden. Biden’s son was convicted of lying on a form to buy a firearm while he was addicted to drugs. His lawyers have signaled they will appeal. A decision to strike down the domestic violence gun law might have signaled the court’s skepticism of the other laws as well. But Friday’s decision did not suggest that the court would necessarily uphold those law either. The justices could weigh in soon in one or more of those other cases. Many of the gun law cases grow out of the Bruen decision. That high court ruling not only expanded Americans’ gun rights under the Constitution but also changed the way courts are supposed to evaluate restrictions on firearms. Roberts: History on our side Roberts turned to history in his opinion. “Since the founding, our nation’s firearm laws have included provisions preventing individuals who threaten physical harm to others from misusing firearms,” he wrote. Some courts have gone too far, Roberts wrote, in applying Bruen and other gun rights cases. “These precedents were not meant to suggest a law trapped in amber,” he wrote. In dissent, Thomas wrote, the law “strips an individual of his ability to possess firearms and ammunition without any due process.” The government “failed to produce any evidence” that the law is consistent with the nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation, he wrote. “Not a single historical regulation justifies the statute at issue,” Thomas wrote. Seven of the nine justices wrote opinions in the guns case spanning 94 pages, mainly focused on the proper use of history in evaluating gun restrictions and other limitations on constitutional rights. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that Roberts’ opinion “permits a historical inquiry calibrated to reveal something useful and transferable to the present day, while the dissent would make the historical inquiry so exacting as to be useless.” She was among the three liberal justices who dissented in the Bruen case. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was part of the Bruen majority, noted that the court probably will have many more cases about the reach of gun rights because “Second Amendment jurisprudence is in its early innings.” It was only in 2008 that the court declared for the first time that the Constitution protects an individual’s right to keep and bear arms. Five shootings in two months Rahimi’s case reached the Supreme Court after prosecutors appealed a ruling that threw out his conviction for possessing guns while subject to a restraining order. Rahimi was involved in five shootings over two months in and around Arlington, Texas, U.S. Circuit Judge Cory Wilson noted. When police identified Rahimi as a suspect in the shootings and showed up at his home with a search warrant, he admitted having guns in the house and being subject to a domestic violence restraining order that prohibited gun possession, Wilson wrote. But even though Rahimi was hardly “a model citizen,” Wilson wrote, the law at issue could not be justified by looking to history. That’s the test Justice Thomas laid out in his opinion for the court in Bruen. The appeals court initially upheld the conviction under a balancing test that included whether the restriction enhances public safety. But the panel reversed course after Bruen. At least one district court has upheld the law since the Bruen decision. After the ruling, Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department “will continue to enforce this important statute, which for nearly 30 years has helped to protect victims and survivors of domestic violence from their abusers.” “As the Justice Department argued, and as the Court reaffirmed today, that commonsense prohibition is entirely consistent with the Court’s precedent and the text and history of the Second Amendment,” Garland said in a statement. Advocates for domestic violence victims and gun control groups had called on the court to uphold the law. Firearms are the most common weapon used in homicides of spouses, intimate partners, children or relatives in recent years, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Guns were used in more than half, 57%, of those killings in 2020, a year that saw an overall increase in domestic violence during the coronavirus pandemic. Seventy women a month, on average, are shot and killed by intimate partners, according to the gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety. Gun rights groups backed Rahimi, arguing that the appeals court got it right when it looked at American history and found no restriction close enough to justify the gun ban. ___ Associated Press writers Fatima Hussein, Alanna Durkin Richer and Lindsay Whitehurst contributed to this report.",

                    "text": "June 21 (UPI) -- The U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling Friday that affirmed the government's authority to prohibit domestic abusers from owning guns. The court ruled 8-1 in favor of upholding the federal law that bars people under restraining orders as a result of domestic violence from possessing a firearm. The decision came down in the case U.S. vs Rahimi, following a complaint by respondent Zackey Rahimi. The Texas man was accused of assaulting a woman who is the mother of his child in 2019. She was granted a restraining order against him in 2020 and he was later connected to multiple shootings. Rahimi argued that restricting him from having a gun based on a protective order against him is a violation of his second amendment right. The ruling was a win for the Biden Justice Department, which appealed a lower courts ruling that called the statute unconstitutional. Embattled Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was the lone dissenting opinion. The justices were not in complete agreement on the rationale behind their decisions. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion but five justices wrote concurring opinions. Roberts' opined that the government is within its right to prevent \"individuals who threaten physical harm to others from misusing firearms.\" The majority stopped short of fully embracing the restriction as it is written. Roberts objected to the government's argument that Rahimi may be disarmed because he is not \"responsible.\" Roberts wrote that the term \"responsible\" is \"too vague.\" Thomas argued that the restriction against domestic abusers is triggered without due process. He also writes that the government \"fails to carry its burden of proving that [the restriction] is 'consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.'\" The Supreme Court set a modern precedent in its 2022 ruling in the case New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. vs. Bruen. The majority opinion in that case, written by Thomas, stated that the government must prove that its regulations are \"consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.\" Roberts' opinion is that the Biden administration's policy \"fits comfortably within this tradition.\" Justice Amy Coney Barrett discussed in her concurring opinion the limits of viewing history through the originalist lens Thomas applies. \"It forces 21st-century regulations to follow late-18th-century policy choices, giving us 'a law trapped in amber,'\" she writes. \"And it assumes that founding-era legislatures maximally exercised their power to regulate, thereby adopting a 'use it or lose it' view of legislative authority. Such assumptions are flawed and originalism does not require them.\" It is the second time in little more than a week that Barrett, also a conservative judge, has pushed back on Thomas' view of the weight that should be given to history by the high court. \"Tradition has a legitimate role to play in constitutional adjudication,\" Barrett wrote in her opinion in the case Vidal vs. Elster. That case considered the use of a person's name -- in this instance, former President Donald Trump -- in a trademark without their consent. California attorney Steve Elster sought a trademark for the phrase \"Trump Too Small\" to be used on T-shirts that he was selling. \"In my view, the Court's laser-like focus on the history of this single restriction misses the forest for the trees,\" Barrett continued in her Elster opinion. \"Eventually, the Court will encounter a restriction without a historical analogue and be forced to articulate a test for analyzing it.\"",

In 2019, Zackey Rahimi physically assaulted his girlfriend in a parking lot in Texas and then told her that if she talked to the police about it, he would shoot her. Later, a state court granted her a domestic violence restraining order. Rahimi then threatened a different woman with a gun and was charged with assault with a deadly weapon. He shot guns in public on five more occasions, firing an AR-15 assault rifle into the home of someone who had once bought drugs from him and shooting into the air at a fast food restaurant when a friend’s credit card was declined. When police conducted a legal search of Rahimi’s home, they found multiple firearms and rounds of ammunition. Under a 1994 federal law, anyone with an active domestic violence restraining order against them is barred from possessing or purchasing firearms. Rahimi was charged with violating that law. In June 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen that any restriction on firearms must be “consistent with the Nation’s historical tradition” — meaning that it must have a point of reference rooted in the time of the Constitution’s signing. At the time of America’s founding, domestic violence restraining orders did not exist — nor were women, who are disproportionately impacted by domestic violence, considered full citizens. Thomas wrote that this precedent superseded the long-standing practice of allowing the government to weigh its interest in public safety against the possibility of imposing a limitation on Second Amendment rights. As a result of this ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit reversed its original conviction of Rahimi, saying a domestic violence restraining order could not be used to justify restricting Rahimi’s right to bear arms. “Our country has stood at a tipping point, with the safety of survivors of domestic violence on the line. But today, we took a step toward protecting millions from their abusers,” said Janet Carter, senior director of issues and appeals at Everytown Law, in a statement after the decision. “This is a major victory for gun safety in the courts, but make no mistake — we should not have been here in the first place. Lower court judges should never have been allowed to put their interpretation of early American history ahead of the lives of countless women and families across the country.” A domestic violence restraining order is a protective measure issued by a civil court. While the specifications of what these orders do can vary by state, they generally require a person accused of abuse to stop harming or threatening a victim; stay physically away from a victim’s home, workplace and school; and cease all communication with a victim. To receive such an order, an accuser must petition a civil judge and provide evidence. Civil courts’ evidentiary standard is a “preponderance of evidence,” a burden of proof below what is required for a conviction in criminal courts. If a judge finds that a preponderance of evidence shows proof of abuse, stalking, harassment or any other form of domestic or intimate partner violence, they will grant the accuser a domestic violence restraining order. Women, LGBTQ+ people and those from marginalized backgrounds are disproportionately impacted by domestic violence. Women in the United States are 11 times more likely to be killed with a firearm than women in other high-income countries, female intimate partners are more likely to be killed with a gun than all other means combined, and the presence of a gun increases the risk of homicide for women in domestic violence situations by 500 percent. One in 4 women in the United States has been the victim of severe domestic violence injury in her lifetime, and 1 in 3 women in the United States has experienced rape, stalking or domestic violence. “Today’s decision from the Supreme Court is a powerful reminder that the gun lobby cannot — and will not — be the arbiter of the lives of women and families across the country,” said Angela Ferrell-Zabala, executive director of Moms Demand Action, in a statement released after the decision. “Our movement has been fighting against the gun lobby’s extreme agenda for over a decade, and made it known that this decision would have had deadly consequences.”",

Rahimi saw the court reject a challenge from gun rights activists who claimed that confiscating firearms violates the Second Amendment. Chief Justice John Roberts noted in the court's opinion that he and his colleagues had \"no trouble\" reaching their decision. \"Our tradition of firearm regulation allows the Government to disarm individuals who present a credible threat to the physical safety of others,\" Roberts wrote. Clarence Thomas was the only Supreme Court justice to dissent. President Joe Biden — whose famed 1994 Senate crime bill touched on issues of gun safety and domestic violence — released a lengthy statement following Friday's ruling. \"No one who has been abused should have to worry about their abuser getting a gun,\" he said. \"As a result of today’s ruling, survivors of domestic violence and their families will still be able to count on critical protections, just as they have for the past three decades.\" Vice President Kamala Harris, who oversees the inaugural White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, also lauded the decision in a statement and warned of how fragile gun safety laws have become. “This case is yet another reminder that some want to take our country back to a time when women were not treated as equal to men and were not allowed to vote — and husbands could subject their wives to physical violence without it being considered a crime,\" Harris said.",

                    "text": "Every 16 hours in the US, a woman is gunned down in an act of domestic violence. Nearly 1 million American women have been shot or shot at by a current or former intimate partner; some 4.5 million have been threatened with a gun. Those appalling numbers would be even higher if Congress hadn’t enacted laws over the past 50 years prohibiting certain categories of abusers from possessing firearms, the leading cause of death in domestic violence homicides. Now, in an 8 to 1 decision that is likely to have sweeping ramifications for other gun rights cases going forward, the Supreme Court has rejected an argument that could have gutted one of those protections for abused women and children, ruling that people who have domestic-violence restraining orders filed against them are banned from having guns. Read the opinion here. The decision in US v. Rahimi, authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, upheld a 1994 federal law aimed at safeguarding victims of intimate partner violence for whom obtaining a protection order is both a vital step in breaking free from an abuser—and an act of empowerment that can increase an abuser’s rage. The court found that the prohibition on gun possession for people subject to restraining orders is consistent with the Second Amendment as interpreted by conservative justices in a landmark 2022 ruling. “When an individual has been found by a court to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another, that individual may be temporarily disarmed consistent with the Second Amendment,” Roberts wrote. “Some courts have misunderstood the methodology of our recent Second Amendment cases,” Roberts added. “These precedents were not meant to suggest a law trapped in amber.” Otherwise, he wrote, the Second Amendment would only provide protection to “muskets and sabers.” In her concurring opinion, Justice Amy Coney Barrett noted, “Despite its unqualified text, the Second Amendment is not absolute.” The decision comes just a week after the court’s conservative supermajority threw out a ban on bump stocks, firearms accessories that for all intents and purposes, transform semi-automatic rifles into machine guns. Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the bump stock ruling, was the sole dissenter in the Rahimi case. His dissent contends that “Not a single historical regulation justifies the statute at issue,” adding, “in the interest of ensuring the Government can regulate one subset of society, today’s decision puts at risk the Second Amendment rights of many more.” Today’s ruling comes at a time when intimate partner homicides have been soaring in the US—up 22 percent since 2018, according to a new analysis by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. As my Mother Jones and Reveal colleagues have reported, the increase in domestic violence gun deaths has been fueled by the pandemic and by red-state legislation that make it easier to purchase firearms, to carry them in public, and to claim self-defense even when the shooter is the aggressor. The toll is horrific—in addition to intimate partners, victims frequently include children, other family members, police officers, and bystanders. A 2019 Mother Jones investigation found that misogyny, stalking of women, and domestic violence have factored into numerous mass shootings. But women are at the greatest risk: They are five times more likely to be killed in a domestic violence incident if the abuser owns a gun—and 21 times more likely to be murdered by a firearm in the US than women in other countries. Public health researchers have understood the risks to abused women for decades, enacting a series of laws intended to make them safer. The Gun Control Act of 1968 makes it illegal for people convicted of a felony to possess a firearm. A quarter-century later, as part of the Violence Against Women Act, Congress barred people subject to family violence protection orders from having firearms. Two years after that, lawmakers expanded the federal gun restrictions to include some people convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors. Those laws are credited with significantly reducing intimate partner homicides starting in the mid-1990s. But about a decade ago, the number of such killings started to rise again. According to researchers, the increase has been driven exclusively by easier access to firearms—and by the failure of police, prosecutors, and courts to take guns away from people who are prohibited by law from possessing them. At the center of today’s Supreme Court decision is a Texas man named Zackey Rahimi who epitomizes the type of toxic masculinity that my Mother Jones colleague Mark Follman has found to be a throughline in many acts of gun violence. In December 2019, Rahimi assaulted his then-girlfriend in a parking lot, dragged her by her hair into his car, smashed her head on the dashboard, and fired his gun at a bystander who tried to intervene. The girlfriend escaped and obtained a protective order barring Rahimi from having any contact with her or their young son for two years. The restraining order also suspended his handgun license and prohibited him from possessing a firearm under the 1994 law. Rahimi violated the restraining order repeatedly over the next few months and faced state charges at least twice, only to be freed on bail. Federal authorities finally took action after he went on a two-month rampage in late 2020 and early 2021, terrorizing people in five separate incidents. According to the federal government’s petition to the Supreme Court, in one of these attacks, “after someone who had bought drugs from [Rahimi] ‘started talking trash’ on social media, he went to the man’s home and fired bullets into it using an AR-15 rifle.” In another incident, “Rahimi pulled out a gun and fired multiple shots in the air after a friend’s credit card was declined at a fast-food restaurant.” A search of Rahimi’s home after the spree turned up a .45-caliber pistol, a .308-caliber rifle, pistol and rifle magazines, ammunition, about $20,000 in cash, and a copy of the restraining order. A federal grand jury indicted him on charges of illegally possessing a firearm, punishable at the time by up to 10 years in prison (now 15 years). From the beginning, Rahimi’s lawyers argued that banning him from having a firearm violated his Second Amendment rights. But Rahimi ultimately pleaded guilty to the gun charge, receiving a six-year prison sentence. The ultra-conservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the conviction. There his case might have ended. But in June 2022, in a sweeping ruling authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court threw out a New York state law that required anyone who wanted a concealed handgun license to show a “special need” for self-protection. More fundamentally, the decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen upended the way gun-safety laws are evaluated under the Second Amendment. According to Thomas’s ruling, in order to pass constitutional muster, gun restrictions must be “consistent with the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.” Rahimi’s case was reopened, and this time the Fifth Circuit lived up to its far-right reputation. In the 3-0 ruling in March 2023, Trump-appointed appeals court judge Cory T. Wilson conceded that preventing domestic abuse is a “laudable policy goal.” But the federal government’s logic about disarming “non-law-abiding people” went too far, he wrote. “Could speeders be stripped of their right to keep and bear arms?” he fretted. “Political nonconformists? People who do not recycle or drive an electric vehicle?” That mind-boggling decision became one of the first Second Amendment cases to go before the Supreme Court since Bruen—and was widely seen as an opportunity for the justices to clarify Bruen’s controversial, and confusing, history-focused test. The problem with applying Thomas’s analysis to domestic violence cases, many commentators pointed out, is that the “nation’s historical traditions” didn’t include protecting women from abusive men. To the contrary: Under Anglo-American common law, “a husband had a legal right to subject his wife to physical violence if she defied his authority,” the Brady Center pointed out in an amicus brief. “It was not the place of the state to intervene to prevent this violence.” Even so, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the Supreme Court in oral arguments last fall, “throughout our nation’s history, legislatures have disarmed those who have committed serious criminal conduct or whose access to guns poses a danger.” She also noted that, all too often, “the only difference between a battered woman and a dead woman is the presence of a gun.” Given the facts of Rahimi’s case, it was an argument that seemed to resonate with the majority of justices. In his majority decision, Roberts said that early English and early American gun laws “confirm what common sense suggests: When an individual poses a clear threat of physical violence to another, the threatening individual may be disarmed.” In a concurring opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Elena Kagan, reiterated her belief that Bruen was wrongly decided. She wrote that she “welcome[s]” the extent to which today’s ruling “clarifies Bruen’s historical inquiry” but added that she “remain[s] troubled by Bruen’s myopic focus on history and tradition, which fails to give full consideration to the real and present stakes of the problem facing our society today.”",

                    "text": "Conservative bloc Alito – Majority Barrett – Majority Gorsuch – Majority Kavanaugh – Majority Roberts – Majority Thomas – Minority Liberal bloc Jackson – Majority Kagan – Majority Sotomayor – Majority The US supreme court has upheld a federal ban preventing anyone placed under a domestic violence restraining order from possessing a gun. The ruling in US v Rahimi, supported by eight justices to one, with Clarence Thomas dissenting, will leave in place legal protections against a major source of gun violence in America. Writing the opinion, the chief justice, John Roberts, said that individuals can be temporarily disarmed if they pose a “credible threat to the physical safety of another” without violating the second amendment to the constitution that allows the right to bear arms. “Since the founding, the nation’s firearm laws have included regulations to stop individuals who threaten physical harm to others from misusing firearms,” he wrote. The judgment will come as a relief to gun control advocates who had feared that the ability to disarm dangerous people might fall prey to the radical interpretation of the second amendment advanced by the court’s conservative supermajority. Merrick Garland, the US attorney general, welcomed the ruling as confirmation that “commonsense prohibition is entirely consistent” with the second amendment, adding that the justice department would “continue to enforce this important statute”. Gun control groups and individual victims of domestic violence shootings also expressed relief. La’Shea Cretain, a fellow with Everytown for Gun Safety who was herself shot by her former boyfriend in front of her young children and recovered from a coma, said the Rahimi ruling “means fewer children will witness their mothers, sisters, aunts and friends experience gun violence at the hands of abusers, like mine did”. Stakes in the Rahimi case were high, given the vast toll from armed domestic violence abusers. As the US solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar, pointed out in oral arguments in November, “a woman who lives in a house with a domestic abuser is five times more likely to be murdered if he has access to a gun”. Kelly Roskam, director of law and policy at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, responded after the ruling was delivered by saying it was in tune with clear research findings. “Armed domestic abusers are dangerous to their intimate partners, family, friends, law enforcement, and the broader community,” Roskam said. The decision from the chief justice comes as a rebuke to the fifth circuit court of appeals which had previously ruled that the ban on gun possession for those under domestic violence restraining orders was unconstitutional. The fifth circuit is the most hard-right appeals court in the country, and has been the crucible of several aggressive cases that have come before the supreme court, including the recent mifepristone case in which the justices also sided against the appeals court to uphold access to the abortion pill. Six of the 17 judges on the fifth circuit were appointed by Donald Trump. The Rahimi decision also sees the country’s most powerful court stepping back by a degree from the hardline vision of open access to guns that it had laid out two years ago in the landmark ruling New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v Bruen. In that case, the six conservative justices allowed handguns to be carried in public in most instances. They said that any restrictions on ownership had to conform to the “history and tradition” of firearms regulations stretching back to the 18th century. Gun control groups feared that the ruling might be used to unravel America’s already lax regulations, with potentially disastrous consequences. Now Roberts has clarified Bruen, smoothing down some of its roughest edges. He commented archly in his decision that “some courts have misunderstood the methodology of our recent second amendment cases. These precedents were not meant to suggest a law trapped in amber.” The Rahimi case focused on a drug dealer, Zackey Rahimi, who was placed under a restraining order after he abused his girlfriend in a parking lot in Texas and shot at a bystander. He was alleged to have been involved in five further shootings before he was arrested and found to have guns in his house in a breach of the ban on anyone under a domestic violence restraining order possessing firearms. Rahimi challenged the ban as unconstitutional, and won the backing of the fifth circuit court of appeal, prompting the case that has now been adjudicated by the supreme court. In his opinion, Roberts framed the decision to continue the ban on gun possession by those under a domestic violence order as “common sense”. He wrote: “When an individual poses a clear threat of physical violence to another, the threatening individual may be disarmed.” He added that such a view “fits within the nation’s regulatory tradition”. Thomas made clear his displeasure with his eight peers on the court by issuing a 32-page dissent. In it he restated the formula laid out by him and his fellow hard-right justices that gun prohibitions could only be constitutional under the second amendment if they are “consistent with the nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation”. “Not a single historical regulation justifies the statute at issue,” he complained.",

                    "text": "The Supreme Court, in an 8-to-1 decision, ruled today that the government can take guns away from people subject to restraining orders for domestic violence. The decision ended a 16-year streak of major rulings expanding gun rights. In particular, a 2022 ruling from the court vastly expanded Second Amendment rights and created a new test to assess gun laws by looking at historical practices to judge their constitutionality. Using that test, a federal judge had ruled that it was unconstitutional to take guns from domestic abusers. But today, Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, said that Second Amendment rights do have limits. “When a restraining order contains a finding that an individual poses a credible threat to the physical safety of an intimate partner, that individual may — consistent with the Second Amendment — be banned from possessing firearms,” he wrote. Justice Clarence Thomas, the author of the majority opinion in the 2022 decision, was the only dissenter. He argued that the government has a better way to disarm dangerous people: by prosecuting them for criminal violence.",

                    "text": "FORDYCE, Ark. (AP) — Two people were killed and six wounded, including one law enforcement officer, when a shooter opened fire Friday at a grocery store in Arkansas, police said. The shooting occurred at the Mad Butcher grocery store in Fordyce. The suspected shooter was critically injured after being shot by police, Arkansas State Police said. An officer was among those shot but did not have life-threatening injuries. Police did not immediately say whether the shooting occurred inside or outside the store. Authorities planned to hold a news briefing on the shooting later Friday afternoon. Fordyce is a city of about 3,200 people located 65 miles (104 kilometers) south of Little Rock. Video posted on social media showed at least one person lying in the parking lot, while another captured multiple gunshots ringing out. Images from TV reporters on the scene showed a slew of bullet holes in the grocery store’s window. In video footage, local and state agencies could be seen responding to the scene, with at least one medical helicopter landing nearby. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she had been briefed on the shooting. “I am thankful to law enforcement and first responders for their quick and heroic action to save lives,” Sanders posted on the social media platform X. “My prayers are with the victims and all those impacted by this.” It’s the latest mass shooting to have a grocery store as its backdrop. A white supremacist in 2022 killed 10 Black people at a Buffalo supermarket. That shooting came a little more than a year after one at a Boulder, Colorado, supermarket, where 10 people were killed. David Rodriguez, 58, had stopped at his local gas station in Fordyce to fill up his car when he heard what he thought were fireworks from a nearby vendor’s stand. “We heard a few little pops,” he said. He then saw people running from the Mad Butcher grocery store into the parking lot, and one person lying on the ground. He began recording video with his phone before the gunfire escalated. “The police started to show up, and then there was massive gunfire and ambulances pulling up,” he said. “The bullets were just flying.” ___ This story has been updated to correct the number of people wounded in the shooting. Arkansas State Police originally reported eight people had been wounded, but later Friday they lowered that number to six.",

Two law enforcement officers were among the wounded, but their wounds are non-life-threatening, Hager said. The shooter is in custody after exchanging gunfire with state police. Hager said the victims' wounds range from non-life-threatening to critical. SHOOTING AT OAKLAND JUNETEENTH CELEBRATION LEAVES MULTIPLE INJURED, POLICE SAY \"It’s tragic, our hearts are broken,\" Hager told reporters. A witness, who works at Holt Builder's Supply across the street from the shooting at the Mad Butcher grocery store, told Fox News Digital he heard \"several rounds\" and saw victims being medevaced from the scene. The employee said, \"multiple agencies were down here trying to figure out what was going on. We saw policemen running around the pharmacy, which is right next door to the Mad Butcher.\" He added, \"It was pretty hectic around here between 11:30 and noon\" and that he saw a medevac land at the local hospital's helipad. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee-Sanders said on social media that she had been \"briefed on the tragic shooting in Fordyce, and I’m in constant contact with State Police at the scene. I am thankful to law enforcement and first responders for their quick and heroic action to save lives. My prayers are with the victims and all those impacted by this horrific incident.\" A witness named Odis Allen told FOX 16 he has lived in Fordyce for 60 years and was completely \"shocked\" by the shooting. \"I never saw something like this happen in Fordyce, Arkansas,\" he told the station, adding he was scared for his children and grandchildren. Another witness told FOX 16 that the shooter had \"destroyed a community today.\" \"I wish people would spread more love instead of hate,\" he added. David Rodriguez, who was getting gas nearby, told the Associated Press he at first thought he had heard fireworks. Rodriguez said he then saw people running from the Mad Butcher grocery store into the parking lot, and one person lying on the ground. PROMISING BOXER, 27, VICTIM OF TARGETED SHOOTING OUTSIDE BALTIMORE Roderick Rogers, a local pastor, told FOX 16 he got a call from some of his members that they were near the shooting, and he contacted the mayor and police to respond. He said he's lived in Fordyce his whole life and \"never in a million years\" did he think something like that would happen in the small town. \"Let's continue to pray for all involved.

                    "text": "FORDYCE, Ark. (AP) — Two people were killed and six wounded, including one law enforcement officer, when a shooter opened fire Friday at a grocery store in Arkansas, police said. The shooting occurred at the Mad Butcher grocery store in Fordyce. The suspected shooter was critically injured after being shot by police, Arkansas State Police said. An officer was among those shot but did not have life-threatening injuries. Police did not immediately say whether the shooting occurred inside or outside the store. Authorities planned to hold a news briefing on the shooting later Friday afternoon. Fordyce is a city of about 3,200 people located 65 miles (104 kilometers) south of Little Rock. Video posted on social media showed at least one person lying in the parking lot, while another captured multiple gunshots ringing out. Images from TV reporters on the scene showed a slew of bullet holes in the grocery store’s window. In video footage, local and state agencies could be seen responding to the scene, with at least one medical helicopter landing nearby. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she had been briefed on the shooting. “I am thankful to law enforcement and first responders for their quick and heroic action to save lives,” Sanders posted on the social media platform X. “My prayers are with the victims and all those impacted by this.” It’s the latest mass shooting to have a grocery store as its backdrop. A white supremacist in 2022 killed 10 Black people at a Buffalo supermarket. That shooting came a little more than a year after one at a Boulder, Colorado, supermarket, where 10 people were killed. David Rodriguez, 58, had stopped at his local gas station in Fordyce to fill up his car when he heard what he thought were fireworks from a nearby vendor’s stand. “We heard a few little pops,” he said. He then saw people running from the Mad Butcher grocery store into the parking lot, and one person lying on the ground. He began recording video with his phone before the gunfire escalated. “The police started to show up, and then there was massive gunfire and ambulances pulling up,” he said. “The bullets were just flying.” (Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

It is the latest mass shooting involving a grocery store. A white supremacist in 2022 killed 10 Black people at a Buffalo supermarket; that incident came a little more than a year after a shooting at a Boulder, Colorado, supermarket, where 10 people were killed. There had been at least 234 mass shootings in the US so far this year as of Friday – an average of more than one daily, according to the Gun Violence Archive. The non-partisan online resource defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more victims are wounded or killed. Such a high rate of mass shootings in the US has driven some in the country to call for more substantial, meaningful gun control. But the federal government has mostly been unable or unwilling to heed those calls.

A news release from the Arkansas State Police (ASP) said authorities responded to a shooting at the Mad Butcher grocery store in Fordyce, Ark., just south of Little Rock. The shooter, who was shot by an officer and suffered non-life-threatening injuries, is now in custody, Mike Hagar, Secretary of Public Safety and Director of ASP, said during a news briefing shortly after the shooting. \"This situation is secure and contained,\" Hagar said, adding, \"There are no active threats to the community.\" After being alerted to shots fired at the grocery store, officers \"responded immediately in the exchange of gunfire with a lone suspect,\" Hagar said. Eleven \"innocent civilians\" had been shot, and three have died, Hagar said. He added that two officers were injured during an \"exchange of gunfire.\" The officers' and suspect's injuries are not life-threatening, said Hagar. The civilians' injuries range from non-life-threatening to \"severely critical,\" he added. The investigation is ongoing, Hagar said, adding that no further information is known at this time. The ASP is leading the investigation. According to local news outlset KATV, Fordyce City Counselor Roderick Rogers called 911. \"This is a very devastating day for us,\" Rogers told KATV. \"Never in a million years would we think something like this would happen. It's a lot of families involved that's affected, so just continue to pray for them.\" Sisters Amiya and Ashia Doherty, also witnessed the shooting, told KATV, \"I was really scared like I will never think that will happen in Fordyce. That's real scary and I pray for the man to you know because something has triggered him but yeah, I'm just glad I'm okay and my family okay, but I do want to pray for the ones who got hurt.\" Another witness, David Rodriguez, who filmed the scene, told local outlet 5NewsOnline that he thought he heard fireworks. When he saw people running from the grocery store, he started recording with his phone. \"The police started to show up,\" Rodriguez told the outlet. \"Then there was massive gunfire and ambulances pulling up... the bullets were just flying.\" Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

However, she noted that while the actor’s build may have been intimidating, he was anything but that in real life. “He would look physically menacing until you just folded right into a hug, and that was it,” she shared. “My heart is breaking.” Wily was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1968 and started as a sumo wrestler under the name “Takamishu,” per his IMDb page. TV Insider reported that he won his first 14 matches before becoming the first foreign-born wrestler to win the championship in the third-highest Makushita division. He then competed in the first match held in Ultimate Fighting Championship (2000), where he fought UFC fighter Gerard Gordeau and became the first fighter to lose a UFC brawl.

He was 56. Wily’s death on June 20 was confirmed by TV producer Peter M. Lenkov, executive producer on the Hawaii Five-0 reboot. The network hit ran for a decade after premiering to a strong reception in 2010. On the show, Wily played Kamekona Tupuola, a shrimp truck owner and informant providing intel to the Five-0 Task Force. On Instagram, Lenkov wrote of his shock at the news of his friend’s death, then shared a heartfelt note directed to Wily. “I am devastated. Heartbroken. I’ll post some detailed feelings later. Just too hard right now,” Lenkov wrote in an initial post. Later in a second post, the producer who also brought reboots of 1980s favorites Mcgyver and Magnum P.I. to the network, wrote, “T, as I told you many times, I fell in love with you at the first audition. You came in with a towel on your head mopping up sweat, and I was smitten. You charmed me into making you a regular… on the show… and in my life. You were family. And I will miss you every day, brother. “PS: when we spoke last week, we laughed at how right you were from Day 1. Five-0 was our dream job. And I was so lucky we got to share that magic together,” he concluded. Hailing from Laie, Hawaii, Wily — who stood 6’2” and weighed 450 pounds, was recruited in 1987 into the Azumazeki stable of sumo, the century-spanning national sport of Japan. Wily, who wrestled under the name Takamikuni, was undefeated in his first 14 matches and soon became the first foreign-born wrestler to win the championship in the sport’s makushita division. Two years after starting his career in the sport, Takamikuni reached the rank of makushita 2; however, he declined to pursue sumo further after knee issues developed. In addition to his decade on Hawaii Five-0, Wily appeared as a bartender who befriends Jason Segel’s lovelorn main character in the comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall; he also appeared on an episode of The Amazing Race. Wily is survived by his wife Halona and their two children.",

                    "text": "Hawaii Five-0 actor Taylor Wily, who played Kamekona across ten seasons of the hit CBS reboot, died on Thursday (June 20) at the age of 56. The news of his passing was shared on KITV 4 Island News on Thursday, per TV Insider, where Lina Girl Langi, a Hawaiian musician, revealed that Wily had died in Hurricane, Utah. Further details of his passing were not immediately available. Wily was born Teila Tuli on June 14, 1968, per Deadline. According to the outlet, he was a sumo wrestler and MMA fighter before taking on a career in acting. He competed with the name Takamishu, emerging victorious in his first 14 official matches, and would eventually become the first foreign-born wrestler to secure the championship in the third-highest Makushita division, per TV Insider. He lost to Gerard Gordeau in the first ever Ultimate Fighting Championships in 2000, per People. One of Wily’s first TV appearances was an uncredited role on Magnum P.I. in 1982 as “Guy Outside Pool Hall,” per IMDb. He would later reprise his Hawaii Five-0 role in seven episodes of the 2018 Magnum P.I. reboot. Among his other on-screen credits were Marker, One West Waikiki, North Shore, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, MacGyver, and Radical. The writers behind Magnum P.I. mourned Wily’s death on X, writing on Friday, “So sorry to hear about the passing of Taylor Wily. Taylor was a gentle giant and a sweet soul. He will be missed. RIP Taylor.” The executive producer of both the Hawaii Five-0 and Magnum P.I. reboots, Peter M. Lenkov, took to Instagram to honor Wily, noting that he’s “devastated” and “heartbroken” over his passing. He shared another post, per Deadline, featuring a video montage of pictures, explaining that he “fell in love with [Wily] at the first audition” and that he “charmed [him] into making [him] a regular… on the show… and in [his] life.”",

Wily only had one professional MMA fight, entering UFC 1 on the strength of his sumo background. But that one fight turned out to be one of the most memorable in the promotion's history. That fight may have been as important as any other on the show, though it went poorly for Wily. Gerard Gordeau knocked him out in less than 30 seconds in the opening round of the event's tournament, landing a head kick that created an iconic moment as three of Wily's teeth were dislodged, with one visibly flying toward the crowd and two reportedly lodged into Gordeau's foot. As the first UFC fight seen by the masses -- there had been a tournament alternate bout prior to the show's airing -- it set an immediate and shocking tone that established MMA as a completely different animal from boxing. After his fighting career came to a quick end, Wily went on to a successful career in acting. While Wily's most famous role is likely as the affable Kemo in \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" alongside Jason Segel, Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis, he also had major recurring roles in both the \"Hawaii Five-0\" and \"Magnum P.I.\"",

                    "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Taylor Wily, a former sumo wrestler who became known for his role as confidential informant Kamekona Tupuola on both “Hawaii Five-0” and “Magnum P.I,” has died, his friend and a “Hawaii Five-0” producer both said Friday. He was 56. “Hawaii Five-0” executive producer Peter M. Lenkov confirmed his death to The Associated Press and shared multiple tributes to the actor on Instagram, writing “I am devastated. Heartbroken” in a caption of a photo of the two. KITV 4, based in Honolulu, was the first to report Wily’s death on Thursday. Additional details about the cause remain unknown. TV and radio personality Lina Girl Langi said on the show “Island Life Live” that she announced the news “with a heavy heart,” as Wily was a friend. Lenkov, Wily’s longtime friend and collaborator, shared a second post later on Thursday with a video montage featuring photos and clips with Wily. He wrote, “You charmed me into making you a regular… on the show… and in my life. You were family. And I will miss you every day, brother.” In an additional statement to the AP, Lenkov said it was hard to describe how “special” Wily was and lauded the actor for his skills. “Despite the fact that a lot of his ‘Hawaii Five-0’ and ‘Magnum’ scenes featured his comedy skills, he was an incredible dramatic actor, as well,” Lenvok said. “I had developed a script a couple years back and wrote him a role and was hoping to put him in my next project. I just wanted to keep him close… not just as a friend, but as an artist. Devastated I won’t get that opportunity.” Wily played Kamekona on “Hawaii Five-0” from 2010 through 2020 and became a fan-favorite. He continued in the same role with the reboot of “Magnum P.I.” and made a memorable appearance as a hotel worker in the 2008 comedy “Forgetting Sarah Marshall.” Before he began acting, Wily, born Teila Tuli, was a well-known sumo wrestler and UFC 1 fighter. He became the first knockout victim in UFC history in 1993 when opponent Gerard Gordeau’s kick knocked a tooth clear out of Wily’s mouth, ending the fight after just 26 seconds. Wily is survived by his wife, Halona, and their two children.",

The book is divided into eight chapters, including one dedicated to “libations” and another to “sundries,” with recipes for pickles, remoulades and other staples.

Nourishing Recipes That Are Part African, Part Californian Amazon AfriCali: Recipes From My Jikoni Release date: August 13, 2024 True to its name, AfriCali is recipe developer and former BuzzFeed culinary producer Kiano Moju’s love letter to her Kenyan, Nigerian and Californian backgrounds. Moju’s recipes combine influences from her African heritage (her mom is Maasai-Kenyan and dad is Nigerian) with California’s bountiful produce, as well as accents from her travels around the world. She invites home cooks into her jikoni (that’s Swahili for kitchen) to make berbere braised short ribs, coriander katsu chicken and mango-ginger scones—and also offers peeks into her African travels through personal photos. Adaptable, Weekday-Friendly Meals For When You're Feeling Uninspired Amazon What To Cook When You Don't Feel Like Cooking Release date: August 13, 2024 If you find yourself constantly wondering what to cook for dinner, recipe developer Caroline Chambers is here to help.

There are fast and easy 15-minute meals like cheater chicken tinga tacos (plus more smart ways to use rotisserie chicken) and coconut curry ramen, but also ideas for when you have 30 minutes, 45 minutes or a full hour. A chapter titled “A Little Bit Longer” is designed for more leisurely days, featuring recipes such as slow cooker BBQ ribs with ranch-y potatoes and ratatouille lasagna. Creative, Layered Dishes Inspired By American Latino Cuisines Amazon Latin-Ish: More Than 100 Recipes Celebrating American Latino Cuisines Release date: August 20, 2024 Food writer Marisel Salazar makes it clear early on that this isn’t a Latin-American cookbook—rather, it’s one that looks at the way immigration and movement have created an entirely new category: Latin-Ish. Salazar’s recipes draw from culinary traditions such as Tex-Mex and Floribbean, plus her own Cuban heritage and globetrotting childhood (she was born in Panama and lived in Hawaii, Japan and northern Virginia). These influences come together in the form of Cuban pizza, collard green empanadas and guava cream cheese cinnamon rolls, each dish accompanied by vibrant step-by-step photography and stories of the Latin diaspora. Bright Recipes That Meld Flavors From Vietnam And The American South Amazon Đặc Biệt: An Extra-Special Vietnamese Cookbook Release date: August 27, 2024 The Vietnamese term “Đặc biệt” means “special,” an idea that chef Nini Nguyen translates into her culinary work by adding “finesse, technique, and thoughtfulness to every dish.” The Top Chef alum does so deftly in this book, which blends her Vietnamese heritage with her New Orleans upbringing. Dishes celebrate the vibrant flavors of Vietnam and the South with added elements of đặc biệt; for example, she tops charbroiled oysters with chili butter and garnishes squid-stuffed pork with caviar. But it doesn’t always have to be fancy. Nguyen makes broken rice with pork chops and crispy fish sauce-caramel chicken wings just as special. Modernized Classic Indonesian Recipes That Are Bright And Inviting Amazon Mortar & Pestle: Classic Indonesian Recipes For The Modern Kitchen Release date: August 27, 2024 Mortar & Pestle is a team effort by mother-daughter duo Juliana Evari Suparman and Patricia Tanumihardja.

Both are intimately knowledgeable about the island nation’s unique food culture, and together, they take readers through popular Indonesian dishes, broken into categories such as “Makanan Sederhana” (one-dish meals) and “Ayo Panggang!” (grilled favorites). Recipes for smashed chicken with green sambal and spice-rubbed whole fish are easy to follow, and there’s a section that takes readers through Indonesian pantry staples.

                    "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The best down pillows are a plush, luxurious option that you can use in any sleep position. You can mold these pillows, which are filled with fluffy feathers from geese’s and ducks’ undercoat, into the right shape for your head, and they last for years when cared for properly. While there are many down pillows out there today, our favorite option is the Parachute Down Pillow, which is available in three firmness options designed to suit any sleep position and comes with a three-year warranty. The best down pillows come in different firmnesses to fit your sleep style and comfort needs. Illustration: Forbes / Photo: Retailer Like other types of pillows, down pillows are available in different heights and densities, and you want to consider your sleep preferences while selecting one. Also, keep in mind that down can trigger some people’s allergies, in which case you may want to look for a down alternative pillow instead. No matter your sleep style or budget, we’ve put together a list of the best down pillows for a more luxurious night’s sleep. Best Down Pillow Overall: Parachute Down Pillow (Standard) Best Affordable Down Pillow: Lacrosse Feather & Down Pillow (Queen) Best Down Pillow For Back Sleepers: Brooklinen Down Pillow (Standard) Best Down Pillow On Amazon: Lincove Cloud Pillow (Standard) Best Down Pillow For Stomach Sleepers: Boll & Branch Down Pillow (Standard) Best Down Pillow For Combination Sleepers: Casper Down Pillow (Standard) Best Down Pillow For Side Sleepers: Plumeria Bay Cascade Made Goose Down Pillow (Standard) Best Down And Feather Pillow: Coyuchi Down Feather Pillow (Standard) Best Down Pillow Overall Soft, Fluffy And Available In Three Densities MOST POPULAR Parachute Parachute Down Pillow (Standard) Fill power: Not listed | Composition: Organic cotton, European white down, feather fibers | Certification: Responsible Down Standard, OEKO-TEX | Care: Machine wash on cold Pros: Comes with a 3-year warranty Available in soft, medium and firm options Affordable Cons: May require additional fluffing to help it maintain its shape Some density options on backorder We recommend the Parachute Down Pillow for most sleepers because it has the soft, fluffy feel down is known for without compromising on support. It’s made of 85% goose down and 15% down and feather fibers encased in a cotton shell. In our tester’s notes on loft and care, she found it retained its structure well (providing great support for the head and neck) and held up well against several rounds of washing and drying. For side sleepers, we advise opting for the medium to firm options, while back and stomach sleepers are better off with a soft or medium. We also like that the Parachute comes with a three-year warranty; should your pillow have any defects in the time frame, Parachute sends you a replacement at no extra cost. What the reviews say: “I have purchased many down pillows by different brands over the years, and this is the winner for me,” writes one reviewer, noting the pillow is “the perfect weight and softness.” Other users also note the pillow has helped decrease aches and pains in the morning: “I've noticed I'm not tossing and turning as much throughout the night, and it offers great support to avoid any neck pains.” Best Affordable Down Pillow Soft, Supportive And Easy On The Wallet The Company Store Lacrosse Feather & Down Pillow (Queen) Fill power: Not listed | Composition: Cotton, white down, white waterfowl feathers | Certification: Responsible Down Standard | Care: Machine washable Pros: Budget-friendly; under $100 Supportive for back and side sleepers Cons: Some reviewers found it to be underfilled The Lacrosse Feather and Down Pillow from The Company Store is a nice balance of softness and support, thanks to its two-chamber construction. An inner core of 98% feathers and 2% down is wrapped in an exterior chamber filled with down, so you get a soft and cushy pillow that doesn’t compromise on support. That inner core makes it a great choice for side and back sleepers in particular. Plus, at about $100 for a queen size, this pillow is one of the cheapest on our list and a great value for a responsibly sourced down product. What the reviews say: “It has a nice amount of filling and can be molded to your needs,” writes one reviewer. “It was softer than I was expecting, but I use it as a head and body pillow and love it so far.” Another buyer notes that, despite the reasonable price, the pillow is “soft and comfortable and provides great neck support.” Best Down Pillow For Back Sleepers A Great Balance Of Airy Softness And Neck Support Brooklinen Brooklinen Down Pillow (Standard) Fill power: Not listed | Composition: Cotton, down fill, Hutterite down clusters and feathers | Certification: Downmark, OEKO-TEX | Care: Dry clean Pros: Supportive yet soft Good loft for back sleepers Three plushness levels to choose from Cons: May be too stiff for some back/side combo sleepers Brooklinen’s Down Pillow comes in two sizes and three densities. For back sleepers, the middle of the road pick—which the company dubs “mid-plush”—has the airiness of down without compromising on support. It’s an essential combination for back sleepers to snooze comfortably all night. The pillow has a dual-core construction, with a firmer inner layer of feathers surrounded by another layer of soft down, which is sustainably sourced from Hutterite Farms in Canada. Brooklinen’s down pillows are treated with antimicrobial additives to keep them fresh, clean and odor-free for longer. What the reviews say: “Get this pillow. You won't be disappointed,” says one reviewer, who gives the pillow 5 stars. “The quality is obvious. You can feel the weight of the pillow and the comfortable cloud-like feel when you press on it. The pillow is not mushy and offers the perfect support for your head.” Others note that it can be adjusted to suit your sleep position: “It's firmer than most feather/down pillows, and I'm able to mold and shape it to suit depending on if I'm on my side or my back.” Best Down Pillow On Amazon Fast Shipping For Amazon Prime Members Amazon Lincove Cloud Pillow (Standard) Fill power: 625 | Composition: Cotton sateen, Canadian white down | Certification: Downmark | Care: Dry clean Pros: Three firmnesses to accommodate all sleeping positions Ships with two-day delivery for Prime members Cons: Some reviewers complained of feathers poking through the pillow Different sleep positions need different levels of support. With three density options, this Lincove down pillow delivers—regardless of how you sleep. The pillow comes in soft, medium and firm options to accommodate stomach, back and side sleepers, respectively. Each pillow is stuffed with Canadian down for a cloud-like feel (hence the name, according to the company). The sateen shell is double stitched for durability and to keep all that fluffy down safely tucked away. What the reviews say: “This is the most luxurious pillow I have ever had,” writes one verified buyer. “Dreamy, heavenly, soft and so very comfortable.” Several reviewers also note that the brand’s customer service is helpful if you need to return or exchange your pillow: “The process was incredibly easy, due to Melissa’s excellent customer service. Truly, she made my day with how helpful and polite she was.” Best Down Pillow For Stomach Sleepers An Ultra Cushy Option That Doesn't Hurt Your Neck Boll & Branch Boll & Branch Down Pillow (Standard) Fill power: 750-700 | Composition: Cotton, white down | Certification: International Down Standard | Care: Wash in cold water Pros: Ideal loft and firmness for stomach sleepers Soft version made entirely of down Cons: Some reviewers complain of an off-gassing smell Like other pillows on this list, the Boll & Branch Chamber Down Pillow comes in three densities to suit different sleep styles. We think the soft option is a great pick for stomach sleepers who prefer pillows that are marshmallowy soft and don’t awkwardly angle their necks. The down fill also makes the soft pillow pliable so you can adjust it to suit your needs. The medium and firm options have a three-chamber construction, which gives them a little boost of support and should keep the fill well distributed if you prefer a firmer pillow. The soft option is all down, instead of the down-and-feather blend you find in the other densities. That’s the reason it doesn’t rely on chamber construction, as down doesn’t tend to poke out of a pillow the same way feathers can. Boll & Branch pillows also have a sturdy organic cotton cover to minimize the risk of down or feathers escaping. The down is triple washed for a cleaner, long-lasting loft. What our editors say: “This pillow is dream worthy,” says former mattress and sleep editor Lindsey Vickers. “It quickly became one of my favorite pillows, as the soft version has the ideal level of cushion for me as a stomach sleeper. I find it has the give and compression that I love about down, but I’m also relieved the fill materials are ethically sourced because that’s equally important to me.” Best Down Pillow For Combination Sleepers A Five-Chamber Design With A Gusset Casper Casper Down Pillow (Standard) Fill power: Not listed | Composition: Cotton, polyester, white duck down, feather | Certification: N/A | Care: Machine washable Pros: Multi-chamber design provides better support Gusseted design for all sleep positions Machine washable Cons: No Responsible Down Standard certification If you tend to alternate between multiple sleep positions at night, the Casper Down Pillow is adjustable to suit all of them. It has a five-chamber design that helps keep down more evenly distributed, and the gusseted shape provides better support while sleeping on your side. The outer chambers of the pillow are filled with 80% white duck down and 20% feather for the right balance of support and loft, and while the pillow doesn’t have a Responsible Down Standard certification, the brand does note that the materials are ethically sourced. What the reviews say: “I’ve been cycling through pillows for months trying to find the right one,” says one reviewer. “The Casper Down Pillow is like sleeping on a cloud, and I can adjust it to fit the way I sleep for back, side and stomach sleeping.” Another combination sleeper notes that the pillow is “the perfect height for side and back sleeping.” Best Down Pillow For Side Sleepers A Generous Fill Power Delivers Fluffy Loft And Ample Support Plumeria Bay Plumeria Bay Cascade Made Goose Down Pillow (Standard) Fill power: 700 | Composition: Cotton, Hungarian white goose down | Certification: Responsible Down Standard | Care: Machine washable Pros: Loft and medium firmness is ideal for side sleepers Can adjust the fill after purchase if you’re not satisfied with it Available in body pillow and travel pillow sizes Cons: Some reviewers experienced an off-putting smell Cascade Made pillows come in a range of hard-to-find sizes (including travel and Euro square) and extra-soft to extra-firm densities. With its fluffy loft and ample support, the medium-firm option is a great pick for side sleepers. The 700 fill power is a measure of the down cluster size—the higher the number, the fluffier and more supportive the pillow. If you find that the pillow you bought is too soft or too firm within a year of purchase, the company adjusts it accordingly for the cost of shipping and any down added. It’s unusual to find a company that tinkers with fill levels, rather than just disposing of used pillows and sending an entirely new one. That makes this a more eco-conscious option as well. What the reviews say: “I love my soft down pillow,” notes one reviewer. “It is lofty with just the right amount of firmness/softness to sleep comfortably on my side.” Buyers also note that these pillows are made to last: “This is my second pillow from Pulmeria. My last one has lasted 10 years—still comfy but it was time for a new one.” Best Down And Feather Pillow Soft Without Feeling Too Squishy Coyuchi Coyuchi Down Feather Pillow (Standard) Fill power: Not listed | Composition: Cotton, down and feather from an Indiana duck farm | Certification: None | Care: Machine wash with cold water Pros: Plush yet supportive feel Medium-firm; good for side and back sleepers Cons: No Responsible Down Standard certification Some reviewers found it too flat for their liking Coyuchi’s Down Feather Pillow is another three-chamber option. The center is a blend of 80% down and 20% feathers, which is designed to provide internal structure, with an all-down fill on either side. That design gives it a soft feel that doesn’t veer into squishy territory. Instead, it has a medium-firm feel, and customers note that it holds its shape well. Despite not having a Responsible Down Standard certification, Coyuchi says its down comes from an Indiana duck farm that is routinely audited for well-being guidelines to ensure humane practices. The guidelines are reviewed every two years by animal welfare and bird behavior academics, so we felt comfortable including it in this round-up. What the reviews say: “This is my absolute favorite pillow,” says one reviewer. “The quality of these is excellent and perfect for side and back sleepers. The weight is just right, and they bounce back to the original shape with just a fluff.” Several people also note that the down and feather combo is a bit firmer than the pure down: “This pillow has the soft feel of a down pillow but offers more support.” MORE FROMFORBES VETTED The 13 Best Cookbooks Of Summer 2024 By Patty Lee Contributor Teva Aventrail Review: Can A Trail Running Sandal Go The Distance? By Cam Vigliotta Forbes Staff Why Trust Forbes Vetted The Forbes Vetted team includes several sleep experts who have thoroughly reviewed and tested dozens of pillows. In addition to down and down alternative pillows, we’ve covered memory foam and latex pillows, as well as a wide range of other bedding and sleep products. Forbes Vetted contributor and co-author of this story Jessica Timmons has extensive knowledge covering all things health and lifestyle, specifically sleep and wellness. She’s researched and written about everything from the best pillow top mattresses to the best anti-snore pillows. Our mattress and sleep editors Bridget Chapman and Mckenzie Dillon are both certified sleep science coaches who have years of experience testing and evaluating mattresses and bedding. This story is regularly updated for freshness and to incorporate any new products we’ve tested. It was last updated in June 2024 by contributor Camryn Rabideau with the addition of the Casper Down Pillow. How We Chose The Best Down Pillows There is no shortage of down pillows out there, but certain considerations make it easy to zero in on those that are made well. Here’s what we kept in mind as we rounded up our top contenders: Brand reputation: We looked for companies that have a positive reputation for high-quality products and ethical practices. Certifications: The pillows on our list are made with feathers and down that come from birds raised in compliance with strict animal welfare principles. Certifications from the Responsible Down Standard (RDS), the International Down Standard and Downmark all indicate high quality and an ethical approach to down throughout the entire supply chain. Customer reviews: We read through hundreds of reviews to see what real customers think about their pillows and only selected products that are well-rated with a high number of reviews. Price range: It’s true that down often makes for more expensive pillows than other fill materials, but we’ve included options at varying prices. Sleep position: A comfortable pillow needs to accommodate specific sleep positions, so we included options designed for all the different ways we snooze. What To Consider When Shopping For The Best Down Pillows Down pillows come in all shapes and sizes, and they have different sensations, too. From fill power to density, certifications to size, this is what you want to keep in mind as you shop. Sleep Position When selecting a down pillow—or any type of pillow for that matter—your preferred sleep position helps determine the best size and loft. Your pillow should support your head in a way that keeps your spine and neck in a natural position throughout the night. Back sleepers generally do best with plush, mid-height pillows that allow your head to sink in a bit—if your pillow is too firm or too high, your neck may bend upward during the night. Side sleepers should look for a pillow with a higher loft that fits comfortably in the gap between your shoulder and head. Finally, stomach sleepers should look for a low-profile pillow that offers cushioning without tilting your neck upward. Body Type Your body type can also play a role in your pillow selection. For instance, heavier individuals typically sink more into the mattress, which means you need a pillow with a lower loft to keep your spine in a neutral position. Down pillows are often beneficial in these instances, as you can squish them down to reduce their loft. Alternatively, if you have wider shoulders and sleep on your side, you need a taller-than-average pillow to keep your head propped up, and you likely want a pillow with higher loft power that maintains its height. Performance Over Time Down is a natural material, and it naturally compresses over time. That means down pillows can eventually flatten and lose their shape. Most manufacturers advise fluffing their products on a daily basis. A good shake or two, end to end and side to side, helps keep your pillow lofty as long as possible. Fill Power You may have seen fill power referenced on down jackets in relation to warmth, but it’s important for pillows for another reason. Fill power is a reference to the size of the down clusters. The higher the fill power, the larger the cluster. Bigger down clusters give a pillow an airier, softer feel and indicate the down is higher quality. Typically, down pillow fill power ranges from 350 to 700 and higher, with 600 and above considered good quality. Density This is another term for firmness, or how soft a pillow feels. While down pillows in general are soft and airy, they come in different densities to provide soft, medium or firm support and sensation. Your preferred sleep position can clue you in to the appropriate pillow density. Down Vs. Down And Feather We’ve included several “all-down” pillows on our list, but if you look at it technically, there’s actually no such thing as a 100% down pillow. Separating feathers from down clusters is incredibly time-consuming, difficult and expensive. Inevitably, down, feather and fiber end up in products that are sold as down. However, the Federal Trade Commission regulates down labeling, and all down pillows are required to have labels indicating the percentage of down used. Pillows sold as “down” must have at least 75% down, though if you sliced one open you’d likely still find a few errant feathers. The higher the percentage of down, the higher the price tag. Ethical Considerations When we talk about down pillows, we’re talking about materials that come from geese and ducks that are raised primarily for food purposes. Ensuring that these products are sourced in a humane manner is non-negotiable, so avoid down products that aren’t certified by RDS, IDS or Downmark. However, some people who follow a vegan lifestyle choose to avoid down altogether. Care And Maintenance Always check the label first, but in general, most manufacturers of down pillows recommend washing or dry cleaning their pillows annually or semi-annually to clean away dust mites, bacteria, dirt, stains, sweat and oil that accumulates. Most down pillows can be machine washed and tumbled dry, while others need to be professionally dry cleaned. Consult the brand website for your pillow to make sure you follow proper care and maintenance instructions. For your convenience, we included care instructions for each of the pillows on our list, but it’s not a bad idea to confirm by double-checking the label or brand website. How Long Do Down Pillows Last? One of the biggest benefits of down pillows is that they last significantly longer than other fill materials. When cared for properly, a high-quality down pillow can last for up to 10 years—as opposed to down alternative pillows, which often need to be replaced after one to three years. If your down pillow gets flat, all you have to do is fluff it up again to help the feathers regain their loft. To get the most life out of your down pillow, we also recommend covering it with a pillow protector to prevent stains and odors. How Much Should I Pay For A Down Pillow? Because down is naturally sourced from ducks and geese, it’s typically more expensive than pillows made from memory foam or down alternative materials. On average, expect to pay between $100 and $300 for a quality down pillow. Typically, a higher price tag correlates with a higher ratio of down, and ultimately, a softer, more fluffy pillow. That being said, you can still find quality options that feel just as soft for $150 or less, like the Brooklinen Down Pillow and the Coyuchi Down Feather Pillow. How Do You Wash Down Pillows? Down pillows are often a bit more complicated to clean than other types of pillows—if the fill isn’t dried properly, it can develop a musty odor that’s hard to get rid of. For this reason, it’s best to wash your down pillows sparingly and follow the brand’s guidelines exactly. Many brands recommend dry cleaning their down pillows, but there are some down products that are machine washable. Just be sure to dry them thoroughly before putting them back on your bed.",

Usually rated with a UPF 30-plus or even a UPF 50-plus (UPF is short for “ultraviolet protection factor,” FYI), the best sun shirts can mean the difference between an enjoyable time outdoors and a sunburn that ruins the rest of the vacation. While rarely stylish, sun shirts are always a good idea if you will be spending any appreciable time outside in the glow of our nearby star. The best sun shirts protect your skin from harsh UV ray and other irritations. ILLUSTRATION: FORBES / PHOTO: RETAILERS The best sun shirts not only protect you from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays, but they can also keep you cooler and drier. Most sun shirts are moisture-wicking and quick drying, so they pull sweat off of your body and let it evaporate out into the atmosphere, which leads to cooling, that being a natural result of the evaporative process. Therefore, even if your hike, paddling trip or outdoor DIY project will be largely in the shade, a sun shirt still might be a great garment for use on a warm day. Best Sun Shirt Overall: Patagonia Capilene Cool Daily Hoody Best Sun Shirt For Hiking: Cotopaxi Sombra Sun Hoodie Best Sun Shirt For Running: Columbia PFG Zero Rules Short Sleeve Shirt Best Sun Shirt For Fishing: Free Fly Elevate Hoodie Best Sun Shirt For Kids: Hanna Andersson Rash Guard Top Best Dress With Sun Protection: Line In The Sand Splash Around Sun & Swim Dress Best Value Sun Shirt: Roadbox Sun Protection Shirt Best Sun Shirt Overall From Trail To Beach To Mowing The Lawn Patagonia Patagonia Capilene Cool Daily Hoody Materials: Polyester | Weight: 6.3 ounces | UPF rating: 35 | Sizes: XS - XXXL Pros: Great for use on the water or on land Large hood for full coverage Made with at least 50% recycled material Cons: Looser fit not ideal for some activities like climbing or cycling The Capilene Cool Daily Hoody from Patagonia lives up to its name because you really could wear this shirt pretty much every day in the summer. It’s light and flexible enough for use during a hike or as you do yard work, and it dries out fast enough for fishing, paddling or even swimming. While it wicks away sweat and releases excess heat, it can by all means serve as a base layer for when temperatures drop on those summer nights, too. The “Capilene” part of the name refers to the fabric used to make the shirt itself, which is a largely recycled polypropylene that, thanks to its capillary effect, is superb at drawing moisture away from your body and releasing it out into the summer. The Capilene Cool Daily Hoody has very few seams, so you won’t experience chafing even with long wear during high levels of activity, and the fabric’s flexible multi-direction stretch won’t limit your range of motion in any direction. There are lighter sun shirts that might be better suited to a long summer run; there are sun shirts with extra features like a stash pocket or a built-in gaiter; and there are options that come in more colors or patterns. But all told, this is a great all-around sun shirt from a brand that has proved its quality over and over again. Patagonia offers this style in men’s and women’s sizes. Best Sun Shirt For Hiking Log Those Miles Sans UV-Damage Cotopaxi Cotopaxi Sombra Sun Hoodie Materials: Polyester (pocket is poly/spandex blend) | Weight: 5.2 ounces | UPF rating: 50+ | Sizes: S - XXL Pros: Thumb loops help maximize coverage Zippered stash pocket Many size options Cons: Elbows wear out too quickly Cotopaxi makes some of the finest apparel and gear I’ve ever used, and all of it features a bit of style thrown in with the reliable performance. Here, the stylish bit comes in the form of contrasting colors. As for the performance? The Sombra Sun Hoodie has you covered with its UPF rating of 50+, its fabric blend of recycled polyester and stretchy nylon, and its thumb holes that help the sleeves stay in place. The shirt’s zippered stash pocket is perfect for holding a wallet, a snack or your keys. Soft, flexible, wicking and odor-reducing, this is a sun shirt you can wear all day on an epic thru-hike, then pull on again the next morning without an olfactory assault. It’s available in kid’s sizes, women’s sizes and men’s sizes (shown). One thing we have to note that’s not so positive is that several customers report the fabric at the elbows showed signs of wear sooner than they expected. If you really do relegate this sun shirt to use only while hiking, that should be a moot point unless you’re lucky enough to hike multiple times a week. However, if you use it for paddling, mowing the lawn or running, it may wear out quickly at that joint. Best Sun Shirt For Running Light And Cool And Ready To Move Columbia Columbia PFG Zero Rules Short Sleeve Shirt Materials: Polyester | Weight: 4.8 ounces | UPF rating: 50+ | Sizes: XS - XXL Pros: Great price Sweat-activated cooling Excellent sweat wicking Cons: Lower UPF rating than most sun shirts Sizes run large Yes, this shirt is from Columbia Sportswear’s PFG line, and PFG stands for Performance Fishing Gear. So why am I recommending it as a sun shirt for running? Because it turns out a shirt made for fishing is great for hot weather runs. I know because I own several PFG tees from Columbia and run in them all the time in the summer. Just as fishing can be hot, sweaty stuff, so too can those runs, so the superb sweat wicking of this light, flexible shirt is always welcome. Equally welcome, the shirt actually gets cooler as you sweat, thanks to Columbia’s Omni-Freeze Zero tech, even before evaporative cooling takes place. Omni-Freeze technology is basically a series of dark blue dots printed on the interior of the shirt that grow cooler when damp. Just be mindful of the fact that your forearms still need sunblock, and that at 30 UPF, this shirt provides less UV protection than others on our list. So if you’ll be wearing it for hours in direct sunshine, it’s a good idea to still apply sunblock all over. Best Sun Shirt For Fishing Paddle Out Or Reel 'Em In Free Fly Apparel Free Fly Elevate Hoodie Materials: 83% Polyester, 11% Lyocell, 6% spandex | Weight: 6.1 ounces | UPF rating: 30+ | Sizes: S - XXL Pros: Made from more than 80% recycled material Soft and flexible fabric Resists odor buildup Cons: Higher cost The Free Fly Elevate Hoodie is an angler’s dream shirt because it keeps you safer from sunburn, and drier whether it’s wicking away sweat or releasing moisture splashed your way from the bay, lake or river. It’s soft enough for all day wear, yet durable enough to last for many seasons. The fabric blend, which is more than 80% recycled polyester and a mix of breathable Lyocell and stretchy spandex, ensures you have full range of motion, which you’ll need as you cast and reel. This shirt’s quick drying and ease of flex also make it a fine choice to wear paddling, as you can stroke and steer your kayak, canoe or SUP with ease. You’ll worry less about sunburn thanks to a UPF 30-plus rating, and it’s also available in women’s sizes. All that good stuff does come with a price, though: this shirt costs almost $90, which is quite a bit higher than many other sun shirts on the market. But it’s a tested and trusted top that thrives when used in its intended environs: atop the water. Best Sun Shirt For Kids Big Sun Protection For Little Explorers Hanna Andersson Hanna Andersson Rash Guard Top Materials: 82% recycled nylon, 18% spandex | Weight: 5 ounces | UPF rating: 30+ | Sizes: 2 - 12 Pros: Good value Shirt blocks 97% of the sun’s ultraviolet light Soft fabric with flatlock seams Cons: Threading frays with heavy use and repeat washing Whenever we head to the pool, the beach or out onto the water in our kayaks, our kids are wearing rash guards, and about half the time they're wearing this one from Hanna Andersson. This shirt blocks out 97% of the sun’s UV rays, almost completely stopping any chance of sun damage to young, sensitive skin. It dries fast enough to almost completely stop those complaints after a swim or a splash, too. Colorful without being garish—and that’s true no matter which shade you pick—these rash guards don’t elicit any groans in terms of looks, and with their soft fabric and flat seams, the shirts are comfortable enough to prevent most protests, too. If you know Hanna Andersson primarily for the brand’s pajamas, sweatshirts and other apparel, you probably associate the clothing with the word “durable.” Hanna clothes are the ultimate hand-me-down, lasting through multiple kids with ease. At least...usually. While we have not experienced any issues with the Hanna Andersson swimwear our kids use, some customers report the threading at the hems, cuffs and neckline frays after a number of uses and washes. Best Dress With Sun Protection A Dress That Performs Best On Bright Days MOST POPULAR Line In The Sand Swim Line In The Sand Splash Around Sun & Swim Dress Materials: Nylon | Weight: 9 ounces | UPF rating: 50+ | Sizes: S - XXL Pros: Sun protection from neck to thigh Made from 100% recycled materials Profits from sales go to charity Cons: High cost Okay, so we have alluded to the fact that most sun shirts don’t look all that great, but who cares if they keep you cooler, drier and safe from UV damage? Well, this sun dress keeps you cooler, drier, safe from ultraviolet radiation, and it looks good, too. There are several colors and patterns to choose from, but what we love even more is that this dress is made from 100% recycled materials. It has a UPF 50-plus rating, so your neck, torso, arms and upper legs are protected from the sun. And it dries fast, so you won’t be damp (or sweaty) even after high-intensity activities. All that good stuff comes with a price, to be sure, but when you can have performance and style, that’s worth a little extra. Best Value Sun Shirt Amazon Roadbox Sun Protection Shirt Materials: Polyester | Weight: 5 ounces | UPF rating: 50+ | Sizes: S - XXXL Pros: Great price point Comes in lots of colors Soft and flexible Cons: Torso too long There’s nothing all that unique about the Roadbox Sun Protection Shirt and frankly, there’s nothing that really stands out about this garment, except for the fact that it costs less than $20. At that price point, you might expect a poorly-made and uncomfortable sun shirt, but what you’ll get is a soft, flexible and quite effective garment rated at UPF 50-plus that wicks sweat and cools you even as it blocks those UV rays. So that is rather remarkable, after all. This shirt comes in many different sizes and in many different color options, so you can find the one that will fit your body and your sense of style even as it easily fits your budget. Just note that the torso of this sun shirt runs long, so if you are on the shorter side, it’s a good idea to keep shopping. That, or just see the overly long shirt as added sun protection below the waist. MORE FROMFORBES VETTED The 13 Best Cookbooks Of Summer 2024 By Patty Lee Contributor Teva Aventrail Review: Can A Trail Running Sandal Go The Distance? By Cam Vigliotta Forbes Staff How We Chose The Best Sun Shirts I currently own six long sleeve sun shirts and at least 10 short sleeve shirts with UPF protection. Yes, it’s excessive, but let me tell you this: I have not gotten a sunburn on my shoulders or torso in years, and that’s despite the fact that I run or ride a bike four or five times a week during the summer and often spend the weekends in a kayak or canoe. I factored my own experience as a sun shirt user into this article, and as a dad concerned about the wellbeing of his kids—we are even more diligent about our kids wearing sun shirts in the summer than we are about ourselves. To be sure I wasn’t missing some good brands, I also reached out to experts in the apparel field for some recommendations and I did a lot of research on the best sun shirts based on things like materials, UPF rating and use case scenarios. And, of course, I combed through ratings and reviews posted by verified sun shirt buyers. What You Need To Know About Sun Shirts There are a few things you need to look for in any sun shirt worth your consideration, and perhaps a few new terms you’re going to encounter, too. First, the elephant in the room when it comes to sun protection: UPF. What Is UPF Protection? Most people are familiar with the term SPF, which is used to rate the efficacy of sunscreen. SPF stands for Sun Protection Factor, and the higher the number, the more protection a sunblock affords your skin. UPF, on the other hand, stands for Ultraviolet Protection Factor and it’s a rating system only applied to garments, according to The Skin Cancer Foundation. Again, the higher the UPF rating, the better: UPF 50, for example, blocks out all but a fiftieth of the sun’s UVA and UVB rays, which is to say it blocks 98% of the ultraviolet rays that damage your skin. The Skin Cancer Foundation recommends a minimum of UPF 30 for sun protective apparel. Fabrics There’s a time to go all-natural and there’s a time to go very much synthetic, and sun shirts falls very much into the latter category. With wool being a semi-exception, few natural fibers can be used to make a fabric with the quick-drying, moisture-wicking and sun blocking properties of fabrics made from artificial fibers. What’s more, materials like polypropylene, nylon and spandex offer excellent freedom of motion and flex, which y0u need when you’re swimming, paddling or hiking. You can by all means look for sun shirts with recycled materials used in the fabric blend, but natural materials won't cut it here. Caring For Your Sun Shirt You should take the time to read each garment’s label and follow its washing directions as specifically as you can, but as a general rule, sun shirts and rash guards can be machine washed on a gentle cycle with cool water and a mild detergent. It’s best to dry them laid flat on a towel or over a pair of lines. If you must, some brands can be dried on the lowest heat setting in the dryer, but know this will likely shorten their working life. Also, you really should wash your sun shirt after each use that involved any appreciable sweat or splashes, because keeping these garments cleaner helps them avoid being exposed to chemicals or bacteria that can break down the fiber slowly but steadily over time.

That list might include a beach canopy—and if it doesn’t, there are many reasons it should.

Once reserved for waterfront hotels and restaurants, a beach canopy for you and your family is readily available in all shapes, sizes, colors and structures. Relax at the beach with the shade and shelter with one of our picks for the best beach canopy.

Unlike beach canopies that require anchors and poles in certain positions, the Sun Ninja’s soft, stretchy fabric can support different configurations based on where the poles are placed. It also comes in three sizes (4-person, 6-person or 8-person) to provide shade and shelter for couples, families and large gatherings. The included travel bag makes it easy to set up the canopy no matter where your adventures take you. Best Value Beach Canopy Use It From The Beach To The Backcountry Kelty Kelty Noah's Tarp 12 Dimensions: 12 x 12 feet | Water resistant: Yes | UV resistant: UPF+50 Pros: Versatile design complements trips beyond the beach Taped seams seal out unwanted moisture Available in multiple sizes Cons: Staff poles sold separately Unlike traditional beach canopies that feature anchors at the corners, Kelty’s Noah’s Tarp uses a combination of poles and guylines to raise the perfect shaded environment. And because the canopy doesn’t require sand or rocks to anchor it down, the tarp can be used beyond the beach (think: local park or campground), which is why it receives such high marks for value. While the polyester material might feel thin and fragile, it’s taped at the seams and coated to keep water out, be it rain or beach spray. If your outdoor adventures include frequent trips to the beach, the Noah’s Tarp 12 provides the perfect amount of space for groups large and small, though different sizing options are available. No matter which model you choose, each one comes with a handy carrying case, but you’ll have to buy the poles separately. Best Splurge Beach Canopy A Worthy Upgrade For Your Next Sunny Getaway Amazon Shibumi Shade Classic Dimensions: 27.7 x 4.6 x 4.5 inches | Water resistant: Yes | UV resistant: UPF 50+ Pros: Offers shade for up to six people Quick and easy assembly in minutes Lightweight and portable at just 4 pounds Cons: Pricey in comparison to other canopies While the Shibumi Shade Classic may cost you more, it delivers on every front. Suitable for up to six people with 150 feet of shaded space, the roomy canopy is not only easy to set up (it comes with simple to follow instructions) but is lightweight for packing and hauling to and from the beach. Plus, it offers UPF 50+ sun protection against harmful rays. It also has a small environmental impact as it’s made from 40% ocean-bound recycled plastic bottles. The design is a little different from other canopies. Rooted down with two aluminum poles and a sand bag, the open-ended structure flies securely in the wind for constant cover. There’s also a mini option that drives down the cost and is ideal if you’re going to the beach solo or as a duo. Best Portable Beach Canopy A Packable Structure That Still Provides Plenty Of Shade Amazon Neso Portable Canopy Sunshade Dimensions: 7 x 7 feet | Water resistant: Yes | UV resistant: UPF 50+ Pros: Incredibly lightweight Water- and UV-resistant Available in a variety of colors Cons: Doesn’t protect from high winds Whether you’re traveling from one waterfront destination to the next or living out of your van, the compact, portable Neso sunshade easily fits in a backpack, beach bag or storage bin. It weighs a mere 4 pounds with the aluminum poles and features a high-quality blend of nylon and lycra to deliver lightweight durability. Like other beach canopies on this list, the design anchors to the ground via sandbags and expands at the corners, giving you the ability to shape the space to your liking. Beyond its obvious lack of weight, the canopy packs into a 19.5-inch carrying case, which just so happens to meet carry-on luggage specifications should you decide to bring it on a plane. It’s also available in 28 colors and patterns, including stand-out options that distinguish your beach setup from countless other vacationers. Best Windproof Beach Canopy A Sunshade To Outlast The Elements Amazon Buheco Beach Tent Pop Up Dimensions: 7 x 7.5 feet; 10 x 10 feet | Water Resistant: Yes | UV Resistant: UPF 50+ Pros: Water-repellent fabric Vents promote airflow Setup comes with stakes and accessories Cons: Design limits the number of occupants The Buheco Beach Tent Pop Up Shade, available in two sizes, is a stable choice for windy days at the beach. Held up by four windproof ropes, bend-proof aluminum poles and eight reinforced ground pegs, this canopy won’t budge in the breeze. The V-point design of the poles holds solid in the sand for extra support. Plus, the top of the poles are fitted with an EVA ball that won’t tear through the fabric. Four sandbags, at 14.6 inches each, give a higher than average filling capacity to weigh it down. And, at 10 x 10 feet, the larger of the two sizes fits a beach party of up to eight people, plus offers UPF 50+ sun coverage. Although there are four big sandbags to fill, the set up is simple enough—the follow along instructions will guide you in pitching and packing the canopy away in just minutes. Best Beach Canopy For Families Keep The Gang Out Of The Sun With This Portable Big-Top Amazon Osoeri Beach Tent Dimensions: 20 x 13 feet | Water resistant: Yes | UV resistant: UPF 50+ Pros: Extra space for up to 12 people Windproof Comes with a carry bag Cons: Multiple parts to set up If you're planning on bringing the entire family to the beach or prefer to throw a party in the sand, then the Osoeri Beach Tent should be at the top of your list. With space to comfortably shield between 10 to 12 people, you’ll be well-covered from the sun (it offers UPF 50+) and won’t risk losing your canopy to a gust of wind, either—eight sandbags and aluminum poles ensure that. The design also has a flexible setup arrangement that creates either a two-pole or three-pole structure for a more panoramic beachfront view. If you're taking the party elsewhere, the canopy works on virtually any terrain, including your backyard, public park or campsite. Once you're finished, a carry bag conveniently stores the kit away for improved portability. Best Budget Beach Canopy Affordable, Reliable Shade That Won’t Break The Bank Amazon WhiteFang Beach Sunshade Dimensions: 6.9 x 4.5 x 3.8 feet | Water resistant: No | UV resistant: UPF 50+ Pros: Easy to assemble Openings promote ventilation Floor mat extends outward or upright to meet your needs Cons: 360-degree ventilation doesn’t allow for water resistance Some users report difficulty setting it up for the first time While the WhiteFang beach canopy might not offer the same open-air design as more expensive models, it’s still a top pick thanks to its reliability and reasonable price point. It has a simple freestanding structure that’s free of anchors, and the coated polyester fabric blocks heat and 98% of harmful UV rays. The canopy’s fiberglass rods keep it stable through high winds and at 3 pounds, it’s easy to transport from the parking lot to the sand. Should you need extra space for occupants or activities, simply unzip the front floor to extend the real estate outwards beyond the canopy, or zip it up to create a little extra privacy. MORE FROMFORBES VETTED The Best Down Pillows That Offer Fluffy, Luxurious Comfort Every Night By Jessica Timmons Contributor The Best Sun Shirts To Protect Your Skin On Sunny Days By Steven John Contributor Why Trust Forbes Vetted As a team, Forbes Vetted editors have tried and tested a magnitude of gear spanning many categories—and beach essentials are no exception. When piecing this list together, we put thought into what our readers require from a canopy, from specific materials to styles and ease of construction. We also carefully reviewed each canopy that made the final cut to weigh its value based on features including sturdiness and protective elements, so you can enjoy a day of fun in the sand without worrying about a gust of wind toppling your canopy. How We Chose The Best Beach Canopies Our comprehensive list of best beach canopies features a variety of options plucked from the highest-rated reviews across multiple brands. When curating this roundup, we considered a number of important factors, including UV protection, size, wind- and water-proofing as well as value for your money. Our final list is based not only on these variables, but customer reviews that offer real-world feedback from beachgoers just like you. What To Consider When Shopping For A Beach Canopy Size And Weight Let’s say you’re heading to the beach on a romantic date or to catch up with friends. A small canopy that’s light and easy to carry will serve you perfectly, especially if you have other beach essentials packed. On the other hand, if you’re a part of a larger group that requires more shade, a canopy that offers real estate for multiple people is a better fit. Keep in mind that larger canopies will be heavier than a smaller ones, but most canopies fold compactly away and are designed to be carried from one destination to the next. Portability Along the same thread, check if your chosen beach canopy has a carry case or folds down small enough to tuck into your beach wagon and suitcase if you’re traveling. This is especially important if a canopy comes with multiple bits and pieces as you’ll want to keep them all safely stored in one place. UV-Protection According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shade is one way to reduce sun damage risk, along with sunscreen and protective clothing. For the most effective shelter, opt for a canopy that offers ultraviolet protection from harmful rays with a UPF rating of 50+. Stability And Wind Resistance Beaches are often windy, so it's important to choose a canopy that can withstand gusts and stay stable. Look for canopies with sturdy frames, reinforced corners and ground stakes or sandbags to secure it to the ground. Ventilation features like mesh windows can also help reduce wind resistance. Ventilation And Airflow Beach canopies can get hot and stuffy, so it's essential to choose one that offers good ventilation. Look for canopies with mesh panels or windows that allow for airflow, preventing the interior from becoming too hot or stagnant. Price And Budget This one may seem obvious, but you should set a budget for your beach canopy investment and compare prices across different brands and models. While it's important to consider the cost, also prioritize quality, durability and features that meet your specific needs, as these determine whether or not one model is a good value compared to the next. What Canopy Is Best For The Beach? The best beach canopy depends on your budget, size requirements and other needed features—including its ability to adequately protect you from the sun. For example, how many of you are heading to the beach? If it’s a solo or duo venture, perhaps the budget WhiteFang Beach Sunshade will fit the bill. However, if you're looking for something for the entire family, an option like the Osoeri Beach Tent that can fit up to 12 may better meet your needs. Ultimately, you’ll want to purchase a beach canopy with a convenient transport solution, like a carry case that's easy to tow around. How Is A Beach Canopy Different To A Beach Umbrella? Although a beach canopy and beach umbrella provide shade and respite from sun rays, the similarities stop there. While an umbrella is rooted into the sand via one stand and can cover perhaps two people at a time, a canopy offers ample space to house the whole family or a group of friends. It’s also fixed in to the sand via multiple contact points. Arguably it’s more stable as a result. However, it will take longer to “pitch” than an umbrella but that’s a small price to pay for hours of relaxation. Does a Beach Canopy Protect You From The Sun? A good beach canopy will give ample, shady protection from harmful UV rays. Many are made from strong or multi-layer fabric that reflects the sun away. Keep in mind, as the sides of a canopy are open, which is ideal for airflow, it means UV protection is not 100% guaranteed. Even in the shade, the sun can reflect off the sand or poke through exposed areas around the canopy. Make sure to slather on the sunscreen and bring suitable clothing and a hat too.",

                    "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin If you’re a lightweight sleeper under 150 pounds, you may find that the average mattress feels stiff and unforgiving. The best mattress for lightweight sleepers tends to be on the medium to soft end of the firmness spectrum but doesn’t skimp on proper support. Our top choice is the Puffy Lux Hybrid because of its luxuriously soft and fluffy profile, pressure-relieving feel and sturdy construction that helps reinforce the spine. With that said, we name seven other beds to consider below if you’d prefer to go a different route. We named the Puffy Lux the best mattress for lightweight sleepers because of its extra-plush and ... [+] comfortable feel that doesn't lack support. Puffy Your body type plays a role in the way you perceive a mattress. Generally, the less you weigh, the firmer a mattress feels. This helps explain why medium or medium-firm beds can feel much firmer for those with smaller frames. Our list of the best mattresses for lightweight sleepers includes plush and supportive options that satisfy different needs, from the best pick for hot sleepers to a top-rated hotel-quality choice. Best Mattress For Lightweight Sleepers Overall: Puffy Lux Hybrid Mattress (Queen) Best Affordable Mattress For Lightweight Sleepers: Cocoon Chill Mattress (Queen) Best Mattress For Lightweight Side Sleepers: Helix Sunset Mattress (Queen) Best Hotel Mattress For Lightweight Sleepers: WinkBed Luxury Hybrid Mattress (Queen) Best Mattress For Lightweight Teens: Brooklyn Bedding Essential Mattress (Queen) Best Mattress For Lightweight Stomach Sleepers: Saatva Classic Mattress (Queen) Best Mattress For Lightweight Couples: Nolah Original 10\" Mattress (Queen) Best Mattress For Lightweight Sleepers Overall Comfortable And Luxurious For A Variety Of Sleeper Types Puffy Puffy Lux Hybrid Mattress (Queen) Type: Hybrid | Firmness: Medium-plush | Delivery: Free | Trial: 101 nights | Warranty: Lifetime Pros: Helps regulate temperature with multiple cooling layers Hybrid construction helps reinforce the spine Medium plush profile accommodates lightweight side, back and combo sleepers Cons: A little too soft for lightweight stomach sleepers Lightweight sleepers, especially those who sleep on their side, need a plush mattress that maintains alignment and prevents the feeling of pins and needles in your arm. The Puffy Lux Hybrid is stacked with eight layers and made from responsive pocketed coils, soft foams and a comfy quilted top that cradle your curves and promote proper back support. It also contains gel-foam that absorbs body heat, a layer Puffy named Climate Fiber that enhances airflow and an airy, quilted top woven with cooling fibers. Together, these layers help regulate temperature and leave you feeling more comfortable through the night. While it’s rated a medium-plush, most lightweight sleepers should think it falls around a medium, making it comfortable for back, side and combination sleepers. What the reviews say: “After over a month with the new mattress, all of the back pain I used to wake up with is gone. My wife and I are both very happy with our purchase and while we tend to have different preferences of firmness, this mattress suits both of our needs nicely,” says one customer. Another raves, “[It’s] a really great mattress for those looking for soft luxury. You really do feel the difference when you sleep on it.” Best Affordable Mattress For Lightweight Sleepers Supportive, Cooling And Comes At A Good Value Cocoon Cocoon Chill Mattress (Queen) Type: Foam | Firmness: Medium-firm | Delivery: Free | Trial: 120 nights | Warranty: Lifetime Pros: Comes with a cooling cover with phase-change material Provides ideal support for lightweight stomach and back sleepers Cons: Too firm for many side and combination sleepers If you’re unfamiliar with the Cocoon Chill Mattress, you may know Sealy, its parent company and long-time veteran in the mattress industry. Backed by a reputable brand, this ultra-affordable memory foam mattress comes with added features that are most common among beds that cost $1,000 or more. Its main bread and butter is a cool-to-the-touch cover infused with phase-change materials that draw body heat away to help keep you at a more comfortable temperature. Traditional memory foam beds are known for their heat retention, but the Cocoon Chill is built to curb that reputation. Below the cover are three layers of foam, and each serves its own purpose to provide a comfortable and supportive surface for lightweight stomach and back sleepers. Its firmer surface is a little too hard for side sleepers under 150 pounds. What the reviews say: According to one customer, “[We] bought this mattress for our grandson, he's always complaining about being hot. [And it’s] just the right firmness, he loves it.” Another claims they bought the Cocoon Chill for their 70-year-old mother and says, “Each time I ask her how [she] likes it, the answer is yes, very much.” Best Mattress For Lightweight Side Sleepers An Ultra Plush And Pressure-Relieving Choice Helix Helix Sunset Mattress (Queen) Type: Hybrid | Firmness: Plush | Delivery: Free | Trial: 100 nights | Warranty: 10 years Pros: Designed with pressure relief for side sleepers Affordable pricing Upgrade option for cooling cover Cons: Not ideal for back or stomach sleepers The Helix Sunset mattress is designed with pressure relief in mind and is perfectly accommodating for side sleepers. The Helix Sunset is an especially plush hybrid, constructed with pocketed coils, memory foam and other cushy foam layers that help relieve pressure and support the joints and spine. If you weigh under 150 pounds, you may pin its profile around a medium-plush or medium, which offers a good balance between soft and supportive. You have the choice between a standard knit cover or a specialty GlacioTex pillow top. It adds an extra layer of soft cushion and features cooling fibers that help maintain lower temperatures and promote more comfortable sleep. If you’re a side sleeper who tends to sleep hot, this upgrade may be worth it. What the reviews say: One side sleeper claims, “I [have] lower back and neck problems. I absolutely love this mattress. I need a softer mattress so my shoulder doesn't get jammed in on the side I sleep on, and the Helix [Sunset] Mattress does a great job of cradling me without creating a pressure point. I added the pillow top to make it even more comfortable.” Best Hotel Mattress For Lightweight Sleepers A High-Quality Hybrid With A High-End Feel WinkBed WinkBed Luxury Hybrid Mattress (Queen) Type: Hybrid | Firmness: Softer, luxury firm and firmer | Delivery: Free | Trial: 120 nights | Warranty: Lifetime Pros: Three firmness level options Euro pillow top adds plush cushion Zoned coils provide targeted relief and support Cons: Might be too firm for some lightweight side sleepers Have you ever gone on vacation and favored the hotel mattress way more than yours back home? The WinkBed Mattress holds its own against high-end mattresses, like the ones found in The Four Seasons or Fairmont Hotel. It’s stacked with premium materials starting from the ground up, from the zoned pocketed coil layers that are firmer under the back and edges for increased support and less dense under your hips and shoulders. It has multiple comfort layers that provide a comfortable, responsive surface that doesn’t make you dip or sink into the bed. Finally, its gel-infused Euro pillow top gives it an extra-plush look and feel that finishes its hotel-like aesthetic. Most lightweight sleepers should opt for the softer model, which may actually feel like a medium to medium-firm. As a result, prominent side sleepers under 150 pounds may want to consider a softer option. What the reviews say: One person raves, “This mattress is one of the best I’ve ever slept on. I immediately felt a difference from my aging memory foam mattress that had me waking up feeling injured every morning. The wink mattress feels high-quality and healthy for my body. The only downside is, sometimes I don’t want to get out of bed.” Best Mattress For Lightweight Teens Enjoy An Affordable Hybrid With A Comfortable Profile Brooklyn Bedding Brooklyn Bedding Essential Mattress (Queen) Type: Hybrid | Firmness: Medium | Delivery: Free | Trial: 120 nights | Warranty: 10 years Pros: Offers a good value Optimal for back, stomach and combination sleepers Cons: Too firm for side sleepers Teens can be picky and might grow out of their mattress several years after buying one. That’s why we recommend the Brooklyn Bedding Essential Mattress—it’s a safe pick for back, stomach and combination sleepers because it boasts a medium firmness, which feels more like a medium-firm for people under the 150-pound threshold. The eight inches of individually wrapped coils provide optimal support for spinal alignment while the foams keep you comfortable without giving you a “sink-in” feel. It also comes at a great value, as it’s difficult to find a quality hybrid mattress that beats this price tag. It’s not loaded with added features, but that’s the beauty of it—as the brand says, some people just want a simple, comfortable mattress. What the reviews say: One shopper says the “box was in perfect condition, and the mattress, well—that was more than perfect. My son loves it.” Best Mattress For Lightweight Stomach Sleepers An Luxurious Model Suitable For Stomach Sleepers Saatva Saatva Classic Mattress (Queen) Type: Hybrid | Firmness: Plush, luxury firm and firm | Delivery: Free white glove delivery | Trial: 365 nights | Warranty: Lifetime Pros: Multiple firmness and height options are available Free mattress set-up and removal of your old mattress Dual-coil design offers enhanced support Cons: The return fee is $99 if you dislike the bed Stomach sleepers require a good balance of pressure relief and support to maintain spinal alignment. Mattresses that are too soft can cause the hips to dip downward. The plush model of the Saatva Classic offers a good balance, being soft enough for most lightweight sleepers but supportive enough for those who mainly sleep on their stomach. Unlike most hybrid mattresses on the market, this features two layers of steel coils; one pocketed coil layer and a micro-coil layer for additional reinforcements. This makes it especially durable and supportive. Saatva is also the only mattress brand on our list that offers free white glove delivery, which is an especially nice perk if you have an old mattress or frame you want to ditch, as Saatva takes care of the hard work for you. What the reviews say: One person says, “I bought theSaatva Mattress because I read so many good reviews. I know it’s a little pricey but it is worth the money. Now the only problem is my daughters want to sleep on my bed. They love my Saatva mattress and said it is so comfortable. I think it is worth trying.” Another sleeper who purchased the Saatva Classic says, “We find the mattress extremely comfortable. My wife is actually able to sleep on her stomach once again. [It was a] good purchase for us.” Best Mattress For Lightweight Couples Enjoy A Soft Profile With A Balanced Feel Nolah Nolah Original 10\" Mattress (Queen) Type: Memory foam | Firmness: Medium | Delivery: Free | Trial: 120 nights | Warranty: Lifetime Pros Medium profile accommodates back, stomach and combination sleepers best Zoned support layer for increased relief under the hips and shoulders Longer warranty than most foam mattresses Cons Might be a little too firm for strict side sleepers The Nolah Mattress is a comfortable foam mattress with a balanced profile that suits most couples, even if you have different sleeping positions. Inside, there’s a layer of proprietary AirFoam that contains millions of air bubbles for better breathability and increased airflow. The brand says the mattress disperses heat 20% faster than a regular memory foam bed, which is helpful for couples since co-sleeping can lead to higher temperatures under the covers. The AirFoam also has a zoned design for increased pressure relief under the hips and shoulders. It also does a great job of absorbing movement from your partner, which leads to fewer disturbances during the night. Lightweight individuals may think this bed feels more like a medium to medium-firm, so it’s ideal for most sleepers, except strict side sleepers under 150 pounds. In that case, you may want an even softer bed. What the reviews say: One satisfied couple says, “We bought our king size online [and it] arrived quickly. Best sleep we’ve had in ages. When my husband moves I can’t even feel it. It’s perfect [and I] would definitely recommend it.” Another happy pair says, “The Nolah Original 10 is great. My husband and I are sleeping so much better and are very comfortable sleeping on our new mattress. Even with our individual health issues, we are very happy with our purchase.” MORE FROMFORBES VETTED Upgrade Your Day At The Beach With The Best Beach Canopy Of 2024 By Cam Vigliotta Forbes Staff The Most Popular Products In May, According To Forbes Vetted Readers By Whitney Bruno Forbes Staff What To Look For In The Best Mattress For Lightweight Sleepers Lightweight sleepers should consider a few key features when looking for the best mattress for their needs. Firmness Since lightweight sleepers exert less pressure on the bed, they don’t sink as far into the layers as an average-weighted to heavy individual. Due to this, many lightweight sleepers find that beds feel much firmer, which can cause shoulder, hip and/or back pain. For example, a medium-firm mattress may feel quite firm to a lightweight sleeper—but perfectly comfortable to an average weight or heavy sleeper. Most lightweight sleepers prefer a medium or soft mattress. Sleeping Position Your sleeping position helps determine which points on your body have the most pressure on them, and the goal is to find a mattress that maintains spinal alignment. Your body needs the right amount of sinkage, pressure relief, and support. Side sleepers often need pressure relief at the shoulders and hips, while stomach and back sleepers need firm back support. Materials The best materials for a lightweight sleeper depend on individual preference. The materials of a mattress affect how it feels, such as how cool it stays or how bouncy it is. Memory Foam: Memory foam mattresses often have a slow-moving, marshmallowy feel which can feel comfortable for some lightweight sleepers. It should be noted, however, that memory foam can trap heat if it doesn’t have added cooling materials. Latex Foam: Latex foam is typically durable, responsive and more eco-friendly than memory or polyurethane foam. Latex foam mattresses are a great option for lightweight sleepers looking for a durable, sustainably-sourced mattress with some bounce. Polyurethane Foam: Polyurethane foam is a lower quality, lower cost foam that can be great for budget shoppers. It is commonly used in mattresses and couch cushions for its responsiveness and comfort, and different densities are available. Hybrid: Hybrid mattresses offers more support and airflow than all-foam beds because they’re made with a steel coil layer at the base. However, hybrid mattresses are often more expensive than their foam counterparts. Construction Mattresses typically fall in the all-foam or hybrid category. All-foam mattresses contain a dense support layer at the bottom and one or more comfort layers for added cushion. Hybrid beds combine steel coils, reminiscent of an innerspring bed, with comfort foam layers for the best of both worlds. People under 150 pounds will do just fine on an all-foam mattress, but can choose a hybrid construction for more support—just as long as it’s not too firm. Do Lighter People Need Softer Mattresses? Mattresses can feel firmer for a lightweight person, since they exert less pressure into a bed. The best mattresses for lightweight sleepers tend to be on the medium to soft side, depending on their preferred sleeping position. What Is The Best Mattress For Light Sleepers? The best mattress for lightweight sleepers depends on their individual needs and preferences, but are typically on the softer side. Petite sleepers won’t sink into a mattress as much as heavier people, so they need a softer mattress. What Is A Lightweight Sleeper? Lightweight sleepers are typically 150 pounds or less in body weight. A person’s body weight can change how much they sink into the mattress layers, affecting the support, pressure-relief and overall feel of the mattress for that person.

Today’s best futons are well constructed, with contemporary designs that can fit seamlessly into any living space. Our top pick overall is the Jannick Full Futon Sleeper from West Elm, a gorgeous Scandinavian-inspired sofa that folds down into a full-sized bed. We also like the Apt2B’s Haden Urban Sofa Bed’s versatile armless silhouette, two-person sleeper and under $700 price tag—perfect for those shopping for smaller homes or on a particular budget. The best futons—which include Apt2B's Haden, pictured—are well-constructed and small-space friendly.

Best Futon Overall: West Elm Jannick Full Futon Sleeper Best Value Futon: Serta Linen Tufted Back Convertible Sofa Most Comfortable Futon: Apt2B Haden Urban Sofa Bed Best Leather Futon: West Elm Andes Full Leather Futon Best Futon Chair: Latitude Run Jazariah Convertible Chair Best Large Futon: Pottery Barn Shasta Roll Arm Upholstered Storage Futon Best Modern Futon: Novograts Skylar Coil Futon Modern Sofa Bed And Couch Best Kid-Friendly Futon: Pottery Barn Kids Anywhere Sofa Lounger Best Futon For Small Spaces: Corrigan Studio Convertible Faux Leather Futon Best Japanese Futon: Fuli Japanese Futon Mattress Best Futon Overall Scandinavian-Inspired And Sturdily Constructed West Elm West Elm Jannick Full Futon Sleeper Sofa dimensions: 85 x 39.8 x 47 inches | Sleeper dimensions: 85 x 53 x 22 inches | Fabric: Bouclé | Color options: 1 total, including Alabaster Pros: Versatile look Sturdy oak and metal frame Folds easily Cons: Currently only one color available With its Scandinavian design and gorgeous oak frame, West Elm’s Jannick futon could easily pass for your standard—and very chic—couch. It’s sturdily constructed, with an inner metal frame that can support up to 600 pounds. The futon also features soft bouclé fabric and supportive seat and back cushions (note: West Elm classifies the seat as medium-firm). You can easily convert the futon into a full-sized, two-person sleeper by pulling out the seat and pushing the back down; the inner coil mattress is fiber- and foam-filled to help balance support and comfort. Best Value Futon A Chic, Firm Space-Saver That's Less Than $200 Wayfair Serta Linen Tufted Back Convertible Sofa Sofa dimensions: 66.1 x 19.8 x 15 inches | Sleeper dimensions: 66.1 x 37.6 x 15 inches | Fabric: Linen | Color options: 5 total, including Charcoal and Light Gray Pros: A good value for those on a budget Modern, versatile design Offers several reclining positions Cons: May be too firm for some Ranging between $144 and $196 at Wayfair (depending on the color), this low-profile futon with mid-century elements is a great value futon designed to hold up to plenty of use. Supported by a solid hardwood frame, the futon features high-density foam cushioning for additional support; meanwhile, its metal legs add an extra stylish touch to the look. The sofa offers several recline options: an upright position, a 30-degree “lounger” setting and a fully flat position for sleeping. Reviewers like this futon’s easy setup (which involves simply attaching the legs and positioning the sofa upright), versatile aesthetic and relatively dirt-resistant fabric. Other reviewers say that it’s a bit too firm to use frequently as a sleeper, but those who prefer firm mattresses will find it comfortable. Most Comfortable Futon Modern And Equally Comfy As A Sleeper And A Seat MOST POPULAR Apt2B Apt2B Haden Urban Sofa Bed Sofa dimensions: 74.5 x 37 x 36 inches | Sleeper dimensions: 74.5 x 45 x 18 inches | Fabric: Polyester | Color options: 3 total, including Harbor Blue and Cappuccino Pros: Versatile design Removable legs Comfortable padding Cons: Sleeper is slightly smaller than full-sized The Hayden Urban Sofa Bed features high-density foam cushions that provide impressive comfort and support, whether they’re in seating or sleep mode. Removable legs allow you to adjust the height to get that just-right feel. To convert from couch to sleeper, simply drop down the back; it folds flat into a cushiony sleep surface. The armless silhouette and relatively lighter weight (just over 100 pounds) also makes it easy to place this futon just about anywhere. Users highlight this futon’s polyester upholstery for being soft and easy to wipe clean; a few also say it’s equally comfortable both as a sofa and a bed. Best Leather Futon Looks Like A Regular Leather Sofa And Is Easy To Unfold West Elm West Elm Andes Full Leather Futon Sofa dimensions: 83.5 x 40 x 31 inches | Sleeper dimensions: 83.5 x 40 x 31 inches | Fabric: Leather, vegan leather | Color options: 15 total, including Molasses and Navy Pros: Easy mechanism for folding and unfolding Large leather and vegan leather upholstery selection Sturdy feel Sizable sleeping space (unfolds to a queen) Cons: The priciest on this list The Andes looks so much like a regular leather couch that your guests might not believe you when you tell them it’s a futon. This sleek-shaped sofa is swathed in buttery soft leather, while the frame is crafted from sturdy, sustainably sourced wood and cast-metal legs—making for a futon that’s made to last. The best part is that it unfolds into a medium-firm, queen-sized sleeper, which easily folds back up again using a simple click-clack mechanism. And if real leather isn’t your thing, this futon is also available in vegan upholstery. Best Futon Chair An Accent Chair That Turns Into A Twin Bed Or Chaise Wayfair Latitude Run Jazariah Convertible Chair Sofa dimensions: 32.3 x 40.6 x 37 inches | Sleeper dimensions: 74.8 x 40.6 x 10.6 inches | Fabric: Polyester | Color options: 4 total, including Moon Light and Charcoal Pros: Ideal for tight spaces Simple, retro look Very easy to set up Comes with matching pillow Cons: Some users say its more comfy as a chair than as a bed Firm sleeper may require a mattress topper At a little over 40 inches wide, the Jazariah futon chair is petite, making it perfect for smaller spaces. That said, this futon chair is still roomy enough to serve as spare seating and a sleeper for one. (Or, you could buy two and push them together when needed, as one user did.) With its thick, supportive foam cushioning, armless design, and angled solid birchwood legs, this futon chair is decidedly simple yet modern. And according to several reviewers, you don’t have to worry about it falling apart after a few uses, thanks to its durable pine wood frame. Best Large Futon A Roomy Sofa With Built-In Storage Underneath Pottery Barn Pottery Barn Shasta Roll Arm Upholstered Storage Futon Sofa dimensions: 91 x 37 x 34 inches | Sleeper dimensions: 86.5 w x 45.5 x 34 inches | Fabric: Bouclé, chenille, tweed and more | Color options: 23 total, including Alabaster and Oatmeal Pros: Very spacious Versatile minimal design Hidden built-in storage Highly customizable Cons: Large footprint won’t work for smaller homes Enjoy ample lounging and sleeping room with the Shasta Roll Arm futon. Coming in at an impressive 91 inches wide, this futon provides enough space for two adults to snooze in comfort. And if you need to move it through a narrow doorway, don’t fret—it has removable wooden legs, which you can take off permanently if you prefer a low-to-the-ground look. On top of all that, it features a storage section underneath the futon to house your bed sheets and other essentials. Choose from among nearly 30 available fabric options. Best Modern Futon A Velvet Couch With Gold Legs And Three Reclining Options Target Novograts Skylar Coil Futon Modern Sofa Bed And Couch Sofa dimensions: 77 x 33 x 33.5 inches | Sleeper dimensions: 70 x 44 x 17.5 inches | Fabric: Velvet | Color options: 3 total, including Green and Ivory Pros: Modern design Three reclining positions Plush velvet fabric Can hold up to 600 pounds Cons: Users say color doesn’t exactly match photos The Novogratz futon is a gorgeous statement piece, thanks to its bold color options and velvet upholstery. Featuring a ribbed and tufted back with vertical stitching and gold powder-coated legs, this futon has serious (but fun) flair that’ll blend well with modern living spaces. A split-back design lets you and the person next to you choose between three reclining positions: sitting, lounging or sleeping. When you’re ready to sleep, simply fold it all the way down. Just note that you may need a mattress topper for this if you plan to use it frequently for sleeping. Best Kid-Friendly Futon Monogrammable, With A Machine-Washable Cover Pottery Barn Kids Pottery Barn Kids Anywhere Sofa Lounger Sofa dimensions: 39 x 23 x 23.5 inches | Sleeper dimensions: 39 x 52 x 3.5 inches | Fabric: Polyester sherpa | Color options: Cream Pros: Easy to unfold Option to add name or monogram Machine-washable cover Greenguard Gold Certified Cons: Only comes in one color The Anywhere Sofa Lounger is more like an oversized loveseat than a couch, but it has plenty of room to seat an elementary-aged child or two. Covered in plush sherpa fabric, the futon easily folds out into a sleeper bed as needed for naps and sleepovers. It’s also Greenguard Gold Certified, so you can feel good about your little one regularly lounging on it. The cover is machine washable and zips off in case of spills; there’s also a handle in case you want to tote it from room to room. Worth noting: Pottery Barn Kids gives you the option to add a name or initials to your sofa, if you so choose. Best Futon For Small Spaces An Attractive, Versatile Faux-Leather Option Wayfair Corrigan Studio Convertible Faux Leather Futon Sofa dimensions: 71 x 33 x 31.5 inches | Sleeper dimensions: 71 x 42 inches | Fabric: Faux leather (polyurethane) or line fabric (for Grey) | Color options: 3 total, including Brown and Black Pros: Adjustable armrests can lie down fully flat CertiPUR-US Certified Holds up to 600 pounds Split-back design makes it versatile Cons: Only comes in one color Corrigan Studio’s faux leather futon checks off several boxes that make it a worthwhile choice for small living spaces: It looks contemporary, its design is functional and versatile, and it has a reasonably sized footprint, even while converting to a generous twin-sized bed. (At 71 inches wide, it’s only slightly wider than our best value pick and has notably deeper seats.) Where this modern futon really stands out is in its adjustability. Its back has three different levels, and its armrests have four (including totally flat). Plus, the split-back design means this piece can function as a sofa (with or without armrests), a chaise, a recliner and, of course, a bed. Best Japanese Futon A Portable Floor Bed Perfect For Back Sleepers Amazon Fuli Japanese Futon Mattress Sofa dimensions: N/A | Sleeper dimensions: Varies, 75 x 55 x 2 inches (full) | Fabric: 100% cotton | Color options: White Pros: Easy to fold up and store Ideal for those with back or joint pain Breathable and made with 100% cotton Can be used on a bedframe Cons: Only comes in one color May be uncomfortable for side or stomach sleepers As its name implies, Japanese futons, like this one by Fuli, are essentially floor mattresses traditionally used by the Japanese for sleeping. While they may not offer a couch function like traditional futons do, Japanese futons are still space savers: They’re meant to be rolled up and stowed away when not in use. Fuli’s Japanese Futon is one of the highest rated and best reviewed of its kind. Made from 100% cotton, this foldable mattress comes in six sizes, from twin to king, including XL versions. While it folds up compactly, that doesn’t mean it skimps on support; several back-sleeping users say the three-layer Fuli provides them with ample comfort while distributing pressure evenly on their back. To make the mattress feel thicker, some reviewers suggest adding an authentic tatami underneath, something the Japanese also traditionally do. MORE FROMFORBES VETTED The Best Mattress For Lightweight Sleepers Promotes Plusher Comfort By Nicole M. LaMarco Contributor Upgrade Your Day At The Beach With The Best Beach Canopy Of 2024 By Cam Vigliotta Forbes Staff Why Trust Forbes Vetted The Forbes Vetted team used a combination of extensive research, subject matter expertise on home furnishings, and our personal experience to choose the best futons on the market. This story’s original author, Korin Miller, has reported extensively on couches and chairs, including sleeper sofas, recliners, Chesterfield sofas and leather couches. Senior home and kitchen editor Amanda Arnold, who oversaw the editing of this piece, has several years of experience covering the home furniture space. Our team consistently reviews this story to confirm our picks are still in stock and meet our selection criteria. It was last updated in June 2024 by writer Fran Sales, who added two more recommendations: a futon designed for small spaces and a Japanese futon. How We Chose The Best Futons To find the best futons for each category, we considered several key factors: fabric and color options, seating/sleeping capacity, aesthetic, functionality, and of course, price. We started our search by identifying the most popular brands and retailers on the market based on our staff’s extensive coverage of the home furniture space. We scoured dozens of verified customer reviews regarding the top-rated, best-selling futons on the market to determine which ones people love the most. We made sure each futon we recommend above has an average rating of at least 4 stars at a reputable online retailer. We drilled down on each product’s highlighted features to determine whether they worked or didn’t work for a wide range of users. What To Look For In The Best Futons Finding the right futon for you will depend on your particular needs and living space. Consider the following key features before investing in a convertible sofa: Size Unlike a traditional couch, evaluating the size of a futon means taking not just its overall dimensions into account, but also its seating and sleeping capacity. Measure a futon’s seating dimensions as you would a regular sofa, but pay particular attention to the seat’s depth, especially when considering how—and how often—you’ll be spending time on your futon in its couch formation. According to Eva Higby, an interior designer we previously spoke with for our roundup of the best couches, “If my clients love to lounge or cuddle up on a sofa, I look for an overall depth of 42 to 43 inches.” Keep in mind the average overall depth of a sofa is 40 inches. You’ll also want to thoroughly consider a futon’s sleeper dimensions. Most retailers also list these in mattress-sizing terms (e.g., twin XL, queen, full) to make it easier for shoppers to discern this information. (Check out our in-depth guide to mattress sizes for more details.) However, we still recommend double-checking the dimensions of a sleeper in inches, as some retailers will only list how many people a futon fits (for example, a “two-sleeper”) or classify it as a full or queen when it may actually be a couple inches shy of a true full-size mattress. Comfort Determining a futon’s comfort level is similar to how you would do so with a sofa and a mattress. Short of physically trying out a futon yourself, you can also look at the upholstery and fill. For some individuals, upholstery matters less than whether its cushioning feels supportive and plush; others prefer a particular fabric, like leather, velvet or—as is the case with the pricier options on this list—more upscale options, such as textured bouclé, chenille, performance fabrics (helpful for pet owners) and more. When it comes to judging a futon’s comfort once converted to a sleeper, consider how often you’ll be using it, whether for a quick nap or to have overnight guests sleep on. Real mattresses will almost always be more comfortable than a futon, but you can get a sense of how firm a futon is (and how close it is to your preferred comfort level) by checking the fill material. Folks who like firmer support will likely be happier with foam, shredded foam or spring coils surrounded by foam. Those who like more cushioning should opt for down or synthetic fiber fill. Style Fortunately, there is a wide range of futon styles out there, outside of the plain ones you may have often slept on in your undergraduate years. That means you’re likely to find one that fits your particular aesthetic or existing decor. You can find a good sampling on our list, including the Scandinavian-inspired West Elm Jannick, the modern armless Apt2B Haden, the sleek faux leather West Elm Andes and the highly versatile Corrigan Studio Convertible. Which Brand Of Futon Is Best? These days, many top furniture brands are in the futon game, offering cushioned, stylish options. We like the West Elm Jannick Full Futon Sleeper for its sleek style and ease of use, but brands like Serta, Pottery Barn, Apt2B and more also have great options. If you already have seating from a brand you love, it’s worth considering its futons. But know that you can get a quality product from a range of companies. Is There Such A Thing As A Comfortable Futon? Let’s be honest: There are tons of futons on the market, many of which are creaky and uncomfortable. That said, you don’t have to settle for a subpar futon if you don’t want to; consider Apt2B’s Haden Urban Sofa Bed, our favorite comfortable choice due to its supportive, high-density foam fill and plush upholstery. Also, there are easy ways to increase the comfort level of your futon. For example, you can provide extra padding by adding a mattress topper. Can You Use A Futon As A Couch? Absolutely—when a futon isn’t pulled out into a bed, it functions as a couch. They also come in a wide range of designs, sizes and fabrics, making it easy for you to find one that matches your overall aesthetic. But again, remember that most futons aren’t as plush as your standard couch or sectional sofa; the better the quality, though, the higher the comfort.",

Best Maternity Dresses For Wedding Guests Seraphine: The Chicest Bump-Friendly Formal Wear Seraphine Seraphine Flutter Sleeve Maxi Wrap Maternity Dress Material: Modal | Size range: 2 to 16 | Nursing friendly: Yes There’s a reason Catherine, princess of Wales and countess of Chester, was partial to Seraphine dresses and gowns during her pregnancies.

It’s bold, beautiful and includes nursing access and a flowy fit to accommodate bumps of all sizes.

Both the midi tank dress featured above and the brand’s shirt dress are silky soft, sustainable, size inclusive and easy to wear. I love this dress specifically because, as a bustier person, it can be hard to find a tank dress that feels modest enough to rock for preschool pickup but still flattering enough for date night.

The brand really knows how to nail elevated basics. It’s also sustainably crafted, female founded and ethically made in Europe. This dress is so sultry, elegant and comfortable, and has become a go-to that we can certainly envision wearing postpartum. We also really love that this specific off-the-shoulder style isn’t typically seen in maternity dresses. Norma Kamali: Colors, Styles And Flattering Silhouettes Abound Revolve Norma Kamali Diana Dress Material: Polyester, spandex | Size range: XXS to XL | Nursing friendly: Some styles, yes Norma Kamali isn’t technically a pregnancy brand, but the four-way stretch fabric and figure-hugging styles are beautifully suited to this chapter of life.

It often has sales, so it’s a fairly wallet-friendly choice for nicer looking pieces. What our writers say: “I love that the fabrics tend to be lightweight and breathable, making the dresses optimal for warmer months and climates,” says Goodman. “I’ve worn several Pink Blush options while pregnant and felt confident in each dress.” Tea: Matching Mommy And Me Options Tea Tea Smocked Dress Material: Cotton madras | Size range: XS to XL | Nursing friendly: Yes Tea’s dresses are bright, colorful and made from high-quality and soft fabrics, but we also love that they have matching baby and toddler outfits that use the same prints as their dresses. If you want to put togehter together family looks, we recommend considering something from Tea’s collection. We also like that 10% of Tea’s profits go to various philanthropic efforts worldwide, like the Global Fund for Children, Homeless Prenatal Project and Little Sister Fund.

We’ve shared the top places to shop for maternity clothing, as well as our favorites across various categories, including the best maternity work pants. The authors of this article, Lex Goodman and Elizabeth Mitchell Kadar, are seasoned shopping writers with a focus on fashion and parenting. They’re both moms, with five kids and multiple pregnancies between the two of them. Goodman personally tested and wore many of the dresses recommended on this list. This story was edited by Margaret Badore, a mom and the baby and kids gear editor for Forbes Vetted. We sought the expertise of Liz Teich, a New York-based stylist and mom, as well as Stitch Fix stylist Jillian Obarski for this piece. This story is regularly reviewed and refreshed for accuracy. It was last updated in June 2024, with the addition of two new brands: Minnow and Marion Maternity, as well as new styles from Nothing Fits But, H&M, Petal & Pup, Seraphine and more. How We Chose The Best Maternity Dresses To select the best maternity dresses, we tried many styles ourselves, as well as asked other moms to share their favorite maternity brands for formal events, workwear and every day. We also relied on research, reviews and our overall experience wearing other pieces from many of the maternity brands on this list throughout multiple pregnancies. We personally wore many of the maternity dresses included on this list, some during two different pregnancies. While not every dress made the cut, we made sure to include our favorite picks and the brands we gravitated to most. We asked mom friends to dish on the maternity dresses and brands they reached for most during pregnancy. We also made sure to include bestselling options from top maternity brands we’ve worn and loved and that are generally loved, trusted and recommended by pregnant women. We considered additional insight from our experts, two professional fashion stylists, on what to look for in the best maternity dresses to further help inform our selections. Every dress included received overwhelmingly positive reviews and high ratings from customers. What To Consider When Shopping For Maternity Dresses Whether you’re on the hunt for the perfect dress to rock at your baby shower or just looking for some easy, everyday options, we spoke with Stitch Fix stylist Jillian Obarski to get the lowdown on what makes a great maternity dress. Comfortable Materials Pregnancy can be uncomfortable, but your wardrobe shouldn’t be. When selecting the perfect maternity dress, Obarski recommends prioritizing soft, breathable fabrics like cotton to keep you cool and comfortable, especially during the summer months. “Stretchy materials like jersey and spandex blends are ideal for hugging your curves and highlighting your bump,” she says. “If form-fitting silhouettes are your speed, look for options that feature details like ruching on the sides or stretch around the belly to show off your bump. These styles can also be worn post-pregnancy, making them great investments.” Room To Grow You’ll want to look for dresses that can expand with you throughout pregnancy and ideally beyond. If you prefer a looser silhouette, Obarski suggests opting for an empire waistline, “which cinches right under the bust, accentuating the smallest part of your torso while providing plenty of room for your growing belly.” Other bump-friendly options she likes for expecting moms are A-line dresses and maxi dresses since they tend to have extra room around the midsection and will not compromise on style. “Also, consider dresses with adjustable ties (like a wrap dress) or elastic waistbands for a customized fit, ensuring you can move freely and comfortably as your bump grows.” Style According to Obarski, the most important thing to consider when shopping for the best maternity dresses is selecting a style that reflects your unique personal taste so you feel like yourself. Versatility Investing in good maternity clothes isn’t cheap so look for brands, like Hatch, Quince, Hill House Home and many others we’ve featured above, that are designed to be worn before, during and after pregnancy so you get your money’s worth. If you plan on nursing, you’ll definitely want to keep an eye out for maternity dresses with nursing-friendly tops for easy feeding on the go.

                    "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Sometimes you want a little something on your lips without necessarily going all out with lipstick. Maybe you want to look more pulled together when running errands or picking up your kid from school, but applying a pigmented lip product or shiny gloss feels extra. The best lip stains—like our top overall pick from Fenty Beauty—are great for those everyday, in-between moments, without requiring constant touch-ups. The best lip stains provide a gorgeous wash of color without drying out lips. ILLUSTRATION: FORBES / PHOTO: RETAILERS “Lip stains are designed to make you look fresh-faced and like you’re not trying too hard,” says celebrity makeup artist Jeannia Robinette, who’s a big proponent of the easy-to-apply, long-lasting tints. Newer formulations are buildable and provide a wash of color without drying out lips, so you look effortless and appropriate no matter the occasion. Below, we’ve rounded up some of best lip stains on the market. Best Lip Stain Overall: Fenty Beauty Poutsicle Hydrating Lip Stain Best Drugstore Lip Stain: E.L.F. Cosmetics Glossy Lip Stain Best Hydrating Lip Stain: Dior Addict Lip Tint Best Matte Lip Stain: Peripera Ink The Velvet Lip Tint Best Plumping Lip Stain: Milani Color Fetish Lip Stain Best Liquid Lip Stain: Benefit Benetint Best Luxury Lip Stain: Yves Saint Laurent Vinyl Cream Lip Stain Best Long-Lasting Lip Stain: L'Oréal Paris Makeup Rouge Signature Matte Lip Stain Best Lip Stain Pen: R.E.M. Practically Permanent Lip Stain Marker Best Lip Stain Kit: Wonderskin Wonder Blading Peel & Reveal Lip Stain Kit Best Lip Stain Overall A Hydrating Formula That Gives A Touch Of Color Fenty Beauty Fenty Beauty Poutsicle Hydrating Lip Stain Not only does the Fenty’s Poutsicle deliver a gorgeous wash of color, instead of drying out lips like stains of the past, it goes on glossy and instantly hydrates using squalane. It’s buildable with sheer-to-medium coverage that softens and smooths lips. Makeup artist and host of The Life Of A Makeup Artist podcast Jaleesa Jaikaran especially loves the vibrant color selection. Best Drugstore Lip Stain Fun Colors And A Glossy Finish e.l.f. Cosmetics E.L.F. Cosmetics Glossy Lip Stain If you’re all about that glazed look, you’ll love this long-lasting lip stain by E.L.F. Cosmetics. The non-drying formula is buildable and delivers a healthy dose of sheen. But despite the glossiness, it has a natural, subtle effect. One reviewer says, “I love that the stain that lasts for hours. It makes my lips look like they are naturally the shade I choose.” Another bonus is the convenient packaging: The stylish mini is the perfect size to throw in even your smallest clutch. And at this price point, you can get one to throw into all your bags. Best Hydrating Lip Stain A Luxurious, Cherry Seed Oil-Infused Formula Dior Dior Addict Lip Tint Looking for a balance of bold color with a subdued and matte finish? The Dior Addict Lip Tint checks all these boxes. The lip stain is available in 13 bold shades and comes in a semi-matte finish, yet is super hydrating thanks to a mix of cherry seed oil, glycerin and squalane. Robinette loves the line for its long-lasting wear and fun, pigmented colors. Best Matte Lip Stain A TikTok Favorite That Comes In A Wide Range Of Shades Amazon Peripera Ink The Velvet Lip Tint This TikTok sensation is the top-rated best-selling lip stain on Amazon, with over 17,000 5-star ratings—and it’s easy to see why. It doesn’t mess around when it comes to color. The wide range of shades, from dusty roses to deep reds and perky oranges, are intensely pigmented and glide on smoothly with an easy-to-apply applicator. One of the most impressive features is its all-day wear. Expect for it to stay put through your iced coffee, masks, workouts and more. Just be warned: The matte finish can leave lips on the drier side, so keep your favorite lip balm handy. Best Plumping Lip Stain A Top Pick That Enhances Lip Fullness Ulta Beauty Milani Color Fetish Lip Stain You can ditch the extra layer of lip balm with this TikTok-viral lip stain from Milani. Its hydrating formula includes hyaluronic acid and squalane, and it starts off with a glossy sheen for a full, plump look. It also has major staying power: Even as it wears through the day the pigment lasts for up to 8 hours, so there’s no need to constantly reapply. Best Liquid Lip Stain A Classic That Works For Most Skin Tones Sephora Benefit Benetint “This old school classic gives the best color,” says Robinette. Originally made for the nipples of exotic dancers in the 1970s, the rose-tinted stain soon rose to cult status thanks to the blushing glow it gave, perfect for lips and cheeks—yes, it’s a multitasker. One reviewer writes, “This product is a dream come true. It creates the most natural red, flushed cheeks and fruit punch lips. It’s long lasting and smells likes roses too!” The only downside is it can be a tad drying. It’s why Robinette recommends layering it with a balm like Carmex for a velvety finish. Best Luxury Lip Stain A Gorgeous Tint That Brings The Drama Walmart Yves Saint Laurent Vinyl Cream Lip Stain Here’s a lip stain with some major oomph: YSL’s Vinyl Cream Lip Stain provides more color (think full coverage) and shine than typical stains. We’d call it a special occasion stain. Plus, it’s very comfortable on the lips. And despise the intense gloss factor, it stays put for hours and hours (10 hours according to the brand), thanks in part to the diamond shaped wand—Jaikaran’s favorite feature—which allows for precise application even in the hard-to-reach corners of the mouth. Best Long-Lasting Lip Stain Our Top Tested Pick For Longevity Amazon L'Oréal Paris Makeup Rouge Signature Matte Lip Stain For those who can’t make up their mind if they want to go full-on lipstick or scale back with a stain, L’Oréal’s version offers the perfect compromise. According to the brand, it is designed to “deliver the high-color impact of a liquid lipstick with the no-makeup feel of a lip stain.” And according to our in-depth review, it does just that. It has comfortable matte finish, precise doe foot applicator, affordable price point and extensive 20-color range. But its real star power is its impressive staying power. You can rely on this stain to stick with you through multiple coffee cups, sweaty dance parties and even your big day—without the need to reapply. Best Lip Stain Pen A Pretty Pigment That's A Breeze To Apply MOST POPULAR Ulta Beauty R.E.M. Practically Permanent Lip Stain Marker It’s the fun marker-style applicator that makes this lip stain a no-brainer—just color in the pigmented formula. Apply generously for a bold statement lip or paint on a few light strokes for a more natural look. Either way, expect the color to stay put. In a study by the brand, 100% of users said the weightless stain did not bleed or run. Instead it offers a comfortable, non-drying feel. Best Lip Stain Kit A Semi-Permanent Formula That's The Real Deal WONDERSKIN Wonderskin Wonder Blading Peel & Reveal Lip Stain Kit If you’ve got some time, this kit will give your lips color that will actually last all day. First you apply a couple layers of the bluish-purple pigment across your lips (don’t let the Halloween-ish color scare you—this is not the final shade). Let that settle for for 10 to 15 seconds for a soft hue or up to 30 to 45 seconds for a bolder shade. Next, spray one to three pumps of the activator until your lips are damp. According to the brand you may experience some tingling sensation on your lips and a sweet taste. After a few seconds, starting at the corner of your mouth, grab a bit of the masque and peel it off to reveal the final look. They’re not kidding either when they say the color won’t budge; in fact, to get the product off you have to use an oil-based cleaner or makeup remover. One reviewer says, “For about 20 years I’ve been trying to find something that looks natural, wears all day, and doesn’t feel dry or crusty on my lips. This product does the trick: It doesn’t really moisturize, but it doesn’t dry out my lips, either. It’s like how my lips feel with nothing on them—completely natural.” MORE FROMFORBES VETTED The 10 Best Futons That Are Comfortable, Functional And Stylish By Korin Miller Contributor The Best Mattress For Lightweight Sleepers Promotes Plusher Comfort By Nicole M.

Every iteration of this story was edited by deputy editor Jane Sung, who’s covered beauty and style for 15-plus years. She leads our beauty and grooming section. We reached out to makeup artists Jeannia Robinette and Jaleesa Jaikaran for personal recommendations, application tips, insight on ingredient formulations and more. This article is regularly updated to ensure the accuracy of prices, list placements and product availability. In our June 2024 update, lifestyle editorial assistant Whitney Bruno added the Milani Color Fetish Lip Stain. How We Chose The Best Lip Stains To compile our list of the best lip stains, we looked at options from top beauty brands and considered customer reviews from popular retailers. When narrowing down our list, we prioritized top-rated lip stains across different price points. We also considered formulation effectiveness for a variety of lip concerns. Tested insights were incorporated when deciding our winners. Our top pick for longevity, the L’Oréal Paris Makeup Rouge Signature Matte Lip Stain, was thoroughly evaluated by our staffers. We also consulted with makeup artists for expert advice on what to look for in the best lip stains. What To Look For In A Lip Stain Between shade range, finish and applicator type, there are several factors to consider in a lip stain. Here’s what to keep in mind. Hydrating Ingredients Lip stains are great for their longwearing power but the downside is they can leave your lips dry and wrinkly. Robinette recommends looking for formulas that contain hydrating ingredients like squalane, oils, and botanical extracts. You want your lips to feel good, she says. And if there’s a drier formulation or shade you absolutely love, just layer a lip balm on top to keep your lips moisturized. Finish Traditionally stains came in drier matte or satin finishes but new formulations can be glossy, too. Choosing a finish really depends on your comfort level (can you handle a drier pout or will you be happier with a little hydration?) and the look you’re going for. Applicator Stains come packaged in a few different ways. The most common include a nail polish style bottle with brush applicator, a marker or a tube with doe foot applicator. Test a few to find the option that’s most comfortable for you to use. Be warned: It’s easy to apply too much product with a brush so if you’re going with that option Robinette says start with a dab and blend it out before adding more. How Do You Apply Lip Stain? Before you reach for your lip stain, exfoliate your lips with a lip scrub, says Robinette. “I don’t know one person on the planet that doesn’t have dry lips, and you have to care for them first,” says the expert. Once your pout is prepped, she says to use your finger to apply the stain and blend it into your lip. What’s The Difference Between Lip Stain And Lipstick? Lipsticks are usually creamier and have fuller coverage, which makes it the best choice when you want a bolder, vibrant look, says Jaikaran. Lip stains on the other hand are meant to look more sheer and natural. “They carry a watery consistency that absorbs easily into the lips, leaving a wash of color that usually lasts for a long time,” says the expert. In most cases if you want an effortless look that’s long-lasting, go with a lip stain. What Are The Benefits Of Using A Lip Stain? Lip stains provide a more natural look for when you want a little something on your lips without wearing a thicker lipstick or high-shine gloss. They are lightweight and low maintenance. The biggest selling point is that lip stains stay on for hours, making them perfect for busy people who don’t have time to reapply throughout the day.

The Moonbird breathing device is designed to coach you on how to use breath work to lower anxiety, reduce stress and sleep better. It fits in the palm of your hand and expands and contracts so you can follow along with your breath. The Moonbird connects to a meditation app that can track your breathing, provide biofeedback and guide you through specific meditations. I’ve used meditation apps before, and anytime I try to meditate my mind wanders. In fact, it wanders so far that I forget I was trying to meditate in the first place. But this little hand-held breath coach breathed with me in my palm, so it made it hard to forget the mental mission. For anyone looking to improve their sleep using meditation or breath work, the Moonbird might be a ... [+] worthy investment. Illustration: Forbes / Photo: Retailer I tested the Moonbird breathing device twice a day for three weeks. I wanted to see if it would help me fall asleep faster (because of my wandering mind) and if it would help me keep my stress levels down, especially while traveling. While I’m not sure I’ll use it long term, it was definitely more effective than a meditation app and a whole lot cheaper than an in-person meditation coach (which I used to spend $100 an hour on and would usually end up falling asleep during). Check out my full Moonbird review to understand how it works, why it might be useful and whether it’s worth trying. Moonbird Moonbird Our score: 8/10 | Delivery: Free | Warranty: Two years | Colors: 4 Best for: Those who think meditation and breath work could help their mental health People who struggle with meditation on their own Those who’d like to sleep better Skip if: You don’t like the idea of carrying a device around with you You don’t have trouble meditating on your own or with an app MORE FROMFORBES VETTED The 10 Best Lip Stains That Stay Vibrant All Day By Tina Chadha Contributor The Best Maternity Dresses To Suit Every Trimester And Occasion By Lex Goodman Contributor Moonbird Features A Breathing Device That Fits In Your Hand The Moonbird device fits in the palm of my hand and is made of a super-smooth material, which the company says is 100% biocompatible medical-grade silicone. It contours to my palm, and it feels similar to the glossy “worry” stone I usually keep in my purse. There’s a thumb sensor at the top that signals the Moonbird to start working. This sensor is how the device provides you with biofeedback via the app (but more on that later). My favorite part is the way it feels when it’s “breathing” along with you. The Moonbird has the high-tech equivalent of a balloon inside of it that expands and contracts to simulate breathing. I imagine it feels similar to holding a small mouse or hamster in your hand and feeling it breathe. I’m not sure why you’d do that, but that’s the best way I can describe it. This is how you hold the Moonbird without the thumb on the sensor. Shannon Ullman For Forbes I matched my breathing with the device, which made it much easier to concentrate on breathing instead of thinking of what I wanted for lunch. At times, it felt like the Moonbird didn’t lead me to breathe deeply enough, or it started exhaling before I was ready. But maybe that’s the point. The Choice Is Yours Whether To Use The Meditation App You don’t need to use the Moonbird app to use the device. If you don’t have a smartphone or if sitting with your screen doesn’t really sound like your idea of unwinding or falling asleep, you can skip it. However, if you appreciate a bit more guidance, you like keeping track of data or you’re a true biohacker at heart, the app is a nice touch. Personally, I didn’t love using the app because it felt more forced. I preferred just holding the Moonbird in my hand while reading a book or watching TV so that my breathing synced up without me thinking too much about it. A screenshot of the Guides section on the Moonbird app. Shannon Ullman For Forbes The Moonbird connects to the app via Bluetooth, so it can sync with different breathing exercises. Under the app’s “Guide” section, there’s a series of recordings that introduce you to breath-work basics, best practices and breath-work education. There are guided meditations for sleep, anxiety and stress that pair with the Moonbird device for different breathing sequences. A screenshot of the breathing exercises on the Moonbird app. Shannon Ullman For Forbes I typically tested the anxiety and stress meditations around midday to take a break from work and the sleep meditations before bed. I liked having the option to turn the sound off in the app but still receive the breathing guidance through the hand-held device. You can change the duration of the guided meditation and measure your heart rate variability (HRV). I also like that you can set up notifications so the app reminds you to practice your breathing throughout the day. Track Your Health Stats Through The App If you’re into biohacking and tracking your health stats, you’ll definitely want to download the Moonbird app. While syncing the Moonbird to the app, it reads your heart rate variability (HRV), which is the variation in time between heartbeats. A screenshot of the HRV reading while doing box breathing on the moonbird app. Shannon Ullman For Forbes According to Moonbird, a high HRV means you can quickly recover from stress, calm down and fall asleep. A low HRV means you aren’t able to recover from stress easily, which can cause anxiety, insomnia and pain. I like that the app shows me my HRV for each session and how I’m tracking over time. This way, I can see if I’m making progress through the breathing practices to increase my HRV overall. It’s interesting that the app can show this information, but I’m not sure how helpful it is for me to know my HRV. I guess it’s proof that the breathing exercises are working at the moment, and if I see my number go up, it’s a bit of a reward that makes me want to keep going. Other than a quick hit of motivation, I’m not sure that this information is useful to me. A screenshot of my statistics while using the moonbird. Shannon Ullman Moonbird Breathing Coach: The Verdict For the price of the Moonbird (nearly $200), some people might think it’s an unnecessary expense, especially when you can use a meditation app for free. However, if you’re serious about learning how to meditate or practice breath work, this could be seen as an investment. Anyone who struggles with sitting still and breathing, like me, knows that meditation apps and YouTube videos are cheap and easy, but they don’t always work. Having something in my hand that’s keeping me on track with my breathing is much more effective. Does my mind still wander? Sure, but my breathing naturally follows the Moonbird without much thought needed. I didn’t find the HRV data particularly helpful, and I don’t even think you need the app. If you use free meditation apps or videos and follow them just fine, you probably don’t need to spend the money on the Moonbird. If you could use some help and have considered a meditation teacher, the Moonbird could save you money in the long run. It’s small enough that it fits in my purse, so I might try replacing my worry stone with the Moonbird the next time I go to the dentist or fly on a plane. I’m really interested in how the long-term use of the Moonbird will affect my breathing when I’m not using it. How I Tested The Moonbird I tested the Moonbird over the course of three weeks, using it twice a day, once around midday and once before bed. I kept track of my mood and anxiety levels before using the device and afterward, and I tried to time how quickly I fell asleep each night after using it. I monitored how long the battery lasted before needing to be charged as well. I also experimented with carrying the device around in my purse to see how much weight it added and how cumbersome it was. Additionally, I kept an eye on the device itself to monitor if it had any wear and tear over time.

The Moonbird is a device you hold in your hand to guide your breathing. It expands and contracts to help you pace your breath work and achieve a better rhythm, ultimately aiming to improve your sleep and decrease your anxiety and stress. What Is The Difference Between Moonbird And Sensate? The Moonbird is a device that contracts and expands in your hand to help with breath work and meditation, ultimately designed to enhance sleep and reduce anxiety, while the Sensate is a sensory device you put on your chest while listening to audio. It uses vibrations and sound to lower stress and anxiety and improve sleep. The devices have similar goals but different methods of achieving them. How Long Does The Moonbird’s Battery Last? Moonbird says the battery lasts two hours when fully charged and takes about three hours to fully charge. In my testing I found the battery lasts slightly less than two hours. The charger attaches to the device via magnets. You can tell the battery is charged if you open the Moonbird app and see the battery icon is full.

                    "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Whenever I shave—and when I’m not otherwise testing manual razors for work—I always prefer an electric shaver. The best electric razors for men eliminate the worries that come with a manual shave, such as ingrown hairs, razor burn, bumps, irritation and more. After testing eight models, I chose the Braun Series 9 Pro 9419S Electric Razor as the best overall winner for its top-notch performance and useful features. The BaBylissPro Barberology GoldFX Double Foil Electric Razor is my pick for the best value option. (I also wrote in-depth reviews of the Braun and BaBylissPro devices.) I tested eight worthy contenders to land on the very best electric razors for men. Illustration: Forbes / Photo: Adam Hurly For Forbes Here’s a list of my four winners based on my firsthand experience: Best Electric Razor For Men Overall: Braun Series 9 Pro 9419S Best Value Electric Razor For Men: BaBylissPro Barberology GoldFX Best Rotary Electric Razor For Men: Philips Norelco 9800 Best Upgrade Electric Razor For Men: Panasonic Arc6 The major contenders for best electric shavers for men are mostly big-name brands you might recognize and may have spotted in my review of the top beard trimmers. It takes a lot of technology, research and quality materials to deliver a high-quality shaver, so the key players tend to be those stalwart brands. My testing for the cream of the crop focused largely on newer models as well as longtime favorites. I’ve also provided a nine-month update for three of my top picks, so you can glean how these razors hold up over time. Best Electric Razor For Men Overall An Ultra-Close Shaver That Wins Where It Matters Most Amazon Braun Series 9 Pro 9419S Key features: Two foil shavers and two crossbar/lifting shavers, protective SkinGuard bar, auto adjustments for thicker beards, pop-up trimmer, LED battery display | Tested charge time: 1 hour | Tested runtime: 4 hours 55 minutes | Tested 5-minute quick-charge runtime: 6 minutes | Wet usage: 100% waterproof | Optional add-ons: Charging and cleaning station, leather travel charging case | Warranty: 2 years Best for: Mimicking an ultra-close manual shave Precise trimming and tidying facial hair perimeters Shower shavers or those who prefer using shaving cream Skip if: You shave infrequently or sparsely While Braun’s Series 9 Pro shaver didn’t get the gold medal in any duration-tested category, such as runtime or charge, it performed better where it matters most. Chief among the reasons, it indisputably delivers the closest shave. I felt like I had shaved with a manual razor whenever I used it, and I actually needed a post-shave application to calm the skin. Electric razors rarely give you this sensation, since they have a natural buffer between blades and skin. But Braun’s device is truly next-level in that way. It also has a useful suite of features—most notably, an incredible detailing trimmer. Because it rises above the device head, it’s terrific for drawing clean lines around the perimeter of your facial hair. In my testing, the Braun Series 9 Pro indisputably delivered the closest shave. ADAM HURLY FOR FORBES As for numbers: There’s nothing paltry about a runtime of four hours 55 minutes (on a 60-minute charge). I do wish it had a better quick-charge performance, as it ran for only six minutes on a five-minute charge. Still, should it ever actually hit 0% battery (which I doubt you’d ever let it do), you could probably still do a full shave in that six-minute window, since this thing gave me the best clean on a single pass compared to all other options. I even tried it on four-day whiskers one day (which is a no-no if you want an efficient shave), and it mowed through probably 75% of them on the first go. The Braun's pop-up trimmer is especially handy for drawing clean lines around the perimeter of your ... [+] facial hair. Adam Hurly For Forbes My nine-month update: While I stand by my review and still think that Braun has the most sophisticated electric razor on the market, I have also not been reaching for it as readily as I had previously planned. As someone who shaves just his neckline and cheek lines regularly (and the rest infrequently), I feel a bit silly using something so juiced up for the job. This device can do everything, but if you only need a shaver to do one thing, maybe it’s a little too fancy for you. Still, I won’t be parting with it anytime soon. The 2024 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards are here: Explore our 150 top-recommended items across categories after extensive research and testing. Best Value Electric Razor For Men A No-Frills, High-Powered Pick Amazon BaBylissPro Barberology GoldFX Key features: Two foil shavers, auto-locking lid, charge indicator light | Tested charge time: 2 hours 20 minutes | Tested runtime: 3 hours 10 minutes | Tested 5-minute quick-charge runtime: 5 minutes | Wet usage: Rinsable head, wet shave okay | Optional add-ons: None | Warranty: 2 years Best for: A straightforward, efficient and ultra-close shave Infrequent shavers and travelers Those who only shave their necks Skip if: You want bonus features beyond the simple shave When you think of “best value,” you may think it means “the most options for less money.” And while BaBylissPro’s beautiful, gilded foil shaver is one of the less expensive options from my roster, it also has the fewest features. In fact, it shaves with only two foil heads. So how did it get the distinction in this category? In short, BaBylissPro’s shaver is terrific for paving pristine necklines, periodic all-over cleanups and on-the-go necessities. It’s ideal for the person who needs a reliable device without any extra features. That person is going to get an incredibly efficient and razor-close shave without having to spend $300 on a more complex device. The BaBylissPro electric razor is ideal for the person who needs a reliable device without any extra ... [+] features. Adam Hurly For Forbes And for what it’s worth, that sexy gold shell is strong. It’s got some serious heft, weighing in at 12.1 ounces. I accidentally dropped it on my hard tile floor (not because it’s slippery, but because I was carrying far too many things and didn’t secure it), and there was no damage. The lid popped off, and that’s it. Not even a scratch or a dent on the shell. Besides looking good, the device itself is very durable—surviving a drop test without a scratch. Adam Hurly For Forbes My nine-month update: Of the three top awardees, the BaBylissPro has been getting the most mileage from me. That has a lot to do with two things: I primarily just shave my neck and cheeks, and I want something smaller for when I travel. Aside from its gold shell losing some luster with continued handling and toting, I have absolutely zero complaints to lodge about this device. My shaver-reticent partner has started using it too; he has a perfectly good beard trimmer to maintain his neckline (the Philips Norelco Multigroom 9000), but has opted into the shaver a few times because of my endorsement. He has curlier facial hair than me, so normally I’d suggest he try the Philips Norelco shaver, but all’s been going well with this professional-grade foil shaver instead. Best Rotary Electric Razor For Men A Must-Own Device For Coarse, Unruly Or Ingrown-Prone Whiskers Amazon Philips Norelco 9800 Key features: Three rotary panels, pop-up trimmer, OLED battery display | Tested charge time: 1 hour | Tested runtime: 2 hours 55 minutes | Tested 5-minute quick-charge runtime: 3.5 minutes | Wet usage: Rinsable head, wet shave okay | Optional add-ons: Cleaning and charging station | Warranty: 2 years Best for: Thick hairs, awkward growth patterns and ingrown-prone stubble Those who want to shave parts of their facial hair—but not all of it Those who want to shave less frequently (every three days or so) Skip if: You need to shave daily You want an ultra-close shave Rotary razors get an unfairly bad rap in the e-shaver game, because they don’t typically cut as close as foil heads. But why is that a negative? In fact, some guys prefer this, particularly those who have curly, coarse and ingrown-prone stubble. The Philips Norelco 9800 glides seamlessly around the contours of the face, while the panels and head flex every which way. This makes it easy to cut sporadic growth patterns (for the guy whose whiskers angle every which way when they grow out). The Philips Norelco 9800 is especially great for those with curly, coarse and ingrown-prone stubble. Adam Hurly For Forbes What makes this the best rotary razor in the game goes beyond this effective trimming; you’ll also get a super-close shave on the first pass, no matter how difficult your hair tries to be. It’s among the more intuitive devices, and its OLED screen easily guides you on locking the tool between uses. Its pop-up trimmer rises high enough in the back to allow for good detailing visibility. And because of the spacing of each panel, this device is far and away the easiest to rinse and maintain—another benefit of rotary head designs, in my opinion. If my partner were writing this article, the Philips Norelco 9800 rotary razor would be the top winner. He’s got thicker whiskers and more stubborn stubble than me (not to mention a lower pain threshold when it comes to shaving, so he appreciates the less-close finish). The Philips Norelco's pop-up trimmer rises high enough in the back to allow for good detailing ... [+] visibility. Adam Hurly For Forbes My nine-month update: I have really not been shaving my full face lately, and I find it difficult and a little unnecessary to target the rotary shaver on just my cheeks and neck. This device really lends itself to an all-over sweeping-style shave, wherein you just zig and zag every which way as you catch each hair. Conversely, I have been getting mileage with it as a shoulder and upper back shaver, since it hugs the shoulders so nicely and also eats the back hairs that choose to grow in a dozen different directions with no pattern whatsoever. So, while I stand by my appreciation for it as a device (especially for ingrown-prone guys and those with curly beard hair), I am finding that it’s difficult to incorporate regularly unless you need a full shave on the regular. Best Upgrade Electric Razor For Men A Boundary-Pushing, Standard-Setting Shaver Amazon Panasonic Arc6 Key features: Four foil shavers and two crossbar shavers, pop-up trimmer, LED battery and cleanliness display | Tested charge time: 49 minutes | Tested runtime: 6 hours 55 minutes | Tested 5-minute quick-charge runtime: 64 minutes | Wet usage: 100% waterproof | Optional add-ons: Cleaning and charging station | Warranty: 2 years Best for: An industry-high six-razor head, a nearly seven-hour tested runtime and an impressive 22-position head pivot Those whose shave pattern is inconsistent; this can lift and cut errant hairs A zero-to-60 quick charge (in my case 64 minutes after a five-minute charge) Skip if: You prefer a more basic or streamlined device It’s too much of an investment I chose the Panasonic for its impressive runtime and quick-charge metrics: The brand advertised a one-hour runtime, yet I was getting nearly seven hours. Granted, if the device were flush against my whiskers for that long, adjusting its cutting strength and demands as it mowed through hairs, then maybe it wouldn’t last quite as long. But surely, it would still blow the competition out of the water. (The next two closest models in my testing, the Braun Series 9 Pro and the Panasonic Arc5, lasted four hours 55 minutes and four hours 50 minutes, respectively.) Plus, a five-minute quick charge is advertised to provide five minutes of shaving time; my five-minute quick charge generated 64 minutes of runtime. The Panasonic Arc6 has a slew of features—a six-razor head, nearly 7-hour tested runtime and an ... [+] impressive 22-position head pivot—to make it worthy of the best upgrade razor award. Adam Hurly For Forbes Performance-wise, this thing will reward you for your investment. It didn’t leave the skin as tingly as the Braun did, but both my partner and I could still run our hands with the grain of the stubble and feel the total smoothness of our faces. As the one with a more unruly facial hair growth pattern, I found this shaver adept—perhaps marginally better than the Braun—at tackling errant hairs in a single pass. To be fair, though, the Arc5 did the same, and with one less foil blade. So if you choose the Arc6 over the Arc5, it’s for those impressive metrics that blow every other device out of the water. I found the six-razor head to give ultra smooth results. Adam Hurly For Forbes Panasonic’s latest device is worth the money. It’s setting the standard for other brands and far outpaces its predecessor, which itself remains one of the best in class. But I found that it gave me a slightly less-close shave than the Braun, and at the end of the day, that was the most heavily weighted scoring category. But when you tally everything else, it makes perfect sense to put your money behind the sheer bar-raising muscle here. MORE FROMFORBES VETTED The 10 Best Lip Stains That Stay Vibrant All Day By Tina Chadha Contributor The Best Maternity Dresses To Suit Every Trimester And Occasion By Lex Goodman Contributor Other Electric Razors I Tested For this story, I rounded up the top dozen devices based on research, reviews, reputation and conversations with my most trusted barber and other grooming sources. I narrowed that list down to the eight most likely contenders, including the four distinct picks above. Below are the other four products I tested. My testing for the cream of the shaving crop focused largely on newer models from Braun, Panasonic ... [+] and more. Adam Hurly For Forbes Andis Resurge Electric Razor: I find this pro-favorite shaver wonderfully straightforward, with its two flexible foil heads and a crossbar blade, but it doesn’t have the same pivoting powers or sheer muscle as the other horses in this race. It also placed in the lower middle of the pack across tested charge time, runtime and five-minute quick charge. Panasonic Arc5 Electric Razor: If you want a 5-star device that is next to perfect, then the Arc5 is yours for the taking. But the Arc6 does outperform it across the board—the newer device lasts about 40% longer, charges just a few minutes faster and blows the Arc5 out of the water on that five-minute quick charge (64 minutes versus 39). Wahl Professional 5-Star Series Shaver: Another pro-grade foil shaver, Wahl’s would be my top pick for on-the-go usage, since it is so lightweight despite managing some heavy lifting. And while I appreciated its impressively fast charge, LED status bars and relatively quiet trimming, it just didn’t have the same muscle, lasting power or once-over cleanliness that others on the roster provided. Hatteker Electric Razor: This electric razor was nowhere near the front of the field here, and its low cost reflected that. Compared to the other main rotary shaver in this race—the Philips Norelco—there was no contest in terms of muscle, efficiency and once-over tidiness. Pass. How I Tested The Best Electric Razors For Men Here are the top factors I weighed when choosing the best electric razor, in order of importance. My partner tested the devices as well, to double the efforts and to measure them against his thicker stubble and more sensitive skin. Performance Efficiency Of the tested devices, seven of the eight gave me a super-smooth, even shave. I tested each of them on one- and two-day stubble (since that’s usually the cutoff for using an electric shaver without first requiring a beard trimmer). However, the bar was set by those devices that gave me the cleanest results on the first pass, requiring the fewest repeat passes despite my hair growth patterns changing all across my face. You’ll see a lot of numbers from big brands around how many cuts per minute a razor can administer, but this is fairly nominal, because obviously the more blades it has, the more cuts it can technically administer. You don’t need some 80,000 cuts per minute. You need an efficient, powerful first pass. Don’t get distracted by the numbers; more isn’t always better. Power And Longevity The best electric shavers should last long on a full charge, and they should cut with some serious muscle, too (which more or less supports the first bullet on my checklist). And though a near seven-hour runtime is impressive (that’d be the Panasonic Arc6), there is a threshold for what is necessary to be a top-tier pick, and what is a bonus on top of that. For example, my top pick, the Braun Series 9 Pro, still impressed with a near five-hour runtime. Both take just shy of an hour to charge. Ease Of Use I look at ease of use in two ways. First, is the device intuitive for first-time users? Are its functions obvious and practical? Secondly, does it glide easily across the face? That maneuverability (and flexibility, where pertinent) plays a big role in this scoring category. Durability In large part, I picked a high-quality group of shavers, with one exception (because I wanted to see if the Hatteker could surprise me). So you won’t hear a ton about durability in this article, since the names Braun, Philips Norelco, Panasonic, Wahl and BaBylissPro are more or less synonymous with quality, especially at this price point. That being said, I accidentally dropped the BaByliss Pro on my hard tile floor and it showed neither damage nor wear, which was impressive to me. Built-In Features Most of these devices have add-on features like charging stands or self-cleaning stations. Those are helpful, but I’m not grading on those curves. Instead, I’m considering the built-in features, like a trimming extension, a travel lock, various shaving heads, an LED display and so on. That being said, built-in features are important, except when they’re not. The BaBylissPro doesn’t have any such bonus features, yet it’s an incredibly durable, powerful, close-shaving workhorse. How To Pick An Electric Razor For Men There are a few things that separate the best electric razors from the pack. Here are the standards you should hold them to, with insights from the grooming experts I interviewed. Foil Vs. Rotary Shavers While there is a general consumer preference for foil shavers over rotary ones, rotary options are still optimal for a certain group of users. Foil shavers tend to cut near to the skin’s surface, replicating the manual shave more closely (literally), notes Philadelphia-based barber Eric Becker. Foil shavers are better for sensitive skin and for short stubble, though the proximity of the shave can also necessitate a soothing post-shave cream. On the other hand, rotary shavers are better for shaving select areas of the face and for trimming hair that grows in all different directions, since you use it in circular motions to nix all those errant hairs. Rotary shavers are better also for hair that is slightly longer, like three days’ length (though it’s recommended to try to shave every day or every other, for the easiest job). Rotary shavers, like the Philips Norelco 9800, are especially good for shaving select areas of the ... [+] face and for trimming unruly hair growth. Adam Hurly For Forbes Cordlessness No excuses here; your electric razor should absolutely have cordless use. These aren’t barbershop hair clippers (which are usually cordless these days, too). Even the most powerful electric shavers can hold a good charge for two to seven hours without needing to be plugged in. They’ll get hot, and you won’t ever need them to run for two hours (much less seven) on end. But you should be able to get a half dozen or more sessions on a single device (even the lower-cost ones) without requiring a recharge. Battery Life Look for 30-plus minutes, minimum, but ideally upward of 60 or 90 minutes. Again, the best ones will last months on end without needing a re-up. All of my top four picks in this list range from two hours 55 minutes (the Philips Norelco 9800) to six hours 55 minutes (the Panasonic Arc6). Know that the bar is high in this category. Waterproofness “Waterproof” means different things to different people, but when you see it on a product’s packaging, it likely means that the device is 100% waterproof. If you see only “wet/dry usage” listed, then it is probably merely rinsable and suitable for use with a shaving cream. At the very least, your device’s head should be able to rinse cleanly under running water, in order to mitigate bacterial accumulation and hair buildup. It’s a bonus, though, if the tool can handle shaving in the shower (meaning, it’s fully waterproof) or being used along with shaving cream or a similar product. If you do shave in the shower, though, be careful about your grip; the device’s longevity won’t hold up if you keep dropping it. Additional Features Your electric razor doesn’t need to have any attachments unless you want it to perform multiple functions. For example, some have swappable heads for trimming or detailing longer hairs. The bestsellers tend to have a pop-up trimmer that allows for drawing clean lines or spot-check trimming prior to shaving down. But that’s secondary to the primary task at hand—shaving cleanly and efficiently. My Expertise I’ve been covering grooming for 10 years, and for numerous outlets. Besides Forbes, I write for GQ, Men’s Journal, SPY, Robb Report and more. There’s a good chance I’ve helped you make an informed grooming purchase or perhaps clarified the benefits of a specific skincare ingredient. Even while currently based in Portugal, I receive dozens of products a week from the latest U.S. brands, which I am constantly trialing in order to stay on top of the latest and greatest industry happenings. This tested package, which includes accompanying in-depth reviews of the top pick from Braun and best value winner from BaBylissPro, was overseen by deputy editor Jane Sung, who has more than 15 years’ experience covering grooming and shaving products. For this piece, I also tapped into the expertise of three grooming professionals for advice on how different versions offer specific results as well as shopping guidance for buying an e-shaver: Ryan Gonzalez is the cofounder of San Francisco-based grooming goods store Church California. Eric Becker is a barber and national education director at Blind Barber in Philadelphia. Melissa DeZarate is a men’s celebrity stylist whose clients include Henry Golding, Conan Gray and Leon Bridges. What Is The Most Efficient Electric Razor? According to my research, testing and expert intel, the Braun Series 9 Pro 9419s Electric Shaver is the most efficient model on the market. The waterproof, cordless foil razor uses proprietary technology to sense beard density and adjust its power accordingly. The versatile tool also has a pop-up trimming and detailing head to cover all your hair cleanup bases. “The Braun Series 9 Pro has been the go-to professional shaver for a while,” says Becker. “Its ease of use as well as charging and [optional] self-cleaning stand make it hard to beat. Is There An Electric Razor That Shaves As Close As A Blade? Generally speaking, an electric razor doesn’t offer as close of a shave as a manual blade, since electric razors don’t actually breach the surface of the skin. However, there is one exception: the Braun Series 9 Pro 9419s Electric Shaver. This razor delivers an incredibly close shave that rivals any manual blade and doesn’t cause any irritation. Depending on your needs, however, it can be beneficial to keep both an e-shaver and manual blade on hand. While manual blades are reliable for achieving an ultra-smooth look, Becker recommends electric razors for those concerned about ingrown hairs. “It’s easier and tends to be faster,” he says. “Plus, if you are looking to maintain your beard and neckline, you are less likely to cut the wrong hair.” Which Is Better, A Foil Or Rotary Electric Shaver? Rotary and foil shavers both provide an exceptional shave, but each has its own characteristics. If you have longer and thicker hair or like to go days in between shaves (two or even three days, for some guys), then a rotary razor is best. It’s also good for those with coarser beard hair, thanks to the circular heads that easily maneuver tougher hair patterns seamlessly. Foil shavers add a precise method of hair removal that’s especially ideal if you have fine to medium strands. Celebrity stylist Melissa DeZarate prefers to use foil shavers on her clients because of the closeness the foil heads allow; on a red carpet or in an editorial shoot, that nominal difference can be big, especially if the client is in public for half a day or more. If you do choose a rotary shaver, she advises staying on top of the blade replacements in order to prevent hairs snagging in dull blades after extended use. How Long Do Electric Razors Last? With proper care, electric razors can last for five or more years. “How you use the shaver and take care of it will really dictate how long it lasts,” says Ryan Gonzalez, cofounder of San Francisco-based grooming goods store Church California. “Many people break the foil by dropping it a few times; others neglect to lubricate often enough and the razors become dull or splintered.” To increase the longevity of your device, clean the shaving heads after each use, and swap them out approximately every 12 to 18 months. Are Expensive Electric Razors Worth It? If you want a grooming tool that’s going to stand the test of time, it’s worth investing in one from a reputable brand. The top four devices on my list each cost more than $100—from the BaByliss Pro at $140 to the Panasonic Arc6 at $400—and you can really notice the elevated quality. Plus, Braun, BaByliss, Philips Norelco and Panasonic all offer a 2-year warranty for manufacturing and material issues, ensuring the longevity of your device.

After testing nine of the most popular standing desks over several weeks, my recommendation for the best standing desk is the Branch Duo. It had the best blend of features and functions of any desk I tested, and it’s aesthetically pleasing, too. Even after six months of testing, I still find this desk to be comfortable, effective and user-friendly. If you’re seeking a slightly larger standing desk with a bamboo top, the Fully Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk was best runner-up. After testing nine of the most popular standing desks over several weeks, my recommendation for the ... [+] best standing desk is the Branch Duo. ILLUSTRATION: FORBES / PHOTO: RETAILERS Here are all the winners from my testing process: Best Standing Desk Overall: Branch Duo Best Runner-Up Standing Desk: Fully Jarvis Bamboo Best Upgrade Standing Desk: Steelcase Solo Sit-to-Stand Desk Best Customizable Standing Desk: Uplift V2 Best Standing Desk for Small Spaces: Seville Classics Airlift Electric Standing Desk Best Budget Standing Desk: FEZIBO Height Adjustable Electric Desk with Storage There are compelling reasons to make a standing desk part of your office or WFH set-up. “Sitting at a desk for extended periods can have various downsides; some of my colleagues have referred to sitting as the ‘silent killer,’” said physiotherapist Lalitha Bhowani-McSorley. While Bhowani-McSorley acknowledges that may be an exaggeration, she points out that sitting too much can have real consequences: “Individuals who sit for long periods of time will often see an increase in the risk of weight gain, cardiovascular problems and metabolic issues.” She adds that excessive sitting can lead to poor posture, weak core muscles and tight hip flexors. If that has you convinced to start spending more time out of your chair, look for a standing desk that is easy to use, has accessories that are functional for your work habits and environment (like a desk drawer if you want office supplies tucked out of sight, or a cable management tray if you’re bothered by the sight of dangling cords) and—most importantly—that meets height and space requirements for you and your space. Read on for my review of six of the best standing desks to consider, based on my first-hand experience. Best Standing Desk Overall The Best Combination Of Features And Function MOST POPULAR Branch Branch Duo Standing Desk Dimensions: 36 x 24 inches, 48 x 24 inches | Height Range: 28 inches (minimum); 47.8 inches (maximum) | Memory Settings: 2 | Motor: Dual | Weight Capacity: 275 pounds | Warranty: 10 years Best for: If you want reminders to sit or stand Cable management and small accessory storage Small spaces Skip if: You need a larger desktop You want a push-button controller For its sturdy design, attractive finish options and multi-functional paddle controller, the Branch Duo won best standing desk in my tests. Six months later, it’s still my go-to desk.. It’s compact enough to fit in small spaces but doesn’t feel like a compromise on features or design. One feature that impressed me is its built-in reminder to sit or stand, a thoughtful addition not found on any other desk I tested (although a few models offer this functionality as an add-on or option within an app). During long periods of focused work, I find it tough to remember to change positions, ignoring what ergonomist Matt Jeffs calls postural fatigue. “Brushed aside long enough, postural fatigue advances to discomfort,” he notes. “Overlooked further, discomfort becomes pain.” This standing desk gave me the impetus I needed to keep up with a regular rotation of sitting versus standing to avoid postural fatigue. It has a total lift range of 19.8 inches, with a minimum height setting of 28 inches and a maximum height setting of 47.8 inches. That range should be sufficient for most people, although the desktop doesn’t reach quite as high as a few other desks I tested, which have an upper height limit of 50 inches or more. Thanks to a built-in reminder to stand, the Branch Duo stood out among other desks I tested. Erica Puisis The height settings are controlled by a simple paddle controller that you push down or pull up to move the desk and there are two memory positions for your preferred sitting and standing heights, which I find to be a handy shortcut to reaching my Goldilocks settings. With a helpful but unobtrusive OLED display screen that dims after input, it’s more discreet than your average touch-button controlpad but also has a slightly steeper learning curve. An optional sit-or-stand reminder alerts you when it’s time to change position, either with a visual cue on the controller’s display screen or via a vibration that resonates across the desk (especially helpful if you’ve become drowsy during a mid-afternoon work session). These settings and options are controlled with two small buttons on either side of the controller. There are enough customization options to make this desk appealing for just about any office or home workspace, including five options for the laminated desktop and three colors for the powder-coated steel legs. If you have a small space, the 36 x 24-inch standing desk is your best bet. If you have a little more room to work with, then take advantage of the slightly larger 48 x 24-inch option (which is what I used during testing). It provided more than enough room for my laptop stand, wireless keyboard, mouse, a notebook and a cup of coffee. In the last six months of testing, I also added a freestanding 24-inch monitor and still feel like there’s plenty of work surface available. The desk is powered by a dual-motor lift system (which is usually faster and quieter than a single motor) and is covered by a 10-year warranty. That’s better than the warranty coverage of the other desks I tested, some of which had only a two- to five-year warranty. The Branch Duo has a dual-motor lift system that ran smoothly in my tests, even when the desk was ... [+] loaded by the maximum 275-pound weight capacity. Erica Puisis It took about 40 minutes to assemble the desk, and the components and hardware were clearly labeled so there wasn’t any guesswork when I installed the various screws using the included hex wrench. Compared to the other desks I assembled, the Branch Duo’s instructions were clear and simple. The process took a little longer than a few other desks, but it felt relatively fast and frustration-free. For a finishing touch, you can outfit the desk with a cable management tray to keep cords from your computer or electronics organized and out of sight, or with a desk drawer for office essentials like pens, USB devices and sticky notes. Those accessories aren’t available for most of the other standing desks I tested, adding to the Branch Duo’s appeal for shoppers that want to customize their desk set-up. I’ve used the desk with both accessories and wouldn’t go without the cable management tray, which keeps the cords for the desk, my monitor and a phone charger tucked up but accessible. And while I was initially very excited to use the desk drawer and gave it high marks for build quality and a soft, felt-lined interior, I didn’t love the extra depth it takes up below the desk surface and ended up removing it. Opting to add it on to your desk will ultimately depend on how much you prioritize the extra storage space. Best Standing Desk Runner-Up Designed To Look Good And Last For Years Herman Miller Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk Dimensions: 48 x 27 inches, 60 x 27 inches, 72 x 30 inches | Height Range: 25.5 inches (minimum); 51 inches (maximum) | Memory Settings: 4 | Motor: Dual | Weight Capacity: 350 pounds | Warranty: 5 years (desktop); 15 years (frame, mechanical parts, motors, and electrical components) Best for: An alternative to laminate desktops A wide range of height settings Skip if: Having a variety of finish options is important You’re looking for a budget-friendly option The Fully Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk impressed me during testing with its strength and durability, and it has a classic aesthetic that will blend into most workspaces. The bamboo desktop is a sustainable, natural alternative to laminate surfaces, and you can pair it with a silver, black or white metal frame. Aside from an option for a curved desktop, there’s not much room for customizing the appearance of the Fully Jarvis desk. Its warranty, however, stands out: it’s five years for the desktop and 15 years for the other major components, which is second only to the Uplift V2 (which covers all components for 15 years). The Fully Jarvis has a bamboo surface, a more sustainable alternative to laminate. Erica Puisis When standing or sitting at this bamboo desk, I had no complaints about the form or function. The desk smoothly transitions from seated to standing and back using the up/down toggle buttons or four memory presets on the programmable keyset, which has a crisp OLED display that makes the numbers easy to read. The desk has a 350-pound weight capacity (about the same as other full-size standing desks) and had no noticeable wobble when I propped my elbows on the desk during use. It easily lifted 200 pounds during testing, without any slowdown or protest from the motor so it’s safe to say that it can handle even dual-monitor computer set-ups and plenty of paperwork. It also didn’t scratch or stain when I used the desk with a laptop stand, dropped a container full of pens on the desk’s surface, or spilled a cup of hot coffee. Best Splurge Standing Desk Sleek, Durable And Easy To Assemble Steelcase Steelcase Solo Sit-to-Stand Desk Dimensions: 48 x 24 inches, 60 x 24 inches, 48 x 30 inches, 60 x 30 inches| Height Range: 22.6 inches (minimum); 48.7 inches (maximum) | Memory Settings: None | Motor: Single | Weight Capacity: 360 pounds | Warranty: 12 years Best for: A wide range of height adjustments Fast assembly Simple, easy-to-use controller Skip if: You can’t live without memory height adjustments The Steelcase Solo Sit-To-Stand Desk is a worthy upgrade because it has a sleek aesthetic, feels incredibly sturdy and offers the easiest assembly of any standing desk I tested. While there’s much to say about the features that justify its high price-tag, the bottom line is that this model continues to perform well after six months of testing and would make a great choice for any office or home environment. The Solo Standing Desk made a terrific first impression with its lightning-fast assembly. While other desks required at least a handful of screws and bolts and took an hour (or more) to put together, Steelcase has streamlined assembly to two simple steps: snap the legs, which are already attached, into the frame and use a screwdriver to attach the paddle controller. The whole process was done in 10 minutes flat. Once assembled, the desk is light enough for two people to easily lift it. I’ve moved it around several times to accommodate my home office needs. The Steelcase Solo Sit-To-Stand Desk was the easiest to assemble of any desk I tested. Erica Puisis Belying its simple assembly, the desk is excellently constructed. The desktop is commercial-grade, high-pressure laminate that is more impact- and scratch-resistant than other types of laminate surfaces and shows absolutely no wear after six months’ of use. It comes in seven different finish options, and the steel frame is available in black or white. Its biggest limitation is that it’s only available with a paddle controller, not a programmable handset, so there’s no option for saving your preferred sitting or standing height. That said, I noticed that height adjustments are smooth and quiet, even when the desk was loaded up with 200 pounds—an impressive feat for a single-motor standing desk. The Solo Standing Desk is backed by a 12-year warranty, so it should hold up to years of use in a commercial office environment. Aesthetically, it fit right into my home office without looking clunky or industrial. Best Customizable Standing Desk A Desk With Many Size Options and Accessories Uplift Uplift V2 Standing Desk Dimensions: 42 x 30 inches, 48 x 30 inches, 60 x 30 inches, 72 x 30 inches, 80 x 30 inches | Height Range: 25.3 inches (minimum); 50.9 inches (maximum) | Memory Settings: 4 | Motor: Dual | Weight Capacity: 355 pounds | Warranty: 15 years Best for: A wide range of sizes and finishes Organizational add-ons and accessories, including a hammock Free returns within 30 days Skip if: You need an easy-to-assemble option Your space requires a desk that’s 24 inches deep All of the best standing desks offer at least a few options for customizing its size and appearance, but no standing desk offers as many finishes, features and accessories as the Uplift V2 Standing Desk. It’s hands-down the most customizable standing desk I tested, and it’s worth the effort to pick out and assemble this desk if you want one you can tailor to your needs and workspace. You can order the V2 Standing Desk in five different sizes, four different frame colors and more than 30 different finishes, including laminate, bamboo and solid wood options. While the starting price of this desk sits in the middle compared to others I tested, the price does climb if you select one of the larger sizes or a solid wood desktop. You can also get this desk in certain colors and sizes from Amazon. The Uplift V2's programmable controller is easy to use, with four preset heights and a digital ... [+] display. Erica Puisis Uplift’s wide range of add-ons makes the V2 ideal for customizing for your work or hobbies. You can pick from accessories like cable organizers, drawers, a storage cubby or a foot hammock or full-size hammock (only available for 72-inch desks or larger). Uplift adds some free accessories to your order, too, like a balance board for more comfort and movement while standing at the desk. Another standout optional accessory is the Bluetooth USB adaptor, which I found to be helpful for controlling the desk’s height and receiving sit or stand reminders. The programmable controller is also simple to use, with four preset heights and a digital display. The Uplift V2 comes with the widest range of add-on accessories among the desks I tested, including ... [+] an under-desk hammock. Erica Puisis Uplift has a generous 15-year warranty for the V2 Standing Desk and a 30-day return window with free shipping, beating most other brands, which deduct the cost of return shipping from your refund. I found their customer service to be very helpful when the first rubberwood desktop I ordered arrived with a gouge. Uplift was quick to make things right by shipping a new desktop promptly, which arrived in perfect shape. The biggest hang-up I encountered was the lengthy assembly time. It took almost two hours because of the many steps to assemble the frame and secure it to the legs and tabletop. If you don’t mind investing a little time upfront, this standing desk may be just right for whatever your workday routine involves (including power naps in your personal hammock). Best Standing Desk for Small Spaces Compact And Easy To Assemble Amazon Seville Classics Airlift Electric Height Adjustable Desk with Tempered Glass Top Dimensions: 47.5 x 24 inches | Height Range: 28 inches (minimum); 46.5 inches (maximum) | Memory Settings: 3 | Motor: Single | Weight Capacity: 176 pounds | Warranty: 2 years (electronic components); 7 years (non-electric components) Best for: Simple assembly A glass top that doubles as whiteboard Storing small office supplies in single, built-in drawer Skip if: You want customization options A larger desk with a higher weight limit is important The Seville Classics Airlift Electric Standing Desk impressed me with its slim, compact footprint, unique glass desktop and easy assembly. It’s one of the smaller options I tested, so I recommend this desk to anyone who has limited square footage in their home office. This modern-looking standing desk isn’t the most customizable option: It’s only available in a 47.5 x 24-inch size in white or black. It has a total weight capacity of 176 pounds, which is the lowest manufacturer-provided weight limit of any desk I tested. But the desk functioned just fine with 150 pounds of weight loaded onto its surface in my tests, so your average home office set-up should be fine on this desk. The Seville Classics AirLift desk is great for small spaces, and it's easy to assemble. Erica Puisis One thing that impressed me was its single-box packaging for ease of assembly. Most other standing desks arrive in at least two boxes (one for the desktop and frame and one for the legs), and those boxes don’t always arrive together. The Seville Classics Airlift Electric Standing Desk arrives in one box and is easy enough to set up in just 15 minutes. Adding to this desk’s aptitude for small spaces is that its contemporary-looking glass top doubles as a whiteboard for brainstorming, note-taking or making to-do lists. A center drawer glides out to hold your small office supplies, like pens and sticky notes. While you have to buy a drawer as an add-on for some other standing desks, this feature is integrated into the Airlift’s desktop. Best Budget Standing Desk An Affordable Pick With Extra Storage Amazon Fezibo Height Adjustable Electric Standing Desk Dimensions: 40 x 24 inches, 48 x 24 inches, 55 x 24 inches, 60 x 24 inches| Height Range: 27.5 inches (minimum); 46.9inches (maximum) | Memory Settings: 3 | Motor: Single | Weight Capacity: 176 pounds | Warranty: 2 years (motor and electronic components); 5 years (non-electric components) Best for: Organizing small office supplies A two-tier desk that elevates your monitor Skip if: You’re worried about hitting anything under the desk when it lowers You need a desk with a large workspace While you shouldn’t compromise on stability and function in a standing desk, you don’t have to start with the top-end model, either. The Fezibo Height Adjustable Electric Standing Desk is worth considering as an affordable, basic standing desk. It’s not the most robust standing desk I tested, as reflected in its 176-pound weight capacity and spliced desktop, which creates a seam in the middle of the desk. (The seam is mainly concealed by two storage drawers, but you might have to be judicious about how and where you load weight on the desk compared to a solid desktop.) The two-tier surface gives great elevation for a computer monitor and makes room for a storage cubby between the drawers. It does, however, limit the workspace directly in front of you, so keep that in mind if you frequently spread out a pile of papers or files as you work. The Fezibo has a programmable touch controller, which is a great feature to get at the under-$300 ... [+] price point. Erica Puisis While it was the cheapest standing desk I tested (outside of the SIDUCAL Small Adjustable Standing Desk with Wheels), the Fezibo Adjustable Height Standing Desk is also easy to adjust to sitting and standing heights using the programmable touch controller, which is a welcome bonus at the under-$300 price point. I also didn’t have any issues with the desktop’s durability or finish during testing; the desk lifted 150 pounds and a coffee spill didn’t stain the light maple surface. For average home use, this budget standing desk should do the trick. Just keep in mind that it lacks sensors or anti-collision technology, so keep chairs, filing cabinets and other objects out of the way when lowering the desk. MORE FROMFORBES VETTED The 10 Best Lip Stains That Stay Vibrant All Day By Tina Chadha Contributor The Best Maternity Dresses To Suit Every Trimester And Occasion By Lex Goodman Contributor Other Standing Desks I Tested In addition to the six winning standing desks, I tested three other models that didn’t make the cut. Flexispot E7 Pro ($599+): There are multiple Flexispot standing desk models to choose from, and I tested the brand’s E7 Pro with a handsome dark bamboo top, picked from a plethora of desktop options that include solid wood, chipboard and fiberboard (MDF). The desktop and frame feel solid but assembly was a real let-down. The pre-drilled holes in the desktop and included directions didn’t match up with the frame. When I reached out to Flexispot’s customer service, they advised me to use a drill to create holes that line up with the supplied frame, which I didn’t have to do for any other standing desk I tested. For the price, the desk should be simpler to assemble with less frustration and better directions. Vari Electric Standing ($850): The Vari Electric Standing Desk’s desktop and frame have a sturdy feel, but this was one of the only desks to sustain a few light scratches during testing. Overall, the desk felt well-built, the soft-touch keypad was easy to use, and I had no functional complaints about the desk’s height settings or adjustability. It just didn’t do enough to justify its price tag or distinguish itself from similar options. SIDUCAL Small Adjustable Standing Desk with Wheels ($100): This is a compact, wheeled option for a standing desk. It was the smallest standing desk I tested, but its two-tier design gave me enough room to comfortably fit my laptop stand, wireless keyboard, mouse and a few office supplies. In the end, though, the manual adjustments for the height settings deterred me from changing positions, especially since both sides of the desk require individual adjustment. More than once I ended up with a slanted desktop that required fine-tuning. How I Tested The Best Standing Desks To find the best standing desks for working from home and furnishing an office, I tested nine popular models in my home office. Since set-up can be cumbersome, my first evaluation was based on ease of assembly. After set-up, I used each desk for two workdays, alternating between standing and sitting positions. I paid attention to factors like how convenient it was to raise or lower the desk using the controller, and whether or not the desk includes obstruction sensors to avoid colliding with my chair. And while aesthetics are subjective, I noted the quality of materials and appearance. I also considered whether the materials made the desk feel like a good value for the price and if the desk was durable when loaded to its weight limit or in the face of office hazards, like spilled liquids or sharp objects. I tested 9 standing desks to find the best by assembling them, raising and lowering their heights ... [+] and doing weight and stain tests. Erica Puisis For the last six months, I’ve continued to rotate my working time between the Branch Duo Standing Desk and the Steelcase Solo Sit-To-Stand Desk, making observations about functionality and durability and looking out for signs of controller malfunction or motor issues. I tested for stains by spilling coffee on each desk's surface. Erica Puisis Throughout testing, I’ve taken note of any interactions I’ve had with customer service and evaluated the company for its speed of response and ability to answer questions and resolve issues. How To Pick A Standing Desk Buying a standing desk is an investment, and sometimes it helps to ease your way into this mode of work. Ergonomist Matt Jeffs, a doctor of physical therapy and ergonomics educator at Ability on Demand, says, “Starting out, you needn’t spend a fortune. Nor should you. There’s an undeniable period of conditioning that has to be accommodated.” Choosing a standing desk will depend on the function and form you need: size, height range, finish options and more. Here’s what to consider. Size According to my research, the most popular sizes for a standing desk are 48 x 24 inches and 60 x 30 inches. The most compact standing desks may be as small as 36 x 24 inches, and larger workstations can be as large as 72 x 30 inches or more. To pick the right size, identify how much space you need for your computer set-up and other work materials. You’ll also want to consider whether you need room for everyday items like mugs or water bottles. Design ecologist Lindsay Tan makes this suggestion: “Before you purchase any desk, do a full inventory of all your desktop peripherals, office supplies and workspaces needed for daily tasks. Map out the surface area of the new desk, then map out the devices, supplies and workspace to make sure the desk is wide enough and deep enough.” Height Settings The purpose of a sit-to-stand desk is to offer adjustable height settings, unlike a conventional desk with a fixed height. But not all standing desks have the same height range. Shorter or taller people may require a wider range of height settings. So to find the best standing desk for you, start by identifying your ideal seated height and standing height and then pick a desk that accommodates those. Tan provides this guidance on measuring your standing and seated height: “Standing with arms at your sides, bend your elbow like you would while typing and have someone measure the distance from your elbow to the floor (with your work shoes on). Make sure the desk adjusts to at least that height or taller. You can repeat that measurement process while sitting in your regular work chair to find the full range you’ll need.” Controller Most standing desks use an electric motor to do the heavy lifting of raising and lowering the desktop, although manual options with a hand crank are available, too. Electric standing desks come with different options for the controller, with the most basic being a paddle controller that you press up or push down to raise and lower the desk. I found a keypad controller with push buttons is the most common option. Often, the controller is programmable, which means it has a digital display that shows you the height setting and memory buttons to store your preferred standing and sitting heights. The advantage of a programmable controller is one-touch convenience. When you adjust from sitting to standing or vice versa, you simply push your stored height setting, and the desk automatically raises or lowers—rather than making you manually adjust the desk and fine tune the position each time. This also comes in handy if you share the desk; two users can each save one or two height settings (depending on how many memory settings are available). Accessories Accessories aren’t essential for a standing desk, but they can make it more convenient. One of the most common accessories is a cable management tray, which keeps the desk cord, computer cables and any other power cords tidy and tucked close to the underside of the desktop, rather than hanging down in a twisted jumble. Other accessories, like add-on drawers or storage cubbies, can help to organize your files or office essentials. Power accessories, like desktop grommets with a built-in outlet or a power strip that mounts to the desk, can also help keep your laptop, speakers, phone and other digital devices charged up and ready for use. It can simplify the number of wall outlets you need for your work set-up, since these accessories draw from the power supply of a plugged-in standing desk. Single-Motor Versus Dual-Motor Motorized standing desks are powered by one or two electrical motors. A dual-motor standing desk has a motor supplying power to each leg of the desk and will usually raise and lower more quickly than a single-motor model. Often, dual-motor standing desks have a higher weight capacity than single-motor options. Practically speaking, however, you’re unlikely to notice a dramatic difference in performance between a single-motor and a dual-motor standing desk unless you have a lot of equipment on the surface of the desk or you really need to raise and lower the desk in a hurry. My Expertise I’m a product reviewer and writer with six years’ experience covering appliances and home goods. My work has appeared on The Spruce, MyDomaine and U.S. News and World Report. During my time as a writer, I’ve always worked from home. As a result, I’ve used everything from a kitchen table to a music stand as a desk (I don’t recommend the latter). In the past, I used a manual standing desk but found the process of raising and lowering the desk to be cumbersome. After testing standing desks and standing desk converters, I’m a definite convert to the electric standing desk set-up. In addition to hours spent conducting research on the best standing desks, I consulted with three experts for their perspectives on ergonomics and office set-ups. Lindsay Tan, a design ecologist and the design director at West Second Street LLC, offered tips on how to identify what size desk you need and how to find the right height for your stature. Matt Jeffs, a doctor of physical therapy and an ergonomics educator at Ability on Demand, provided practical advice on how to balance your time sitting versus standing and how much to invest in a standing desk. Physiotherapist Lalitha Bhowani-McSorley of Brentwood Physiotherapy Calgary elaborated on the benefits of a standing desk for the musculoskeletal system and the risks of prolonged sitting. How Often Should I Change Positions With A Standing Desk? I asked several experts this same question and received a similar response from each one: Listen to your body. Jeffs says the question of when to sit and when to stand can be answered with this simple advice: “‘Listen to your fanny—and listen to your feet.’ That is, when your fanny tells you it’s had enough sitting, stand up. When your feet tell you they’ve had enough standing, sit down.” But if you really need some quantitative guidance, Jeffs cites a study conducted by Cornell University that recommended a ratio of 20:8:2. “For every half-hour working, 20 minutes can be spent sitting, 8 minutes should be spent standing, and 2 minutes should be spent moving,” explains Jeffs. “This was great research, with some limited application in vivo, mainly due to the awkward nature of setting a timer on a constantly revolving 20:8:2 schedule each and every half hour during a typical workday.” The main takeaway is to rotate your working position regularly and use this ratio as a guide more than a rule. How Much Does A Standing Desk Adjust? Standing desks vary in their minimum and maximum height settings, but I found that most models have a minimum height of around 28 inches and a maximum height of around 48 inches, for a total travel distance of about 20 inches (give or take a few inches, depending on the specific limitations of the model you choose). Be sure to measure your ideal sitting and standing height to ensure that the desk can accommodate both positions comfortably. How Long Will A Standing Desk Last? Frequency of use is likely to be the biggest factor in how long a standing desk will last, especially for the motor and electronic components. Some manufacturers specify their testing protocol for the standing desk, citing how many test cycles the desk has been proven to withstand. But perhaps the largest indicator of how long a standing desk will last is the length of the manufacturer's warranty. Keep in mind that some desks have separate warranty periods for different groups of parts and components, like the desktop, frame, motor and electrical components. The warranty periods of the desks I tested ranged from as short as a year or two to as long as 15 years. How Much Does A Standing Desk Cost? Based on my research, I found that standing desks generally cost between $250 and $1,000, with some very high-end models that cost as much as $3,000. Manual sit-to-stand desks cost the least (sometimes even less than $100), but motorized standing desks dominate the market because of their ease of use. Among motorized standing desks that cost between $250 and $1,000, the more common attributes include: anti-collision technology (this keeps the desk from crushing objects underneath it), preprogrammed height settings and integrated cord management. Laminate tops are the norm, but more expensive models may offer real wood as an option. How Can I Make a Standing Desk More Comfortable to Use? Your body will need to acclimate to using a standing desk. You can make the transition more comfortable with these helpful suggestions from physiotherapist Bhowani-McSorley. “An anti-fatigue mat can help reduce discomfort felt with prolonged standing by providing cushioning and encouraging subtle movements of the leg muscles,” she says. During testing, I also found that a balance board can help to prevent a stiff, rigid standing position that increases fatigue. And while much of the focus is on making the act of standing more comfortable, Bhowani-McSorley emphasizes the need to keep a neutral neck and spine position: “A monitor or laptop stand should be used to position the screen at eye level.” When it is time to sit, don’t forget to use an ergonomic chair or stool, picking an option that supports a slightly tilted pelvis can be beneficial for short periods of sitting, according to Bhowani-McSorley.",

                    "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin If your household regularly eats buttered toast, frozen waffles or bagels with cream cheese, a reliable toaster is a must-have. And if your household is on the larger side—or you simply want the option to toast more than two slices of bread at once—a 4-slice toaster, which offers twice the capacity of a standard model, is your best bet. After testing 15 of the best 4-slice toasters over the course of a month, I believe the Oster 4-Slice Touchscreen Toaster is the top option for most people. Not only is its sleek and modern interface easy to use, but it produces consistent browning results, whether you’re heating up breakfast pastries or bread for sandwiches. The best 4-slice toasters are sleek, user-friendly and consistent. Illustration: Forbes / Image: Retailers Here are all the winners from my testing process: Best 4-Slice Toaster Overall: Oster 4-Slice Touchscreen Toaster Best Splurge 4-Slice Toaster: Zwilling Enfinigy 4-Slice Toaster Best Value 4-Slice Toaster: Proctor Silex Wide Slot 4-Slice Toaster Best 4-Slice Toaster For Bagels: Buydeem Retro 4-Slice Metal Toaster Best 4-Slice Toaster For Waffles: Cuisinart 4-Slice Touchscreen Toaster Best Compact 4-Slice Toaster: Elite Gourmet 4-Slice Stainless Steel Long Toaster If you’re ready to splurge on a 4-slice toaster, I highly recommend the Zwilling Enfinigy 4-Slot Toaster, a sleek and dependable model with conveniently located crumb trays. For those on a budget, consider the no-frills Proctor Silex Wide Slot 4-Slice Toaster, which gets the job done. Meanwhile, some models excel at reheating or toasting specific foods. For example, bagel fans would be happiest with the Buydeem Retro 4-Slice Metal Toaster, while the Cuisinart 4-Slice Touchscreen Toaster would be the number-one option for those who eat frozen waffles every morning. Lastly, if you’re short on countertop space, the compact Elite Gourmet 4-Slice Stainless Steel Long Toaster is your best bet. Ahead, I break down each model’s greatest (and not so greatest) features, based on their performance across my culinary tests. Best 4-Slice Toaster Overall A Dependable Pick With An Easy-To-Use Touchscreen Amazon Oster 4-Slice Touchscreen Toaster Our score: 8/10 | Dimensions: 11.4 x 10.8 x 7.2 inches | Weight: 6.3 pounds | Temperature settings: 6 | Functions: Bagel, reheat, frozen Best for: Home cooks who want to customize their perfect slice Home cooks who value the aesthetics of a sleek, modern touchscreen Home cooks who want to spend under $100 on a toaster Skip if: You’re short on space, as this toaster is large Following a month of rigorous testing, the Oster 4-Slice Touchscreen Toaster proved to be the most impressive model overall. With six shade settings and three additional presets—bagel, frozen and reheat—this 4-slice toaster makes it easy to customize your perfect slice. It also produces consistent browning results, all for less than $100. Using the responsive touchscreen, which I found to be user-friendly, I prepared toast, bagels, frozen waffles and Pop-Tarts. Starting with white sandwich bread, I toasted slices using three shade settings: 2, 4 and 6. The middle setting yielded evenly golden brown toast with uniform color on both sides of the slice in two minutes and 50 seconds. The highest possible setting, by comparison, produced nearly burnt toast—but it was still slightly soft to the touch. Whereas most other toasters I tested produced rock-hard blackened slices on the highest setting, Oster’s were still edible—a plus for those who like their toast on the darker side. Toast made in the Oster model. Kelly Vaughan For Forbes The model’s performance remained strong with other foods. When I toasted bagels on shade setting 3 (with the bagel preset selected), the bagel came out warm and perfectly toasted after two minutes and 25 seconds. (During this test, I appreciated the model’s extra-wide slots, which comfortably accommodate large New York City–style bagels.) Frozen waffles, too, popped out feeling crispy with very light browning, while the Pop-Tarts it made were fully warmed through with little browning. My only issue with this toaster is the location of the crumb trays, which are in the back of the machine. Front- and side-facing crumb trays, by comparison, are easier to empty. That said, I didn’t find this toaster difficult to clean, and overall, I appreciated its design. Best Splurge 4-Slice Toaster A Luxe Model With Smart Finishes Zwilling Zwilling Enfinigy 4-Slice Toaster Our score: 9/10 | Dimensions: 11.5 x 11.3 x 8.1 inches | Weight: 8.4 pounds | Temperature settings: 7 | Functions: Bagel, defrost, reheat Best for: Home cooks who like the look of a subtle, sleek design Home cooks who value the dependability of a high-end brand like Zwilling Home cooks who want a consistent and dependable toaster Skip if: You love to toast bagels, as this model fell short If you prefer the look, feel and performance of high-end appliances, the Zwilling Enfinigy 4-Slice Toaster is a sleek, easy-to-use powerhouse fit for larger households. While its overall build is slightly bulky, it’s nonetheless attractive, with its modern white and silver finish and minimalist buttons. It also—unlike many models out there—has crumb trays in the front for easy access and cleaning. And in the opinion of Adam Goldberg, founder and CEO of PopUp Bagels, “the ability to clean the bottom and get the crumbs out easily” is invaluable. As for its performance, this toaster leaves little to be desired. Featuring seven shade settings and added presets including bagel, defrost and reheat, this toaster yielded uniformly brown pieces of toast on various settings, frozen waffles that came out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and warmed-through Pop-Tarts. With bagels, though, the toaster never got them fully crispy—even on higher settings. This wasn’t a major drawback, though, especially considering the rest of the toaster’s strengths. Best Value 4-Slice Toaster A Basic Pick At A Wallet-Friendly Price Amazon Proctor Silex Wide Slot 4-Slice Toaster Our score: 7/10 | Dimensions: 10.5 x 11 x 7.5 inches | Weight: 4.1 pounds | Temperature settings: 7 | Functions: None Best for: Home cooks on a budget College students and first-time apartment dwellers with limited space Anyone who wants a no-frills model Skip if: You prefer a toaster with more customizable features If you’re in the market for a no-frills, petite 4-slice toaster, this model from Proctor Silex is a reliable pick. Though it’s not exactly sleek (it has a white or black plastic exterior and generally feels budget), it delivers good results for the price. Equipped with seven shade settings (and no additional functions), this model produced consistently brown toast, crispy but soft-centered frozen waffles and golden Pop-Tarts. While it also yielded pleasantly warm and crispy bagels, it’s worth noting that they came out toasted on both sides, as this toaster doesn’t have a bagel preset. Lastly, like the Oster model, this toaster also features two crumb trays located in the back of the toaster, which makes them more difficult to access. For the price, though, I think you’d be hard-pressed to find a better budget-friendly pick. Best 4-Slice Toaster For Bagels A Retro-Style Option That Excels At Toasting Sliced Bagels Amazon Buydeem Retro 4-Slice Metal Toaster Our score: 8/10 | Dimensions: 7 x 12.2 x 11 inches | Weight: 5.1 pounds | Temperature settings: 7 | Functions: Bagel/muffin, defrost, reheat Best for: Toasting bagels, thanks to its extra-wide slots and great results Design lovers who appreciate a range of colorful options Home cooks who want an all-around dependable toaster Skip if: You’re looking for a toaster that excels at toasting different food products Despite being an Amazon bestseller, I didn’t have the highest of hopes at first for this stainless steel toaster, which looks like a knockoff Smeg model. But during testing, it far exceeded my expectations. While it made good toast, frozen waffles and Pop-Tarts, it excelled at toasting bagels. A bagel made in the Buydeem toaster. Kelly Vaughan For Forbes To start, the toaster is equipped with extra-wide slots and a bagel/muffin setting, the latter of which is especially important. “These settings prevent them from becoming excessively crunchy, ensuring they maintain the perfect balance of crispy outside and chewy inside,” says Melanie Frost, COO of Ess-a-Bagel. The Buydeem toaster also features a clear graphic on top so you know exactly which way to insert the sliced bagel for the best results. On shade setting 4, the bagel toasted in exactly three minutes and came out evenly brown and crispy. One more nice thing: If you’re a home cook who loves a pop of color in your kitchen, this model comes in pretty yellow and mint green hues. Best 4-Slice Toaster For Waffles A Reliable, User-Friendly Model That Delivers Delicious Waffles Amazon Cuisinart 4-Slice Touchscreen Toaster Our score: 8.5/10 | Dimensions: 10.4 x 11 x 7.2 inches | Weight: 7.4 pounds | Temperature settings: 6 | Functions: +30 seconds, bagel, single slice, defrost Best for: Anyone who likes to start their morning with frozen waffles Those who want to invest in a tried-and-true brand like Cuisinart Those drawn to higher-tech appliances Skip if: You don’t care for a modern touchscreen interface If you’re more of a frozen waffle person than a bagel person, this Cuisinart made the absolute best out of the bunch during testing. Using shade setting 3 plus the defrost feature, the waffles came out perfectly warm, consistently brown and crispy on the outside in just under two minutes. Waffles made in the Cuisinart 4-Slice Touchscreen Toaster. Kelly Vaughan For Forbes While this model really shone during the waffle test, it’s not a one-trick pony. For instance, it produced Pop-Tarts that were warm and mildly browned, as well as lightly crispy bagels. Its overall design is nice, too: The control panel is a touchscreen, which I found user-friendly. The toaster also has a “+30 seconds” button if your food needs just a little more time to brown, which isn’t a common setting. The only test that left me disappointed? Toasted bread. While one side of the sandwich bread came out with even coloring, the other side was always significantly darker. Best Compact 4-Slice Toaster A Slim, Inexpensive Pick That’s Ideal For Small Spaces Amazon Elite Gourmet 4-Slice Stainless Steel Long Toaster Our score: 8.5/10 | Dimensions: 7.1 x 14.7 x 7.7 inches | Weight: 5.7 pounds | Temperature settings: 6 | Functions: Defrost, reheat Best for: College students, apartment dwellers and anyone who has a small kitchen Home cooks on a budget Those drawn to compact, streamlined appliances Skip if: You want a toaster that has a few more features, such as a bagel setting Featuring a slim, lightweight design, the Elite Gourmet 4-Slice Stainless Steel Long Toaster is the model for those with little countertop space to spare. In addition to six shade settings, the toaster has buttons for defrosting and reheating, and it’s brilliantly designed with a crumb tray located on the left side for easy access and cleaning. During testing, this toaster yielded evenly brown and crisp bagels, and it managed to keep sliced bread slightly soft while delivering golden color. It underwhelmed me only when I used it to make frozen waffles, which popped out looking pale yellow and still soft on a midrange shade setting with defrost mode activated. Still, this toaster is up for most tasks, and its compact build makes it great for smaller kitchens. One more nice perk: It’s equipped with a pop-up rack to warm up items that wouldn’t fit in the slots, like croissants or halved baguettes. MORE FROMFORBES VETTED The 10 Best Lip Stains That Stay Vibrant All Day By Tina Chadha Contributor The Best Maternity Dresses To Suit Every Trimester And Occasion By Lex Goodman Contributor Other 4-Slice Toasters I Tested In addition to the six toasters listed above, I also tested nine other popular 4-slice toasters, ranging in price from $30 to $480. Here’s how they stacked up against the winners: All-Clad Digital Stainless Steel 4-Slice Toaster (3.5/10): From the beeping noise it makes just before releasing the toasted bread to its four smart settings including reheat, defrost, bagel, and more time, there’s a lot to like about this toaster from a design perspective. However, the performance didn’t measure up. Bagels, which were toasted on a midrange setting, came out cold, soft and unevenly browned; ditto for frozen waffles, which lacked consistent browning. Plus, its shiny stainless steel finish highlights each and every fingerprint. Breville “A Bit More” Toaster (6.5/10): I really wanted to recommend this model—it’s well designed, never got warm to the touch and delivered perfectly toasted frozen waffles. However, it ran quite hot, and, given there are only five shade settings to choose from, I found it difficult to determine the best setting for my desired results. What’s more, it started smoking when I tried to toast a slice of bread on the highest setting. Breville Die-Cast 4-Slice Smart Toaster (6.5/10): This model is nearly identical in performance to the brand’s “A Bit More” version—except that it’s designed like a traditional 4-slot toaster. Like the aforementioned model, this one also smoked heavily on the highest setting and produced rock-hard, completely black toast. Cuisinart Four-Slice Motorized Toaster (6.5/10): Is there such a thing as having too much power? Yes. This toaster boasts a panel with so many customizable features that it quickly becomes confusing. With seven different browning shades and six different bread types (you can even distinguish between white and whole-wheat bread), I could see how some users may like having every option under the sun. But at the end of the day, there are many other toasters that offer nearly as many features and are much easier to understand. Hamilton Beach 4-Slice Toaster With Extra Wide Slots (4.5/10): This toaster felt cheaply constructed and ran hot, delivering inconsistent, too-dark slices of bread. While I was impressed with how evenly crisp the bagels appeared after toasting for under three minutes, the brand is overselling its extra-wide slots, which felt snug. KitchenAid 4-Slice Toaster With Manual High-Lift Lever (4/10): This KitchenAid toaster is poorly designed and struggles to perform against comparable models. While it features a handy beeping noise that sounds just before the food pops up, it’s loud and alarming. It also required nearly Herculean effort to push the levers down and lock them into place when toasting everything from sliced bread to Pop-Tarts. Krups 4-Slice Stainless Steel Toaster (7/10): While this 4-slice toaster from Krups performed well for toasting Pop-Tarts, it didn’t deliver on bagels and frozen waffles. When testing bagels, I used a middle setting (3 out of 6) and selected the bagel feature; after two minutes and 20 seconds, the cut side was still pale, and the exterior was completely soft. Smeg 4x4 4-Slice Toaster (4.5/10): This toaster runs quite hot. (Similar to both Breville models, this Smeg toaster started smoking on settings 4 and 6.) When I tested Pop-Tarts on shade 2, the toaster pastries popped out warped and quite dark for such a low setting. While the model is certainly pretty, I found it to be unreliable. Wolf Gourmet 4-Slice Toaster (5/10): At nearly $500, this was, by far, the most expensive toaster I tested. However, there was nothing about this toaster that made it significantly better than others that were half the price. While I appreciated some of its design choices—namely, the extra-wide slots and crumb trays located on the right and left sides of the toaster—I don’t think they justified the price. Additionally, Wolf advises against heating up toaster pastries of any kind in this toaster, making this model less versatile. There are two popular toasters that I excluded from testing: the Revolution InstaGlo R270 Toaster and the Smeg 4-Slice Toaster. My parents have owned the former for over three years and have been disappointed since day one, owing to its inconsistent browning results. The latter is the model I’ve owned for the past two years and, while it’s certainly attractive, it tends to run cool and requires a higher setting than other toasters to achieve my desired brownness. Plus, when a slice of bread finishes toasting, it launches from the machine like a rocket, often landing on my countertop or, worse, in my kitchen sink. How I Tested The Best 4-Slice Toasters I started my search for the best 4-slice toasters by looking at a variety of brands at different price points on the market. I considered best-selling and top-rated models from trusted kitchen brands including All-Clad, Breville, Cuisinart, Hamilton Beach, KitchenAid, Smeg and Wolf Gourmet. That said, I also considered a few models from less-known brands that are popular on Amazon (or another retailer). I tested 15 toasters total and four different food products in each toaster: plain bagels, frozen waffles, white sandwich bread and frosted and unfrosted Pop-Tarts. During testing, I assessed each model’s overall design and materials, temperature settings and additional functions, speed of toasting and browning consistency, as well as the location of the crumb tray for easy cleaning. In each toaster, I toasted sliced white bread on three different settings to assess the consistency of browning, plus the efficiency. I toasted sliced bagels at least once per toaster—and in some cases, twice—assessing whether the bagels came out thoroughly warm, with one crispy and evenly brown side. With Pop-Tarts, I first warmed up the popular breakfast treat on the lowest setting, which was recommended by most manufacturers; then, I used a midrange setting to look for hot spots, warping and browning. When testing frozen waffles (with either a normal setting or a defrost setting, if the toaster had one), I assessed if they thoroughly defrosted and managed to stay soft and fluffy on the inside while getting crispy on the outside.

                    "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Like swim trunks and t-shirts, shorts are something you wear constantly in warm weather, so it’s important that they fit well. The best shorts for men sit comfortably on your waist, hit at a flattering length on your leg and are cut from breathable fabrics that keep you cool. For instance: Our top pick overall is the Bonobos Chino 2.0, which is made from high-quality stretch cotton and has a classic fit that works for most wearers. For casual days at the office, consider the Amazon Essentials Classic-Fit Cargo for under $25. We rounded up the best shorts for men that will keep you cool in warm weather. Illustration: Forbes / Photo: Retailers To find the top shorts for men, we evaluated several pairs from dozens of of well-loved brands.

This piece is the shorts version of the brand’s best-selling chino, which features a wrinkle-resistant, four-way stretch fabric in a classic flat-front style. (One reviewer says they’re so comfortable, he’s even slept in them.) Design details, like a curved waistband to reduce excess fabric and a hidden side pocket to stash your valuables, make these shorts a solid pick. They come in three fits—standard, slim and athletic—as well as three inseam lengths, so you can find a pair that fits perfectly. What the reviews say: Overall, customers are pleased with the quality of the shorts and the amount of color options. “They're tight on the thigh, but have an incredible amount of stretch—somehow these keep their shape while being so stretchy,” one reviewer writes. However, some customers feel the sizing is inconsistent and that the shorts aren’t as slim as the brand’s previous version. Best Work Shorts For Men J.Crew: Classic Fit In A Range Of Sizes And Lengths J.Crew J.Crew Stretch Chino Sizes: 28 to 42 | Inseam lengths: 5 inches, 7 inches, 9 inches, 10.5 inches | Colors: 9 total, including Khaki and Stone | Materials: 98% cotton, 2% elastane What you’ll love: Four inseam lengths Lightweight and breathable Keep in mind: Larger sizes sell out quickly J.Crew is great for classic wardrobe staples, its shorts included. This top-rated stretch version comes in four different inseam lengths—the 7-inch hits at that sweet spot between your knee and thigh—and has traditional four-pocket styling. Paired with a belt and a button-down shirt, these shorts are appropriate for a business-casual setting. If you do plan on wearing them to the office, we recommend sticking to the one of the longer inseam lengths. What the reviews say: Customers appreciate the fit and feel of these shorts. One reviewer describes them as “perfect lightweight and breathable summer/spring chino shorts,” noting that they “fit like a glove” after sizing down one size. However, a few reviewers say the material is thin and wrinkles easily.

One reviewer writes, “These are a great pair of shorts that you truly can wear everywhere. I feel great wearing them to school, the beach or the golf course.” Best Travel Shorts For Men Lululemon: Wrinkle-Resistant For Long-Haul Flights Lululemon Lululemon ABC Classic-Fit Short Sizes: 28 to 40 | Inseam lengths: 7 inches, 9 inches | Colors: 6 total, including Obsidian and Bone | Materials: 54% recycled polyester, 46% elastomultiester What you’ll love: Wrinkle-resistant fabric Streamlined fit Zippered seam pocket for travel essentials Keep in mind: Some customers note inconsistent sizing Like the rest of its activewear, Lululemon’s ABC shorts strike the right balance between style and function.

What the reviews say: This style earns high marks from customers for their excellent construction. “These shorts fit exactly how I hoped they would,” one reviewer says. “They don’t have much stretch to them, but I think that’s part of why the material feels high-quality.” On the other hand, some customers aren’t a huge fan of the fabric’s stiffness and prefer a stretchier fit. Best Golf Shorts For Men Peter Millar: Crisp And Clean For The Course MOST POPULAR Nordstrom Peter Millar Salem Short Sizes: 30 to 42 | Inseam lengths: 9 inches | Colors: 4 total, including Black and Stone | Materials: 100% polyester What you’ll love: Tailored fit Wrinkle-resistant Lightweight polyester fabric Keep in mind: Only available in one inseam length Earning the top spot on our list of the best golf shorts, Peter Millar’s Salem shorts have a clean, flat front and back darts to give a more tailored fit.

The lightweight, two-way stretch technical fabric allows for day-to-day comfort and wrinkle resistance, making these a great option for semi-formal outdoor events. What the reviews say: These shorts are popular among avid golfers, who appreciate their versatility. “I have four to five pairs of these shorts as they are my absolute favorites,” one reviewer writes. “Nice for the golf course, country club or just a casual outing.” However, some customers note that the shorts fit differently than the brand’s previous version of the style.

The reviewer also suggests sizing down for the right fit, based on the brand’s guidelines.

A zippered pocket in the back allows you to stash small essentials, while the stretchy loops on each side can hold a shirt if you take it off on your hike or run. What our editors say: Gear editor Cam Vigliotta describes the liner as “supportive and flexible.” It also naturally fights odor, thanks to the antimicrobial properties of merino wool. “If you're traveling or between washes, it's nice to know they don't hold onto odor whatsoever,” he adds.

These shorts are responsibly made and feature design details like a coin pocket and two button-through back pockets that store your stuff without looking too bulky. What the reviews say: Customers are happy with how this style fits, with one describing it as “slightly loose, but not baggy.” They also praise the quality of the smooth and comfortable fabric. Best Corduroy Shorts For Men Madewell: Cool Corduroy In Unique Hues Madewell Madewell Corduroy Everywear Sizes: XS to XXL | Inseam lengths: 5.5 inches | Colors: 6 total, including Warm Coffee and Dusty Laurel | Materials: 100% cotton What you’ll love: Soft, textured fabric Unique color options Keep in mind: No belt loops Inseam length may be too short for tall men These pull-on shorts are made of ultra-soft corduroy, which lends a unique texture to any warm-weather ensemble. They come in unconventional hues such as Warm Coffee, a rich reddish brown, and Distant Peri, a dusty lilac. The stretchy waistband eliminates the need for a belt loop, but you’ll still find traditional details like side pockets and a welt pocket in the back. What the reviews say: Customers are satisfied overall with the shorts’ fit and length. “I wear these both at home when just hanging out and when I go out with friends,” one customer writes. “They’re perfect with a casual T-shirt or a dressed shirt.” This customer also mentions that they work really well for big thighs, but a few other reviewers feel that the cut is too roomy for their tastes. MORE FROMFORBES VETTED The 10 Best Lip Stains That Stay Vibrant All Day By Tina Chadha Contributor The Best Maternity Dresses To Suit Every Trimester And Occasion By Lex Goodman Contributor Other Top Styles To Consider We understand that style preference is highly personal. In case our short selections above aren’t exactly what you’re looking for, we tapped Caldwell for four more fashion-forward picks he recommends to his clients. Laidback But Still Pulled Together Faherty Faherty Essential Drawstring Drawstring styles are easy-going and bridge the gap between polished and casual. “This has the look of a chino, but is more relaxed,” says Caldwell. “I would wear these with a hoodie or nice T-shirt and sneakers.” They come in nine shades, including Oakwood and Spring Olive. The OG of Workout Shorts Patagonia Patagonia Baggies Before there was Lululemon or Rhone, there was Patagonia. Often seen on outdoorsy types, these shorts have an old-school look that never goes out of style. “They dry quickly, keep you cool and just have a great classic look,” says Caldwell. Thanks to the built-in mesh liner, they double as swimwear, and they are made out of nylon faille from recycled fishing nets. A Fresh Take On The Chino Billy Reid Billy Reid Chino Short While Caldwell prefers his shorts a little shorter (not longer than 7 inches), he still loves these slim, flattering Billy Reid chino shorts with a perfectly respectable 8-inch inseam. They are well-made and durable; the pocket welts are reinforced with half-moon stitching, and the pocket openings and belt loops are secured with bar tacking. “They also have nice details, like horn buttons, and come in great colors like French Blue,” says Caldwell. Magnum PI-Style Shorts Amazon Birdwell Men's Classic Corduroy Shorts These are the closest thing you will find to the retro shorts that Tom Selleck wore back in the ‘80s. They have the same vintage front patch pockets, a button fly and a hidden drawstring that allows for a customized fit. This pair is handcut and handsewn in Los Angeles and comes in two classic colors. Forbes Vetted contributing fashion writer Lesley Rotchford owns a pair (there’s a women’s version, too), and Caldwell is a fan as well. “They’re fun and comfy,” he says. Why Trust Forbes Vetted At Forbes Vetted, we’ve published many expertly researched fashion articles, including a variety of menswear-specific topics, such as comfortable dress shoes and jeans for men. All picks were approved by Forbes Vetted deputy editor Kari Molvar, who has been covering fashion and lifestyle topics for more than 20 years and holds a certificate in fashion styling from the Business of Fashion. We spoke to men’s fashion stylist Bentley Caldwell for insight on what to look for when shopping for shorts, plus additional picks. We also tapped personal fashion stylist Josephine Eve to gain helpful knowledge on how to find the right inseam length for the perfect fit. We refresh this list regularly to ensure you’re up to date on product availability and sales. This article was recently updated in June 2024 by fashion writer Claire Epting, who added the Smartwool Active Lined Short to our roundup. How We Chose The Best Shorts For Men When selecting the best shorts for men, we sought out reputable brands who are known for making high-quality menswear staples, including Bonobos and J.Crew. We pored over dozens of customer reviews to learn more about how each pick lives up to expectations in real-life settings. We included key takeaways when possible to give you a well-rounded view of each product. We polled the Forbes Vetted team for their personal recommendations; audience development director Spencer Dukoff loves the Vuori Kore Short, while gear editor Cam Vigliotta vouches for the Smartwool Active Lined Short. Pricing was also taken into account; we made sure to include wallet-friendly options as well as luxury pieces. Our picks start at around the $25 mark and range in price up to $150. What To Consider When Shopping For Men’s Shorts There are a few factors to keep in mind when you’re searching for your next pair of shorts, including inseam length, material, fit and color. Here’s what to consider, according to Caldwell. Inseam Length Shorts are getting shorter these days, with the preferred inseam length for most guys being around 7 inches. Of course, taller men may need a 9-inch inseam, while shorter guys (or those who just prefer a shorter look) might want to choose shorts with a 5-inch or 6-inch inseam. “Basically, as a rule of thumb, shorts should hit an inch or two above the knee,” says Caldwell. Material Chino-type shorts are made of cotton or polyester with a touch of elastin or spandex for movement and comfort. Caldwell advises sticking to chino-type shorts for most scenarios, with one exception: If you plan on working out, opt for a performance fabric, typically made of polyester or polyamide with a higher percentage of spandex. Caldwell also likes linen for a relaxed, beachy look, but says you have to be willing to live with some wrinkles. Those looking to infuse their wardrobe with an interesting texture should consider corduroy as well. Fit “Always air on the side of slim,” says Caldwell. But slim doesn’t work for everyone, in every setting. Athletic guys with larger thighs might feel more comfortable in a classic fit (think “relaxed,” not “baggy”), and a classic fit may also feel more appropriate in conservative environments (like a country club or at work). Try a few different styles to see what feels best on you. Color Neutral shades, such as navy and khaki, are popular for a reason: They go with everything, and they’re appropriate for the office, as well as more casual weekend wear. However, don’t be afraid to switch it up with rich greens, browns and reds in more casual settings. “A pop of color, like French Blue, can also be nice,” says Caldwell. What Style Of Men’s Shorts Are Most Flattering? Finding the right short style for you has a lot to do with build and leg shape. If you have thicker thighs, consider a short with a wider leg opening; meanwhile, if your legs are more narrow, look for a short with a slimmer cut. While everyone has their own style preferences, a well-tailored chino short—like the Bonobos Chino 2.0—looks good on just about everyone. Designed with a straight leg, multiple inseam options and plenty of stretch, these versatile shorts accommodate a variety of builds and heights. Can I Wear Shorts To Work? Whether or not you can wear shorts to work depends entirely on where you work. “If your workplace environment is casual and relaxed and it is within the dress code that you can wear shorts to work, then go for it,” says personal fashion stylist Josephine Eve. Work at a law firm? You’re probably out of luck. “I think it can look unprofessional in a corporate office setting, especially if you are meeting clients—or you’re meeting with your boss,” Eve says. But a startup or more casual environment could be a great place to wear your shorts in. Opt for a longer length and a clean, sophisticated style, like the J.Crew Stretch Chino. What Is The Best Inseam Length For Men’s Shorts? Like pants, shorts are measured using the inseam, or the length from your crotch to the hem of the shorts. Common short lengths are 5, 7, 9 and 11 inches. Generally, your shorts should hit around 2 inches above the kneecap for the best fit. To find your ideal inseam length, Eve suggests measuring the distance from the inner crotch seam to the bottom hem. Start by grabbing a pair of shorts that fit you well and stand with your legs a bit apart. “Then with a measuring tape, place it at the very top of the inside seam. Let the tape drop all the way down to where you want your shorts to end,” she says.

                    "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The best baby walkers look a lot different than the walkers of the past. As your baby starts to take those first steps, many parents seek out certain toys with the good intention of helping Baby reach this big milestone. But pediatricians and pediatric physical therapists no longer recommend sit-in, wheeled baby walkers of yesteryear. In fact, the Academy of American Pediatrics (AAP) warns against the wheeled walkers, particularly because they can allow otherwise non-mobile babies to reach hazards in the home and to even fall down stairways, causing injury. All of that said, there are plenty of safe push toys, wagons, baby seats and engaging activity stations that serve as fabulously fun alternative baby walkers. Today’s best baby walkers are redesigned for safety and toddler ergonomics. Illustration: Forbes / Photos: Retailers Some research also suggested that sitting in those baby walkers might have slowed a baby’s walking development. Elizabeth Morel, owner of Little Movers PT, a pediatric physical therapy office in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, isn’t surprised by this. “Babies tend to lean to one side in the seat because they have poor core control,” she explains. “This usually coincides with the early in-utero preference, and it can lead to even more asymmetry over time,” she says, adding that sitting this way puts uneven pressure on babies’ underdeveloped hips. Morel says the best baby walker alternatives are activity tables and bouncers that don’t put pressure on baby’s core and lower body. As for push toys, they’re generally OK, too, says Victoria Regan M.D., a pediatrician at Children’s Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston. “Using a mobile push toy can be fun for children and is generally safe once they’re able to walk, usually between 9 and 15 months of age,” she says. “They should be used with parental supervision.” These best baby walkers and alternatives below meet our experts’ criteria. Best Baby Walker Alternative Overall: Haba Walker Wagon Best Value Baby Walker Alternative: Leapfrog Little Office Learning Center Best Splurge Baby Walker Alternative: Manhattan Toy Double Decker Celestial Star Explorer Best Wooden Baby Walker Alternative: Tender Leaf Toys Baby Block Walker Best Baby Walker Alternative Activity Table: Melissa & Doug First Play Jungle Activity Table Best Musical Baby Walker Alternative: Hape My First Musical Trotter Best Baby Walker Alternative With Extras: Melissa & Doug Shape Sorting Grocery Car Best Baby Walker Alternative Overall A Sturdy Walker Wagon Ideal For Pretend Play Amazon Haba Walker Wagon It isn’t cheap, but that’s part of what makes this Haba Walker Wagon so special and the best baby walker overall. Its quality craftsmanship extends to every aspect, ensuring the wooden toy operates smoothly. The rubber wheels are adjustable, allowing parents to control the speed of the walker for their individual child. It’s made of beechwood and birchwood and treated with water-based stain, so parents won’t worry about toxins. The best part is that this walker encourages open-ended play. There’s a little bench on the front of it to place a favorite doll or stuffed animal, and the back of the wagon can also be filled with toys. Reviewers praise its sturdiness and how much their kids love it—and it racks up the positive ratings at every retailer. It’s rated for ages 10 months and up, but parents should use their discretion based on their own child’s development. Best Value Baby Walker Alternative A Colorful Activity Table With Removable Busy Board Amazon Leapfrog Little Office Learning Center This C-suite may not have an executive chair, but it does have an interactive laptop (for learning shapes and animals), a phone (for practicing first words) and a globe that plays greetings and songs from around the world. We love that this activity table is fully bilingual in English and Spanish and arrives with the necessary batteries. It’s lightweight and affordable plastic. We also like its lower stature and that the top is removable, allowing parents to place it onto the floor as a busy board for tots who aren’t pulling up to stand just yet. It has a 4.7 out of 5 stars rating on Amazon from over 6,500 reviews. Best Splurge Baby Walker Alternative An Heirloom With Star Power Amazon Manhattan Toy Double Decker Celestial Star Explorer There’s room for up to four kids to blast off around this intricately detailed wooden activity center. The outer space themed toys include beads you push along wires, glider toys that move along the “floor,” a spring-loaded moon, a moving solar panel, doors to open and spinners to spin. It has a lot to capture the attention of older tots as well, so it’s great for a pair of siblings to share. Babies can play as soon as they’re a year old or can stand at it unassisted. It is heavy (14-plus pounds) but not meant to aid a child pulling up to stand. Best Wooden Baby Walker Alternative A Colorful Wagon With Room For Tons Of Toys Bloomingdales Tender Leaf Toys Baby Block Walker This old-school push toy is designed to be used by babies 18 months and older who are already walking. It meets another of Regan’s key criteria: giving little ones a clear view of where they’re headed. “Make sure the child can see and that the handle they will be using does not obstruct their view,” she advises. Some push toys have an activity board on front; they’re cute, but that can make it difficult to see obstacles that kids can bump into and trip over. This Tender Leaf Toys wagon is nice and low at 16 inches tall, with a low cargo bin and open handle frame. Kids appreciate the cheerful included block set, as well as using the wagon for playing pretend when they’re ready. Best Baby Walker Alternative Activity Table A Zoo Of Zany Toys For Even Small Babies Amazon Melissa & Doug First Play Jungle Activity Table This vivid wooden activity table is Morel’s pick as an alternative to baby walkers. Its jungle-themed toys include elephant gears to crank, a snake tube to spin, toucans shapes to slide, butterfly wings to open and shut, and a leopard to turn—all of which help refine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. Parents may also appreciate that it doesn’t make any noise or require batteries. Your child can start playing with it when they can sit supported in your lap. “That’s usually around 5 months or so,” Morel says. In general, if you’re looking for an activity table for a small baby, buy one that’s short—but not too short—so your baby can keep their back straight and chin level while reaching for the toys, she says. Best Musical Baby Walker Alternative Let The Tunes Flow While They Stroll Amazon Hape My First Musical Trotter This musical walker from Hape is ideal for the youngest walkers for a few reasons. It’s petite enough for younger tots, but it also has adjustable speed settings on the wheels, so parents can keep kids from cruising faster than their legs are ready to go. Let kids stroll with the music on or off, and they can play with the musical items, such as the drum and xylophone, as well as a few other toys like a mirror, even while sitting on the floor. The design is meant to prevent baby from tipping over with it, and the position of the handle makes it easy for baby to see where they’re going. Some reviewers have had trouble adjusting the speed and getting the music to work properly if they haven’t adjusted the bolts just so. Best Baby Walker Alternative With Extras This Wagon Includes A Fun Array Of Additional Toys Target Melissa & Doug Shape Sorting Grocery Car Kids have plenty to explore with this amenity-laden wooden cart from Melissa & Doug. It includes two chunky wooden puzzles, a shape-sorting game and a matching game. Of course, it also comes with a faux coffee cup, because your little one probably already knows you won’t make a grocery run without your caffeine. We love that this cart is likely to have some staying power as kids use it to run errands all over your house, toting their favorite toys from here to there in make-believe games for years to come.

Our team has extensive experience finding toys and gear that make life with little ones easier and more joyful—while also staying safe. The co-authors of this story are parents themselves and pros at reporting on products for children. Elyse Moody is a parent and professional product tester. Dahlia Rimmon M.S. is a mom of three kids under 5, and has used a push walker with her children once they became confident walkers. Rimmon writes for several family and pediatric brands, providing parents with evidence-based guidance and recommendations for baby and kids gear. We consulted with health experts to help guide our selections. That includes Allie Ticktin, a pediatric occupational therapist and specialist in sensory integration, founder of Play 2 Progress and author of the book Play to Progress; Elizabeth Morel, owner of Little Movers PT, a pediatric physical therapy office in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey; Victoria Regan M.D., a pediatrician at Children’s Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston; and Anthony Hudson, M.D., a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital New Orleans. We made sure all of our selections align with Academy of American Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations. We regularly review this article for accuracy and freshness. It was most recently updated in June 2024 by Rimmon to include a buying guide. How We Chose The Best Baby Walkers And Alternatives We spoke with two pediatricians and two pediatric therapists to get to the bottom of baby walkers dos and don’ts. Unsurprisingly, none of them recommend the wheeled, sit-in variety. All our choices on this list, like stationary activity centers and push walkers, meet the safety recommendations of our health experts and the AAP. We also combed through parents’ favorite push walkers, activity tables and stations, and made a list of those bestsellers that most matched the experts’ recommendations, reading reviews closely and looking only at those with the best ratings. We looked for toys that encourage open-ended play and can hold most toddlers’ attention for a reasonable amount of time. We considered price, durability and user rating when making our final selections. What To Consider When Shopping For A Baby Walker When choosing a baby walker, it’s important to think about safety, how much it encourages open-ended play and size. Safety The most important feature when shopping for a baby walker is safety. Ticktin advises parents to ensure that the baby walker has the necessary safety certifications. Look for walkers that comply with safety and quality standards established by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission. You can find this safety information on the product packaging or on the manufacturer’s website. Ticktin suggests paying close attention to walkers with wheels. She warns that walkers with wheels can move too quickly, causing kids to fall forward. If you choose a walker with wheels, select one with brakes, non-slip wheels or features that slow it down. To prevent falls, block off stairwells with a baby gate when your little one is on the move. Ticktin points out that a baby walker with a wider base offers more stability. When you're shopping for a baby walker, keep an eye out for walkers that have a broader base, as they provide better support and balance for your child as they explore. If you can’t supervise your child closely, the AAP suggests play yards, baby seats and even high chairs as places for babies to safely hangout in during playtime. Open-Ended Play Ticktin recommends walkers that offer open-ended play opportunities. These walkers do more than just help with pushing and walking—they support various activities like pulling up to stand and encouraging imaginative play. Plus, these walkers can grow with your child, turning into fun toys for pretend play. Some even come with benches or seats for dolls and stuffed animals, perfect for use as strollers or grocery carts to spark your child's creativity. Open-ended toys encourage children to use their imagination during playtime. To promote this creative freedom, consider choosing a walker that doesn't rely on batteries. Ticktin explains that battery-operated walkers can limit opportunities for open-ended play because they dictate the play experience. For example, if the walker comes packed with buttons and gadgets that produce sounds or movements, it takes away the chance for your baby to actively engage in play. Size Choose a walker that fits your space. Baby walkers can be bulky and take up valuable space in your home. If you're tight on space or live in a small apartment, a walker might just add clutter without much benefit. “Less is more when it comes to toys. If this item is going to add clutter to your play space, skip it,” Ticktin advises. Are Baby Walkers Safe? Traditional baby walkers (seats with trays on wheels) have been redesigned so that they’re safer to use, but the AAP still warns against them. The pediatricians and pediatric physical therapists we interviewed don’t like them either. “Several infant deaths occurred in the past from baby walkers, as well as many emergency room visits due to falls, even after the ‘safety’ modifications made in the late 1990s,” says Regan. “They do not help a baby’s development and definitely do not help them learn to walk. We now only advise stationary ‘baby walkers’ (activity centers) if a parent really wants to get one,” she says. If you’re eager to find a safe, healthy stationary baby walker, make sure the one you choose is age appropriate and certified as safe by the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association, Regan advises. “Never use one when your child is less than 6 months of age,” she says. Do be aware that spending lots of time in a stationary, seated baby activity center like an exersaucer isn’t ideal for your child’s development. The seat is often too big to for proper support and it may not be the correct height from the floor. That encourages the “overall use of inappropriate muscles and compensatory patterns,” explains Morel, which can lead to asymmetry and toe walking. For push toys, she adds, you can weigh them down or put rubber bands on the wheels to slow their roll and help babies keep up. Can Baby Walkers Encourage Walking? In short, no. “Many parents think walkers will help their children develop and learn to walk,” says Anthony Hudson, M.D., a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital New Orleans. “Walkers can delay when a child starts to walk.” Morel explained this is because baby walkers and push toys encourage babies to put their weight in their tiptoes, which can affect how steadily they walk without support. Push toys in particular can impact babies’ balance. “They work with momentum,” Morel says. “That often leads to tiptoe walking to keep up. And when you use hands on handles the core turns off.” That can hinder Baby from building the strength they need to walk unassisted, so it’s best to keep an eye on any of this behavior developing in your child. What Are The Benefits Of Baby Walkers? Many baby walkers and alternatives like stationary activity centers have toys and music that help babies refine their senses and motor skills, as well as learn numbers, shapes, colors, letters and first words. The best ones “have attachments that may entertain your child and could help reinforce developmental skills like reaching for objects, using pincer grasp,” says Regan. The benefit mostly is for parents, who get a short break from entertaining baby as you did with an infant swing when they were younger. What Are The Different Types Of Baby Walkers? Although traditional baby walkers (seats with trays on wheels that let babies push themselves around) are still available, the term baby walker now encompasses stationary activity centers (with or without bouncy platforms) and activity tables without seats, as well as push toys that babies use while standing up and walking. How Big Does A Baby Have To Be To Use A Walker? The age range for baby walkers and alternatives vary depending on the height and features. To safely use activity tables or centers, make sure your baby is physically ready. You’ll know when they’re able to pull up to stand and have the core control to maintain it, says Morel. Push toys should be used only by babies who already have begun walking on their own.",

Pros: Supportive wrist rest Numpad is separate from the keyboard for customizability Cons: No USB-C charging Numpad only lasts six months on batteries Just launched, the HP 960 Ergonomic Keyboards ticks all of our boxes, earning the best ergonomic keyboard overall moniker. It features a comfortable, padded wrist rest that we found feels supportive throughout the work day. While it has a split keyframe layout, it separated the numeric keypad so you can customize your setup to how you want it. A dongle connects via Bluetooth, and it is certified for up to 12 million keystrokes for the standard keys. That being said, there are some minor drawbacks. The keyboard itself lasts for up to two years on AA batteries—so no USB-C charging. And, the numeric keypad also lasts up to six months and requires two coin cell batteries. However, these minor drawbacks still make it worthwhile, as the scissor key switches feel responsive and there’s very little switch resistance—a must-have for us—after testing it for a few weeks. Plus, it’s one of the quieter ergonomic keyboards, though you’ll still hear some clacking as you hammer away. It also comes with a dedicated Microsoft Copilot button, too, and 20 programmable keys.

Honorable Mention: Everything You Need For Comfortable Typing Amazon Logitech Ergo K860 Wireless Keyboard Design: One piece, split keyframe | Key type: Asymmetrical keys | Wireless: Yes (33 foot range) | Size: 9.2 x 17.9 x 1.9 inches | Keyboard layout: Full size Best for: Working professionals who spend a lot of time typing. Pros: Unique adjustable wrist support One piece, split keyframe design Full size keyboard Cons: Keyboard is not backlit The Logitech Ergo K860 is designed for comfort and to provide ergonomic support throughout your workday. This is a full-size keyboard with a numeric keypad. It uses a split keyframe layout. It also includes a plush wrist support—adjustable to 0, -4 or -7 degrees for negative tilt support. The keyboard offers both a Bluetooth wireless and a USB wired option. The scooped keys are quiet and are designed to match the shape of your fingertips, so they allow for smooth and accurate typing. According to Logitech, the design of this keyboard reduces muscle activity by 21% in the upper trapezius muscle—the muscle located in the center of the back. It stabilizes and facilitates shoulder and neck movement. In other words, the keyboard’s design can reduce muscle strain in your fingers, wrists, arms, neck, shoulders and back. When used in wireless more, the keyboard can connect to up to three devices and easily switch between them. Best Budget Ergonomic Keyboard Designed For Smaller Hands Dell Logitech Wave Keys Design: One piece | Key type: Keys with scissor switches | Wireless: Yes | Size: 8.6 x 14.8 x 1.2 inches | Keyboard layout: Full size Best for: Anyone on a budget who does a lot of typing or data entry at their computer. Pros: A full-size, ergonomic keyboard Quiet keys for typing Cons: Some may not enjoy the keys’ resistance Battery-powered Logitech’s newest keyboard, the Wave Keys, is a well made and nicely designed ergonomic keyboard. While the keyboard itself its split, it uses a single keyframe. The keyboard itself offers a non-adjustable, but optional reverse incline, allowing for more comfortable wrist positioning. This is enhanced by the keyboard’s plush wrist rest, which we found accommodates the natural angle your hands. Aesthetically, the keyboard uses a lot of plastic. It offers no backlighting and none of the keys are programmable. It’s very much a straight forward keyboard with an ergonomically designed shape and incline. The keyboard is also rather quiet, and you can connect the keyboard via the USB-C dongle or Bluetooth. The keyboard itself is powered using one AAA batteries that lasts for two years. Best Ergonomic Gaming Keyboard Spit It In Half And For Added Comfort Amazon Kinesis Gaming Freestyle Edge Switch type: Cherry MX, Brown MX, Blue MX or Silver MX | Size: Tenkeyless | Backlighting: Per-key RGB | Connection: Wired Best for: Gaming—and typing—in comfort. Pros: Available with a range of Cherry MX switch options Versatile for added comfort Completely remappable keys Cons: Steep adjustment curve Cherry MX switches aren’t cutting edge Most ergonomic keyboards aren’t designed with gaming in mind, which makes the Kinesis Gaming Freestyle Edge stand out amongst the crowd. The split design offers a range of Cherry MX mechanical switches, and for gamers who need that high-speed responsiveness, it delivers. Since it has an adjustable design, during our testing, we liked that we could reposition both to keep our hands and wrists comfortable. A cable attaches the two halves, leaving a space open to put your favorite wireless gaming mouse in the center for enhanced ergonomics, too. Plus, while many keyboards offer a backlight, the Freestyle Edge goes the extra mile with a fun, customizable RGB build. You also get a host of media controls, which are intuitive and easy to use. And, of course, the mechanical keys can be programmed. Best Portable Ergonomic Keyboard Tuck It Into Your Carry-On Amazon Moko Foldable Bluetooth Keyboard Design: Folding, one piece, split keyframe | Key Type: Scissor mechanism beneath each key | Wireless: Yes | Size: 12.9 x 4 x 0.9 inches (unfolded) | Keyboard layout: Tenkeyless Best for: Using with an iOS, Android or Windows (but not Windows mobile) smartphone or tablet. Pros: Affordable Very thin and compact Cons: No backlighting No numeric keyboard No cushioned wrist pad In addition to being extremely portable, the Moko Foldable Bluetooth Keyboard uses a U-shaped surface with a 166-degree design with 104 full-size keys. The built in rechargeable battery lasts for about 60 hours of continuous use, and when folded, it uses magnets to hold the keyboard shut during transport. When folded, it easily fits in a pocket or purse thanks to its compact design (6.2 x 4 x 0.5 inches). It weighs a mere 6.2 ounces. When unfolded, the ergonomic, tenkeyless design makes typing comfortable, with keys that offer a quick response. This keyboard is particularly useful for giving a tablet more laptop computer-related functionality, especially when used for keyboard-intensive applications, like word processing. It’s also very travel-friendly. What we like is the soft-grip coating which offers the keyboard protection during travel, but keeps the keyboard from slipping around when it’s being used. Our other favorite feature that we’ve used this keyboard for? We’ve placed it over our laptop keys when traveling for a more comfortable typing experience. Its 40-hour battery life also makes it easy to work throughout the week before it needs a recharge, too. Best Premium Ergonomic Keyboard A Keyboard The Folks At NASA Would Love MOST POPULAR ZSA Technology Labs Ergodox Moonlander Mark 1 Design: Split keyboard | Key Type: Mechanical switches | Wireless: Yes | Size: 6.7 x 9.8 x 1.1 inches (each half) | Keyboard layout: Customizable Best for: Using as a featured-packed, ergonomic keyboard for play or work. Pros: Futuristic design Complete customizability Programmable RGB lighting Cons: Expensive There’s a learning curve, but tutorial videos to help Not only does this ergonomic keyboard have a really cool name—Moonlander Mark 1—it has the design, appearance and functionality to back it up and justify its hefty price. The fully mechanical keyboard is equipped with RGB LEDs and can display smart animations across all keys. Because the keyboard is two separate pieces, gamers can use the left side only (in conjunction with a gaming mouse). Another cool feature is the built in audio output, so the keyboard can generate visual and audible feedback as you work. Of course, you can easily turn off or adjust the audio. Ergodox Moonlander Mark 1 takes the concept of customizability to a new level. You can order the keyboard with printed or blank keys which can then be moved around to create your own non-QWERTY layout. Each keycap is sculpted to provided added comfort and enhance accuracy when typing. Another way you can customize the keyboard when placing your order is you can choose between 10 switch types—and if you’re not sure which one is best for you, the company’s website or customer service team will help you choose. Oh, and you can add a tenting system too, so you can adjust the tilt of the keyboard to your perfect angle. When not in use, the Moonlander Mark 1 folds up for transport and holds together using magnets. A carrying case is included. Another unique feature is the built in thumb module which can be tilted up or down, based on the size of your hands. There’s also an attachable wrist support module. MORE FROMFORBES VETTED The Best Baby Walkers And Alternatives To Keep Tots Happy And Safe By Elyse Moody Contributor The Absolute Best 4-Slice Toasters, Based On Rigorous Testing By Kelly Vaughan Contributor Why Trust Forbes Vetted The Forbes Vetted tech team is well-versed in all things digital, having written articles and in the category (a couple of staffers, including Dave Johnson, our deputy editor, have even authored books). The Forbes Vetted tech team has written an extensive library of keyboard stories. In addition to covering the best keyboards, they’ve also covered the best gaming keyboards, the best wireless keyboards and the quietest keyboards. The tech section is overseen by consumer tech and electronics editor Rebecca Isaacs, an industry veteran who has been covering consumer technology for over five years. As a co-writer of this story, she has personally tested every single ergonomic keyboard on this list. When she’s not testing keyboards, she’s writing about the latest launches, including gaming TVs, portable chargers, noise-canceling headphones and more. Former contributor Jason R. Rich, the co-author of this story, is an accomplished writer, journalist, photographer and experienced product tester. Over his career, he has accumulated hours of in-depth product research and has conducted firsthand testing. Every keyboard on this list was personally tested by executive editor Dave Johnson and Rebecca Isaacs. Each tester logged in at least 20 hours with each keyboard to get a better understanding of how it worked over long typing periods. We know tech tends to become quickly outdated. To keep this piece fresh and accurate, it’s regularly updated. Its current iteration was published in June 2024 to include the all-new HP 960 Ergonomic Wireless Keyboard and the Kinesis Gaming Freestyle Edge keyboard. How We Chose The Best Ergonomic Keyboards Here at Forbes Vetted, we’re writers and editors, and so we’re spending long hours at our laptops and computers. And to keep our own wrists and hands healthy, we put each of these ergonomic keyboards to the test. We looked at major brands who have created ergonomic keyboards including Microsoft, HP, Logitech and more. From there, we narrowed our list, using our combined research with our own hands-on testing and experience with many of these keyboards. During our testing, we carefully evaluated each keyboard’s design, key layout, ease of use, extra features and more. We also checked to see how it felt after typing for hours on each ergonomic keyboard, noting any areas in our hands and wrists that ached, if any. We also spoke with product experts and industry leaders to help us determine the top ergonomic keyboards that make the cut.",

In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network's sports app, you'll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV.

                    "title": "How Biden and Trump are preparing for their first presidential debate",
                    "text": "(CNN) — One is secluding himself at a mountainside retreat with a tight circle of advisers, poring over briefing binders, honing attack lines and bracing for personal smears. The other is workshopping responses and retorts with vice presidential hopefuls, sharpening policy lines while working to rein in his bombastic rhetoric. In some ways, aides to President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump describe similar goals heading into next Thursday’s presidential debate: painting their opponent as presiding over disorder and wholly unfit for office. For two men who have been circling each other rhetorically for the past four years, the debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta amounts to a moment of high consequence. Both candidates are aware of the stakes, officials in both campaigns say, as they huddle with their teams to prepare attacks, form rebuttals and frame the choice of November’s election. Both teams have spent the past weeks working to fine-tune their message on a wide array of issues, from the economy to foreign affairs to their rival’s fitness for office. And each has found themselves distracted in some way: Trump by the criminal trial that consumed his spring and Biden by a stretch of intensive overseas travel and a painful legal saga for his family. Yet the similarities mostly end there. How each man is preparing for the debate is ultimately a microcosm of their differences as candidates, and each will enter the CNN studio with divergent objectives. In prep sessions that have already started, Biden has been focused on ways to hold Trump accountable on the debate stage – mirroring the broader political strategy that his White House and campaign have been deploying for months. “The president has gotten increasingly punchier in recent remarks about Trump and plans to carry that theme through to the debate,” one Biden campaign official said. After months of suggesting that the American electorate was tuned out of the 2024 race, the Biden camp sees the debate as a starting block of sorts, and a chance to present its study of candidate contrasts in front of a new and engaged audience. Trump, meanwhile, is aiming to assure voters he can be a steadier and more effective leader than his successor, despite the legal issues swirling around him and a deeply divisive approach to politics. Some of his debate prep has focused less on policy, but on rhetoric. Trump has previously struggled with policy debates, instead preferring to meander and generalize – especially without a teleprompter. He’s also been quick to show aggression in past debates, including speaking over his opponents and attacking the moderators, moves that stuck with viewers in the months that followed. “I’ll probably be negotiating with three people, but that’s OK. I’ve done that before,” Trump told his supporters Tuesday at a rally in Racine, Wisconsin, referring to Biden and CNN’s moderators. “I’ll be debating three people instead of one, instead of one half of a person.” Debate camp To get ready, Biden is gathering trusted aides this week and next at Camp David, the mountainside presidential retreat, for several days of intensive discussion and preparation. The secluded complex of rustic lodges in Maryland has, in the past, helped focus Biden and his team ahead of important moments such as State of the Union speeches. The preparations are expected to progress over a series of days, evolving from informal discussions about topics, questions and potential responses and culminating in more formal 90-minute mock debates. The president will likely be fueled by his favorite drink of orange Gatorade. (CNN debate rules stipulate that each candidate will have a pen, writing pad and a bottle of water at the podium.) The White House is preserving the possibility that the president and his team could travel to Atlanta directly from Camp David, depending on how much practice remains. Aides have been compiling binders of questions – with possible answers to each of them – on a wide range of topics for the president to peruse. Four years ago, Biden is said to have offered detailed feedback on every anticipated topic, sometimes rejecting certain suggestions altogether. At other points, he pushed aides to home in deeper on one subject matter or frame a response in a different way. Biden’s former chief of staff, Ron Klain, is taking the lead to help the president get ready to debate Trump, a Biden campaign official told CNN. Beyond knowing and working for Biden for decades, Klain is the party’s most seasoned debate coach, having worked with Democratic candidates in nearly every presidential race over the past three decades. Bruce Reed, another longtime aide who currently serves as Biden’s deputy chief of staff, has been charged with sifting through reams of material and hours of prior Trump appearances to inform the practice sessions. Earlier this year, Reed led the process to compile the policy substance and rhetorical flair that became Biden’s hourlong State of the Union address. Biden’s personal lawyer, Bob Bauer, is likely to reprise his role as a stand-in for Trump in mock debate sessions, two sources said. Bauer, once a top attorney for Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns and administration, wrote in a new book that he emulated his “Trump-worst” to help Biden anticipate his opponent’s antics and attacks in 2020. While the president sees the team’s deep knowledge of him as a candidate and its record as an asset, one adviser says there may also be a bit of superstition at play. “He won with that team four years ago, so he’s going to stick with them now,” a Biden adviser said. Other close senior advisers to the president, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and senior White House advisers Anita Dunn, Mike Donilon and Cedric Richmond are also involved in preparations. The Biden team has long argued that once voters begin paying attention to the race, they will see the choice as the study in contrasts the president has promoted endlessly, but which has failed to move the needle in polling. With tens of millions of Americans expected to watch the debate – aides point to recent polling that shows most likely voters plan to tune in – that theory will be tested. The Biden camp plans to lean heavily on prior Trump comments that – while widely covered by the political media – may not have registered on the radars of the average voter, according to sources involved in the discussions. Klain, according to a confidante, has quipped that preparing to debate Trump should be straightforward because “he only ever says eight things,” referring to the former president’s tendency to hash out familiar grievances on social media. While the list of those Trumpisms – and rebukes – is still being tailored, there’s one that is sure to come up, according to one source involved: Trump’s December 2023 suggestion that he would not rule like a dictator “other than Day One.” ‘Policy sessions’ Trump, meanwhile, has deployed the help of some of his top contenders for vice president, as well as senators, policy experts and outside allies, to help brief him ahead of next week’s debate. In recent weeks, Trump has participated in roughly a dozen of these private meetings, dubbed as informal “policy discussions” by his campaign, sources familiar with the sessions told CNN. The subjects of the meetings have ranged from sharpening his messaging on the economy, the border and crime, to his views on abortion, the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine and how to best frame his May 30 conviction on 34 counts of business fraud, the sources said. Earlier this month, Trump huddled with Ohio Sen. JD Vance and members of the former president’s staff at Mar-a-Lago for one such briefing, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the meeting. The informal session focused on messaging around the economy, including how to best hammer Biden on inflation – an issue Trump’s campaign argues is the top concern for voters this fall. Trump engaged in a similar policy discussion with Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Eric Schmitt of Missouri at the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, DC, last week, following his meeting with House and Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill, CNN previously reported. Among the topics discussed were democracy and how to respond to the inevitable questions regarding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, including Trump’s response to the riot incited by his supporters that day. Trump’s co-campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, also attended the meeting and offered advice on how to most effectively address the issue. Other meetings have taken place with senior advisers Kellyanne Conway and Stephen Miller, as well as his former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell. Mock debates None of Trump’s sessions so far have included mock debates or role-playing, sources said, something the Trump campaign currently has no plans for the former president to engage in – a departure from 2020 when Trump faced off behind closed doors with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie standing in for Biden. On the Biden side, casting for a Trump stand-in this year remains open, with an expectation that Biden’s personal lawyer, Bauer – who stood in for Trump four years ago – could easily reprise his role. “We set aside special sessions during which I was expected to be at my Trump-worst – as personally insulting and unhinged as Trump can be,” Bauer recalled in his book released this week, describing his practice of “lying and blustering and bullying my way through the mock sessions.” In fact, trying to prepare for a wide range of unpredictable scenarios that Biden might be confronted with when standing a handful of yards away from Trump was one of the most important goals of the mock debates in the fall of 2020, according to those who were in the room. Those scenarios included everything from long-winded answers to the possibility of Trump hurling personal insults. In the last cycle, Biden aides were particularly sensitive to Trump attacking members of Biden’s family on the debate stage. “Part of the aim of the prep process was to really acclimate Biden to the idea that Trump was potentially going to say really horrible things about his own family, his kids, so that Biden would be prepared and would not feel caught off guard by Trump’s style,” former White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said. Biden’s son, Hunter, was recently convicted on three felony gun charges – a development that the president and his aides are certain to be bracing for as a potential attack line. Expectations game Trump’s advisers, who are wary of using the words “debate prep” when it comes to the former president, have consistently downplayed the notion that he requires the type of preparation that other candidates – and specifically, Biden – need for such a high-stakes debate. Instead, they have pointed to Trump’s rallies and media interviews as examples of how Trump is gearing up to take Biden on, including taking questions from friendly audience members at recent events. “President Trump takes on numerous tough interviews every single week and delivers lengthy rally speeches while standing, demonstrating elite stamina,” senior Trump adviser Jason Miller, who is running point on Trump’s efforts in advance of the debate, said in a statement. Ahead of the Atlanta debate, Trump plans to hold a campaign rally in Philadelphia, a city Biden has already visited several times this year as he works to replicate his 2020 victory in Pennsylvania. The former president’s allies and advisers point out that Trump has not only appeared on several presidential debate stages over the past decade, but he has also debated Biden before – a key reason, they say, for the less conventional approach to the preparations. But while the Trump campaign’s version of debate prep is unlike the traditional planning most past candidates – and even Trump himself – have engaged in, people close to the former president told CNN his team acknowledges there is still work to do before he takes the stage in Atlanta. “There’s no question the debate will show Trump is the stronger candidate and the better choice, especially when you see the stark contrast with Biden, physically, mentally and so on. But that doesn’t mean Trump shouldn’t, or isn’t preparing,” said a person close to Trump, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. “He isn’t going into this without doing his homework,” the person added.

                    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — President Joe Biden begins an intense period of private preparations Friday at Camp David for what may be the most consequential presidential debate in decades. The 81-year-old Democrat’s team is aware that he cannot afford an underwhelming performance when he faces Republican rival Donald Trump for 90 minutes on live television Thursday night. Biden’s team is expecting aggressive attacks on his physical and mental strength, his record on the economy and immigration and even his family. Trump, 78 and ever confident, will stay on the campaign trail before going to his Florida estate next week for two days of private meetings as part of an informal prep process. The former president’s allies are pushing him to stay focused on his governing plans, but they’re expecting him to be tested by pointed questions about his unrelenting focus on election fraud, his role in the erosion of abortion rights and his unprecedented legal baggage. Thursday’s debate on CNN will be full of firsts, with the potential to reshape the presidential race. Never before in the modern era have two presumptive nominees met on the debate stage so early in the general election season. Never before have two White House contenders faced off at such advanced ages, with widespread questions about their readiness. And never before has a general election debate participant been saddled with a felony conviction. The debate-stage meeting comes just two weeks before Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on 34 felony counts in his New York hush money trial. “You can argue this will be the most important debate, at least in my lifetime,” said Democratic strategist Jim Messina, 54, who managed former President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign. PRESSURE ON BIDEN The ground rules for Thursday’s debate, the first of two scheduled meetings, are unusual. The candidates agreed to meet at a CNN studio in Atlanta with no audience. Each candidate’s microphone will be muted, except when it’s his turn to speak. No props or prewritten notes will be allowed onstage. The candidates will be given only a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water. There will be no opening statements. A coin flip determined that Biden would stand at the podium to the viewer’s right, while Trump would deliver the final closing statement. The next debate won’t be until September. Any stumbles Thursday will be hard to erase or replace quickly. Biden arrived at Camp David on Thursday night and is expected to hunker down with senior campaign aides until next Thursday’s debate. While traveling to the mountainside retreat, he gave a thumbs up to reporters when asked how debate prep was going. The president’s aides have been reluctant to share details about his specific preparations, run by former chief of staff Ron Klain. But they have signaled that he is preparing to be aggressive and would not shy away from using the term “convicted felon” to describe his opponent onstage. One adviser not authorized to speak publicly about debate strategy noted that Biden has been increasingly punchier in recent remarks about Trump and plans to carry that theme through to the debate. That’s still while trying to project himself as “the wise and steady leader” in contrast to Trump, the adviser said. Among some political operatives, there is the sense that Biden may have the most to lose given his struggle to generate momentum amid signs of weakness within his political coalition. Trump and his allies have set an extraordinarily low bar, however, by suggesting for months that Biden is contending with serious physical limitations that make it difficult for him to stand for 90 minutes or even string together two sentences. “It’s like the mirror test. Put a mirror under Biden’s nose, and if it fogs it up, he wins, right? That’s about what the threshold is for Biden,” Republican strategist and Trump ally David Urban said with a laugh. “Can Biden demonstrate that he’s mentally nimble? That’s the big question.” Yet Trump himself sought to shift expectations in a Thursday interview with the “The All-In Podcast” in which he veered sharply away from his typical Biden taunts. He said Biden “destroyed” vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan in their 2012 debate. “I assume he’s going to be somebody that will be a worthy debater,” Trump said of Biden. “I don’t want to underestimate him.” Biden’s aides have dismissed concerns about his age and mental readiness. They are fighting back against what they allege is deceptive editing of video clips to suggest he is confused. But while some Democrats are projecting confidence, Biden’s allies also say the president has spent much of the last two weeks traveling — in Europe and on the West Coast — which has limited his ability to prepare. Others note that incumbent presidents typically struggle in the season’s opening general election debate. Messina made both points even as he sought to play up the political stakes for Trump. He suggested Trump was taking an unnecessary political risk by debating Biden at all, given Trump’s early advantage in many polls. “I wouldn’t have done the debate if I was him,” Messina said of Trump. “If you’re tied or a little bit ahead of the incumbent, why would you want to give him this air? He decided he wanted to do this to knock him out, and if he doesn’t, then I think he’s in real trouble.” TRUMP PROJECTING CONFIDENCE Trump’s team sees Thursday’s faceoff as an opportunity to demonstrate a clear contrast with Biden’s leadership ability and governing record. And while they’re downplaying his preparations, Trump aides have a pattern of insisting that he doesn’t prepare for debates when, in fact, he does — in his own way. Instead of mock debates with lecterns and stand-ins or hours spent poring over policy books, the former president is expected to rely on a series of conversations about policy and strategy with aides and political allies. Trump will also make a series of public appearances over the coming days. On Saturday, he’s set to host a rally in Philadelphia and deliver a keynote address to a conference of Christian conservatives in Washington. He also has a fundraiser in New Orleans on Monday before going to his Florida estate for meetings. “Biden needs rehearsals with handlers to find some way to explain this mess he’s made of our nation,” Trump spokesman Brian Hughes said. “President Trump is always prepared to present to Americans his record of success and Biden’s weakness and failures.” Biden’s camp is also aware that Trump will likely focus on his son Hunter, as the then-president did on the debate stage four years ago. Hunter Biden was recently convicted on three felony charges related to the purchase of a gun while allegedly being addicted to drugs. Republicans have also criticized Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings when Joe Biden was vice president. Biden’s allies are also concerned, however, that their famously combative rival might be on good behavior. “For both campaigns, the goal here is reaching an audience of moderate, independent, swing voters in swing states who will, in many ways, be the deciding factor in this election,” said former Biden administration official Bill Russo. “Trump has kind of a golden opportunity here. If he can pretend that he’s a reasonable human being for 90 minutes while he’s in the spotlight, he’s got a lot to gain,” Russo added. “The real key here is which Trump shows up.” ___ Associated Press writers Michelle L.

                    "text": "NEW YORK — President Joe Biden begins an intense period of private preparations Friday at Camp David for what may be the most consequential presidential debate in decades. The 81-year-old Democrat’s team is aware he cannot afford an underwhelming performance when he faces Republican rival Donald Trump for 90 minutes on live television June 27. Biden’s team expects aggressive attacks on his physical and mental strength, his record on the economy and immigration and even his family. Trump, 78 and ever confident, will stay on the campaign trail before going to his Florida estate next week for two days of private meetings as part of an informal prep process. The ex-president’s allies are pushing him to stay focused on his governing plans but expect him to be tested by pointed questions about his unrelenting focus on election fraud, his role in the erosion of abortion rights and his unprecedented legal baggage. The CNN debate will be full of firsts, with the potential to reshape the presidential race. Never before in the modern era have two presumptive nominees met on the debate stage so early in the general election season. Never before have two White House contenders faced off at such advanced ages, with widespread questions about their readiness. And never before has a general election debate participant been saddled with a felony conviction. The debate stage meeting comes just two weeks before Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on 34 felony counts in his New York hush money trial. “You can argue this will be the most important debate, at least in my lifetime,” said Democratic strategist Jim Messina, a 54-year-old who managed President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign. The ground rules for the June 27 debate, the first of two scheduled meetings, are unusual. The candidates agreed to meet at a CNN studio in Atlanta with no audience. Each candidate’s microphone will be muted, except when it’s his turn to speak. No props or prewritten notes will be allowed onstage. The candidates will be given only a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water. There will be no opening statements. A coin flip determined Biden would stand at the podium to the viewer’s right, while Trump would deliver the final closing statement. The next debate won’t be until September. Any stumbles June 27 will be hard to erase or replace quickly. Biden arrived at Camp David on Thursday night and is expected to hunker down with senior campaign aides until the debate. While traveling to the mountainside retreat, he gave a thumbs up to reporters when asked how debate prep was going. The president’s aides have been reluctant to share details about his preparations, run by former chief of staff Ron Klain. But they’ve signaled he’s preparing to be aggressive and wouldn’t shy away from using the term “convicted felon” to describe his opponent. One adviser not authorized to speak publicly about debate strategy noted Biden has been increasingly punchier in recent remarks about Trump and plans to carry that theme through to the debate. That’s still while trying to project himself as “the wise and steady leader” in contrast with Trump, the adviser said. Among some political operatives, there’s the sense Biden may have more to lose given his struggle to generate momentum amid signs of weakness within his political coalition. Trump and his allies have set an extraordinarily low bar, however, by suggesting for months Biden is contending with serious physical limitations that make it difficult for him to stand for 90 minutes or string together two sentences. “It’s like the mirror test. Put a mirror under Biden’s nose, and if it fogs it up, he wins, right? That’s about what the threshold is for Biden,” Republican strategist and Trump ally David Urban said with a laugh. “Can Biden demonstrate that he’s mentally nimble? That’s the big question.” Yet Trump sought to shift expectations in a Thursday interview with the “The All-In Podcast” in which he veered sharply away from his typical Biden taunts. He said Biden “destroyed” vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan in their 2012 debate. “I assume he’s going to be somebody that will be a worthy debater,” Trump said of Biden. “I don’t want to underestimate him.” Biden’s aides have dismissed concerns about his age and mental readiness. They’re fighting against what they allege is deceptive editing of video clips to suggest he’s confused. But while some Democrats project confidence, Biden’s allies also say he has spent much of the last two weeks traveling - in Europe and on the West Coast - limiting his ability to prepare. Others note incumbent presidents typically struggle in the season’s opening general election debate. Messina made both points even as he sought to play up the political stakes for Trump. He suggested Trump was taking an unnecessary political risk by debating Biden, given Trump’s early advantage in many polls. “I wouldn’t have done the debate if I was him,” Messina said of Trump. “If you’re tied or a little bit ahead of the incumbent, why would you want to give him this air? He decided he wanted to do this to knock him out, and if he doesn’t, then I think he’s in real trouble.” Trump’s team sees the faceoff as an opportunity to demonstrate a clear contrast with Biden’s leadership ability and governing record. And while downplaying his preparations, Trump aides have a pattern of insisting he doesn’t prepare for debates when, in fact, he does - in his own way. Instead of mock debates with lecterns and stand-ins or hours spent poring over policy books, the ex-president is expected to rely on a series of conversations about policy and strategy with aides and political allies. Trump will also make public appearances over the coming days. On Saturday, he’s set to host a rally in Philadelphia and deliver a keynote address to a conference of Christian conservatives in Washington. He also has a fundraiser in New Orleans on Monday before going to his Florida estate for meetings. “Biden needs rehearsals with handlers to find some way to explain this mess he’s made of our nation,” Trump spokesman Brian Hughes said. “President Trump is always prepared to present to Americans his record of success and Biden’s weakness and failures.” Biden’s camp is aware Trump will likely focus on his son Hunter, as the then-president did on the debate stage four years ago. Hunter Biden was recently convicted on three felony charges related to the purchase of a gun while allegedly being addicted to drugs. Republicans have also criticized Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings when Joe Biden was vice president. Biden’s allies are also concerned, however, their famously combative rival might be on good behavior. “For both campaigns, the goal here is reaching an audience of moderate, independent, swing voters in swing states who will, in many ways, be the deciding factor in this election,” said former Biden administration official Bill Russo. “Trump has kind of a golden opportunity here. If he can pretend that he’s a reasonable human being for 90 minutes while he’s in the spotlight, he’s got a lot to gain,” Russo added. “The real key here is which Trump shows up.” ___ Associated Press writers Michelle L.

                    "text": "By STEVE PEOPLES (AP National Political Writer) NEW YORK (AP) — President Joe Biden begins an intense period of private preparations Friday at Camp David for what may be the most consequential presidential debate in decades. The 81-year-old Democrat’s team is aware he cannot afford an underwhelming performance when he faces Republican rival Donald Trump for 90 minutes on live television June 27. Biden’s team expects aggressive attacks on his physical and mental strength, his record on the economy and immigration and even his family. Trump, 78 and ever confident, will stay on the campaign trail before going to his Florida estate next week for two days of private meetings as part of an informal prep process. The ex-president’s allies are pushing him to stay focused on his governing plans but expect him to be tested by pointed questions about his unrelenting focus on election fraud, his role in the erosion of abortion rights and his unprecedented legal baggage. The CNN debate will be full of firsts, with the potential to reshape the presidential race. Never before in the modern era have two presumptive nominees met on the debate stage so early in the general election season. Never before have two White House contenders faced off at such advanced ages, with widespread questions about their readiness. And never before has a general election debate participant been saddled with a felony conviction. The debate stage meeting comes just two weeks before Trump is scheduled to be sentenced on 34 felony counts in his New York hush money trial. “You can argue this will be the most important debate, at least in my lifetime,” said Democratic strategist Jim Messina, a 54-year-old who managed President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign. The ground rules for the June 27 debate, the first of two scheduled meetings, are unusual. The candidates agreed to meet at a CNN studio in Atlanta with no audience. Each candidate’s microphone will be muted, except when it’s his turn to speak. No props or prewritten notes will be allowed onstage. The candidates will be given only a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water. There will be no opening statements. A coin flip determined Biden would stand at the podium to the viewer’s right, while Trump would deliver the final closing statement. The next debate won’t be until September. Any stumbles June 27 will be hard to erase or replace quickly. Biden arrived at Camp David on Thursday night and is expected to hunker down with senior campaign aides until the debate. While traveling to the mountainside retreat, he gave a thumbs up to reporters when asked how debate prep was going. The president’s aides have been reluctant to share details about his preparations, run by former chief of staff Ron Klain. But they’ve signaled he’s preparing to be aggressive and wouldn’t shy away from using the term “convicted felon” to describe his opponent. One adviser not authorized to speak publicly about debate strategy noted Biden has been increasingly punchier in recent remarks about Trump and plans to carry that theme through to the debate. That’s still while trying to project himself as “the wise and steady leader” in contrast with Trump, the adviser said. “It’s like the mirror test. Put a mirror under Biden’s nose, and if it fogs it up, he wins, right? That’s about what the threshold is for Biden,” Republican strategist and Trump ally David Urban said with a laugh. “Can Biden demonstrate that he’s mentally nimble? That’s the big question.” Yet Trump sought to shift expectations in a Thursday interview with the “The All-In Podcast” in which he veered sharply away from his typical Biden taunts. He said Biden “destroyed” vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan in their 2012 debate. “I assume he’s going to be somebody that will be a worthy debater,” Trump said of Biden. “I don’t want to underestimate him.” Biden’s aides have dismissed concerns about his age and mental readiness. They’re fighting against what they allege is deceptive editing of video clips to suggest he’s confused. But while some Democrats project confidence, Biden’s allies also say he has spent much of the last two weeks traveling — in Europe and on the West Coast — limiting his ability to prepare. Others note incumbent presidents typically struggle in the season’s opening general election debate. Messina made both points even as he sought to play up the political stakes for Trump. He suggested Trump was taking an unnecessary political risk by debating Biden. “I wouldn’t have done the debate if I was him,” Messina said of Trump. The strategist added, “Why would you want to give him this air? He decided he wanted to do this to knock him out, and if he doesn’t, then I think he’s in real trouble.” Trump’s team sees the faceoff as an opportunity to demonstrate a clear contrast with Biden’s leadership ability and governing record. And while downplaying his preparations, Trump aides have a pattern of insisting he doesn’t prepare for debates when, in fact, he does — in his own way. Instead of mock debates with lecterns and stand-ins or hours spent poring over policy books, the ex-president is expected to rely on a series of conversations about policy and strategy with aides and political allies. Trump will also make public appearances over the coming days. On Saturday, he’s set to host a rally in Philadelphia and deliver a keynote address to a conference of Christian conservatives in Washington. He also has a fundraiser in New Orleans on Monday before going to his Florida estate for meetings. “Biden needs rehearsals with handlers to find some way to explain this mess he’s made of our nation,” Trump spokesman Brian Hughes said. “President Trump is always prepared to present to Americans his record of success and Biden’s weakness and failures.” Biden’s camp is aware Trump will likely focus on his son Hunter, as the then-president did on the debate stage four years ago. Hunter Biden was recently convicted on three felony charges related to the purchase of a gun while allegedly being addicted to drugs. Republicans have also criticized Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings when Joe Biden was vice president.

                    "text": "A federal appeals court panel on Thursday rejected longtime Donald Trump ally Steve Bannon's bid to stay out of prison while he fights his conviction for defying a subpoena from the House select committee that investigated the U.S. Capitol attack.Bannon is supposed to report to prison by July 1 to begin serving his four-month sentence for contempt of Congress.U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, earlier this month granted prosecutors' request to send Bannon to prison after another three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld his conviction last month.In its ruling last month, the D.C. Circuit panel said that Bannon didn't dispute that he deliberately refused to comply with the House select committee's subpoena, \"in that he knew what the subpoena required and intentionally did not respond; his nonresponse, in other words, was no accident.\" The D.C. Circuit panel also rejected Bannon's claims that the subpoena was invalid.Bannon's lawyers had asked the appeals court to allow him to remain free while he continues to fight the conviction all the way up to the Supreme Court, if necessary.Bannon, a White House chief strategist in the Trump administration, was convicted nearly two years ago of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in efforts by Trump, a Republican, to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to President Biden, a Democrat.",

Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 against Bannon, with Judge Justin Walker, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, dissenting. Bannon was sentenced to four months in prison in October 2022 after defying a congressional subpoena by the Jan. 6 Committee. The Department of Justice intervened earlier this week to ask the court to deny Bannon’s appeal for a delay. “Bannon also cannot reconcile his claim for special treatment with the bedrock principle of equal justice under the law. Even-handed application of the bail statute requires Bannon’s continued detention,” it said in a filing. Bannon’s lawyer argued in an emergency filing last week that he should remain out of prison because of his intention “to vigorously pursue his remaining appeals.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER “Before the prosecution of Mr. Bannon, it had been 50 years since the government convinced a jury to convict someone for not adequately responding to a congressional subpoena—and there has certainly been no shortage of disputes over congressional subpoenas during that time,” the filing read. “Mr. Bannon intends to vigorously pursue his remaining appeals in this case and has retained experienced Supreme Court counsel. In the meantime, he asks this Court to allow him to remain on release.” Bannon recently learned that he would be imprisoned in a low-security prison in Danbury, Connecticut, rather than the more comfortable minimum-security prison known as “Club Fed.”",

                    "text": "By ALANNA DURKIN RICHER (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal appeals court panel on Thursday rejected longtime Donald Trump ally Steve Bannon’s bid to stay out of prison while he fights his conviction for defying a subpoena from the House committee that investigated the U.S. Capitol attack. Bannon is supposed to report to prison by July 1 to begin serving his four-month sentence for contempt of Congress. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, earlier this month granted prosecutors’ request to send Bannon to prison after a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld his conviction. Bannon’s lawyers asked the appeals court to allow him to remain free while he continues to fight the conviction all the way up to the Supreme Court, if necessary. But in a 2-1 vote, the D.C. Circuit panel said Bannon’s case “does not warrant a departure from the general rule” that defendants begin serving their sentence after conviction. Judges Cornelia Pillard, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, and Bradley Garcia, a nominee of President Joe Biden, voted to send Bannon to prison. Judge Justin Walker, who was nominated by Trump, dissented, writing that he should not have to serve time before the Supreme Court decides whether to take up his case. Bannon is expected to ask the Supreme Court to stave off his prison sentence. His attorneys didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment Thursday. He was convicted nearly two years ago of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in efforts by Trump, a Republican, to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to Joe Biden, a Democrat. Bannon’s lawyer at trial argued that the former Trump adviser didn’t ignore the subpoena but was still engaged in good-faith negotiations with the congressional committee when he was charged. The defense has said Bannon had been relying on the advice on his attorney, who believed that Bannon couldn’t testify or produce documents because Trump had invoked executive privilege. Lawyers for Bannon say the case raises serious legal questions that will likely need to be resolved by the Supreme Court but he will have already finished his prison sentence by the time the case gets there. In court papers, Bannon’s lawyers also argued that there is a “strong public interest” in allowing him to remain free in the run-up to the 2024 election because Bannon is a top adviser to Trump’s campaign. Bannon’s lawyers said the Justice Department, in trying to imprison him now, is “giving an appearance that the government is trying to prevent Mr. Bannon from fully assisting with the campaign and speaking out on important issues, and also ensuring the government exacts its pound of flesh before the possible end of the Biden Administration.” Prosecutors said in court papers that Bannon’s “role in political discourse” is irrelevant. “Bannon also cannot reconcile his claim for special treatment with the bedrock principle of equal justice under the law,” prosecutors wrote. “Even-handed application of the bail statute requires Bannon’s continued detention.” A second Trump aide, trade adviser Peter Navarro, is already serving his four-month prison sentence for contempt of Congress. Navarro, too, has said he couldn’t cooperate with the committee because Trump had invoked executive privilege. The judge barred him from making that argument at trial, however, finding that he didn’t show Trump had actually invoked it. The House Jan. 6 committee’s final report asserted that Trump criminally engaged in a “multi-part conspiracy” to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 election and failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the Capitol, concluding an extraordinary 18-month investigation into the former president and the violent insurrection.",

                    "text": "A federal appeals court panel on Thursday rejected longtime Donald Trump ally Stephen K. Bannon's bid to stay out of prison while he fights his conviction for defying a subpoena from the House committee that investigated the U.S. Capitol attack. Bannon is supposed to report to prison by July 1 to begin serving his four-month sentence for contempt of Congress. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, who was nominated to the bench by former President Trump, earlier this month granted prosecutors' request to send Bannon to prison after a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld his conviction. Bannon's lawyers asked the appeals court to allow him to remain free while he continues to fight the conviction all the way up to the Supreme Court, if necessary. But in a 2-1 vote, the D.C. Circuit panel said Bannon's case “does not warrant a departure from the general rule” that defendants begin serving their sentence after conviction. Judges Cornelia Pillard, who was nominated by former President Obama, and Bradley Garcia, a nominee of President Biden, voted to send Bannon to prison. Judge Justin Walker, who was nominated by Trump, dissented, writing that he should not have to serve time before the Supreme Court decides whether to take up his case. Bannon is expected to ask the Supreme Court to stave off his prison sentence. His attorneys didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment Thursday. He was convicted nearly two years ago of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the House Jan. 6 committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in efforts by Trump, a Republican, to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to Biden, a Democrat. Bannon’s lawyer at trial argued that the former White House advisor didn’t ignore the subpoena but was still engaged in good-faith negotiations with the congressional committee when he was charged. The defense has said Bannon had been relying on the advice on his attorney, who believed that Bannon couldn’t testify or produce documents because Trump had invoked executive privilege. Lawyers for Bannon say the case raises serious legal questions that will likely need to be resolved by the Supreme Court but he will have already finished his prison sentence by the time the case gets there. In court papers, Bannon’s lawyers also argued that there is a “strong public interest” in allowing him to remain free in the run-up to the 2024 election because Bannon is an advisor to Trump’s campaign. Bannon’s lawyers said the Justice Department, in trying to imprison him now, is “giving an appearance that the government is trying to prevent Mr. Bannon from fully assisting with the campaign and speaking out on important issues, and also ensuring the government exacts its pound of flesh before the possible end of the Biden Administration.” Prosecutors said in court papers that Bannon’s “role in political discourse” is irrelevant. “Bannon also cannot reconcile his claim for special treatment with the bedrock principle of equal justice under the law,” prosecutors wrote. “Even-handed application of the bail statute requires Bannon’s continued detention.” Another former Trump aide, trade advisor Peter Navarro, is serving a four-month prison sentence for contempt of Congress. Navarro, too, has said he couldn’t cooperate with the committee because Trump had invoked executive privilege. The judge barred him from making that argument at trial, however, finding that he didn’t show Trump had invoked it. The House Jan. 6 committee’s final report concluded that Trump criminally engaged in a “multi-part conspiracy” to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 election and failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the Capitol, following an extraordinary 18-month investigation into the former president and the violent insurrection.

Former Trump advisor Steve Bannon took his appeal of his contempt of Congress conviction to the ... [+] Supreme Court. Getty Images Key Facts Bannon, a former aide in the Trump administration, was sentenced in October 2022 to four months in prison and a $6,500 fine for contempt of Congress one year after he failed to respond to a Jan. 6 Committee subpoena—though Bannon delayed his conviction, sparking a months-long delay of his sentence. Last month, however, a federal appeals court denied Bannon’s appeal on his conviction, ruling Bannon “knew what the subpoena required but did not appear or provide a single document,” though his lawyers later argued the sentence should still be postponed because Bannon can appeal to a higher court, such as the D.C. Circuit Court or Supreme Court. The D.C. Circuit Court panel refused to delay his sentence on Thursday, ruling Bannon’s appeal “does not warrant a departure from the general rule” of defendants serving their prison sentence after conviction. In a filing on Friday, Bannon’s attorneys took their case to the nation’s highest court, arguing Bannon “is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community if released.” Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

Key Background Bannon, the former chair of right-wing outlet Breitbart News, entered the national spotlight in 2016, when then-candidate Donald Trump brought him on as an executive for his presidential campaign, later becoming a chief strategist in the Trump administration. A major Trump ally, Bannon backed the former president’s claim the 2020 election was stolen from him, reiterating Trump’s baseless theory of widespread voter fraud. In September 2021, months after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, he was subpoenaed by the House Jan. 6 Select Committee, though he refused to cooperate, arguing he would not be able to testify before the committee because of executive privilege, and arguing his attorney advised him not to respond to the subpoena (an appeals court later rejected that argument, saying Bannon’s “advice of counsel defense is no defense at all.” Further Reading ForbesSteve Bannon Requests His July 1 Prison Reporting Date Be DroppedBy Antonio Pequeño IVForbesSteve Bannon Ordered To Go To Jail For Contempt Of Congress ConvictionBy Molly BohannonForbesSteve Bannon Will Go To Jail As He Loses Appeal On Contempt Of Congress ChargesBy Brian Bushard Send me a secure tip.

                    "text": "Judges, state lawmakers and voters are deciding the future of abortion in the U.S. two years after the Supreme Court jolted the legal status quo with a ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade. The June 24, 2022, ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization sparked legislative action, protest and numerous lawsuits - placing the issue at the center of politics across the country. Abortion is now banned at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, in 14 Republican-controlled states. In three other states, it’s barred after about the first six weeks, which is before many know they are pregnant. Most Democratic-led states have taken actions to protect abortion rights, and become sanctuaries for out-of-state patients seeking care. That’s changed the landscape of abortion access, making it more of a logistical and financial ordeal for many in conservative states. But it has not reduced the overall number of procedures done each month across the U.S. Here’s what to know about the state of abortion rights in the U.S. now. Bans in Republican-led states have prompted many people seeking abortions to travel to get care. That translates into higher costs for gas or plane tickets, hotels and meals; more logistics to figure out, including child care; and more days off work. A new study by the Guttmacher Institute, which advocates for abortion access, found that out of just over a million abortions provided in clinics, hospitals and doctors’ offices, more than 161,000 - or 16% - were for people who crossed state lines to get them. More than two-thirds of abortions done in Kansas and New Mexico were for out-of-staters, particularly Texans. Since Florida’s six-week abortion ban kicked in in May, many people had to travel farther than before, since throughout the Southeast, most states have bans. Low-income patients and those lacking legal permission to be in the country are more likely to be unable to travel. There can be lasting costs for those who do. In Alabama, the Yellowhammer Fund, which previously helped residents pay for the procedure has paused doing so since facing threats of litigation from the state. Jenice Fountain, Yellowhammer’s executive director, said she met a woman recently who traveled from Alabama to neighboring Georgia for an abortion but found she couldn’t get one there because she was slightly too far into her pregnancy. So she then went to Virginia. The journey wiped out her rent money and she needed help to remain housed. “We’re having people use every dime that they have to get out of state, or use every dime they have to have another child,” Fountain said. Nearly two-thirds of known abortions last year were provided with pills rather than procedures. One report found that pills are prescribed via telehealth and mailed to about 6,000 people a month who live in states with abortion bans. They’re sent by medical providers in states with laws intended to protect them from prosecution for those prescriptions. The laws in Colorado, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont and Washington specifically protect medical providers who prescribe the pills to patients in states with bans. The growing prominence of pills, which were used in about half of all abortions just before the Dobbs ruling, is a frontier in the latest chapter of the legal fight. The U.S. Supreme Court this month unanimously rejected an effort by abortion opponents who were seeking to overturn or roll back the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone, one of two drugs usually used together for medication abortions. The issue is likely to return. In this presidential election year, abortion is a key issue. Protecting access has emerged as a key theme in the campaigns of Democrats, including President Joe Biden in his reelection bid. Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has said states should decide whether to restrict abortions. He also suggested states could limit contraception use but changed his tune on that. “We recognize this could be the last Dobbs anniversary we celebrate,” Kelsey Pritchard, a spokesperson for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America said in an interview, noting that if Democrats win the presidency and regain control of both chambers of Congress, a right to abortion could be enshrined in the law. The issue will also be put directly before voters in at least four states. Colorado, Florida, Maryland and South Dakota have ballot measures this year asking voters to approve state constitutional amendments that would protect or expand access to abortion. There are attempts to put questions about abortion access on the ballots this year in Arkansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska and Nevada, plus a legal challenge of a court ruling that knocked a New York measure off the ballot. There’s also a push for a ballot measure in Arizona, where the state Supreme Court this year ruled that an 1864 abortion ban could be enforced. With the help of some Republicans - Democrats in the Legislature were able to repeal that law. Generally, abortion rights expand when voters are deciding. In the seven statewide abortion policy-related votes since 2022, voters have sided with abortion rights advocates in every case. The Dobbs ruling and its aftermath gave rise to a bevy of legal questions and lawsuits challenging nearly every ban and restriction. Many of those questions deal with how exceptions - which come into play far more often when abortion is barred earlier in pregnancy - should apply. The issue is often raised by those who wanted to be pregnant but who experienced life-threatening complications. A group of women who had serious pregnancy complications but were denied abortions in Texas sued, claiming the state’s ban is vague about which exceptions are allowed. The all-Republican Texas Supreme Court disagreed in a May ruling. The Supreme Court also heard arguments in April on the federal government’s lawsuit against Idaho, which says its ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy can extend to women in medical emergencies. The Biden administration says that violates federal law. A ruling on that case could be issued at any time. Meanwhile, bans have been put on hold by judges in Iowa, Montana, Utah and Wyoming.",

Most Democratic-led states have taken actions to protect abortion rights, and become sanctuaries for out-of-state patients seeking care. That’s changed the landscape of abortion access, making it more of a logistical and financial ordeal for many in conservative states. But it has not reduced the overall number of procedures done each month across the U.S. Here’s what to know about the state of abortion rights in the U.S. now. Bans in Republican-led states have prompted many people seeking abortions to travel to get care. That translates into higher costs for gas or plane tickets, hotels and meals; more logistics to figure out, including child care; and more days off work. A new study by the Guttmacher Institute, which advocates for abortion access, found that out of just over a million abortions provided in clinics, hospitals and doctors’ offices, more than 161,000 — or 16% — were for people who crossed state lines to get them. More than two-thirds of abortions done in Kansas and New Mexico were for out-of-staters, particularly Texans. Since Florida’s six-week abortion ban kicked in in May, many people had to travel farther than before, since throughout the Southeast, most states have bans. Low-income patients and those lacking legal permission to be in the country are more likely to be unable to travel. There can be lasting costs for those who do. In Alabama, the Yellowhammer Fund, which previously helped residents pay for the procedure has paused doing so since facing threats of litigation from the state. Jenice Fountain, Yellowhammer’s executive director, said she met a woman recently who traveled from Alabama to neighboring Georgia for an abortion but found she couldn’t get one there because she was slightly too far into her pregnancy. So she then went to Virginia. The journey wiped out her rent money and she needed help to remain housed. “We’re having people use every dime that they have to get out of state, or use every dime they have to have another child,” Fountain said. Nearly two-thirds of known abortions last year were provided with pills rather than procedures. One report found that pills are prescribed via telehealth and mailed to about 6,000 people a month who live in states with abortion bans. They’re sent by medical providers in states with laws intended to protect them from prosecution for those prescriptions. The laws in Colorado, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont and Washington specifically protect medical providers who prescribe the pills to patients in states with bans. The growing prominence of pills, which were used in about half of all abortions just before the Dobbs ruling, is a frontier in the latest chapter of the legal fight. The U.S. Supreme Court this month unanimously rejected an effort by abortion opponents who were seeking to overturn or roll back the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone, one of two drugs usually used together for medication abortions. The issue is likely to return. In this presidential election year, abortion is a key issue. Protecting access has emerged as a key theme in the campaigns of Democrats, including President Joe Biden in his reelection bid. Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has said states should decide whether to restrict abortions. He also suggested states could limit contraception use but changed his tune on that. “We recognize this could be the last Dobbs anniversary we celebrate,” Kelsey Pritchard, a spokesperson for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America said in an interview, noting that if Democrats win the presidency and regain control of both chambers of Congress, a right to abortion could be enshrined in the law. There’s also a push for a ballot measure in Arizona, where the state Supreme Court this year ruled that an 1864 abortion ban could be enforced. With the help of some Republicans — Democrats in the Legislature were able to repeal that law. Generally, abortion rights expand when voters are deciding. In the seven statewide abortion policy-related votes since 2022, voters have sided with abortion rights advocates in every case. The Dobbs ruling and its aftermath gave rise to a bevy of legal questions and lawsuits challenging nearly every ban and restriction. Many of those questions deal with how exceptions — which come into play far more often when abortion is barred earlier in pregnancy — should apply. The issue is often raised by those who wanted to be pregnant but who experienced life-threatening complications. A group of women who had serious pregnancy complications but were denied abortions in Texas sued, claiming the state’s ban is vague about which exceptions are allowed. The all-Republican Texas Supreme Court disagreed in a May ruling. The Supreme Court also heard arguments in April on the federal government’s lawsuit against Idaho, which says its ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy can extend to women in medical emergencies. The Biden administration says that violates federal law. A ruling on that case could be issued at any time. Meanwhile, bans have been put on hold by judges in Iowa, Montana, Utah and Wyoming.",

The journey wiped out her rent money and she needed help to remain housed. “We’re having people use every dime that they have to get out of state, or use every dime they have to have another child,” Fountain said. Nearly two-thirds of known abortions last year were provided with pills rather than procedures. One report found that pills are prescribed via telehealth and mailed to about 6,000 people a month who live in states with abortion bans. They’re sent by medical providers in states with laws intended to protect them from prosecution for those prescriptions. The laws in Colorado, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont and Washington specifically protect medical providers who prescribe the pills to patients in states with bans. The growing prominence of pills, which were used in about half of all abortions just before the Dobbs ruling, is a frontier in the latest chapter of the legal fight. The U.S. Supreme Court this month unanimously rejected an effort by abortion opponents who were seeking to overturn or roll back the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone, one of two drugs usually used together for medication abortions. The issue is likely to return. In this presidential election year, abortion is a key issue. Protecting access has emerged as a key theme in the campaigns of Democrats, including President Joe Biden in his reelection bid. Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has said states should decide whether to restrict abortions. He also suggested states could limit contraception use but changed his tune on that. “We recognize this could be the last Dobbs anniversary we celebrate,” Kelsey Pritchard, a spokesperson for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America said in an interview, noting that if Democrats win the presidency and regain control of both chambers of Congress, a right to abortion could be enshrined in the law. There’s also a push for a ballot measure in Arizona, where the state Supreme Court this year ruled that an 1864 abortion ban could be enforced. With the help of some Republicans — Democrats in the Legislature were able to repeal that law. Generally, abortion rights expand when voters are deciding. In the seven statewide abortion policy-related votes since 2022, voters have sided with abortion rights advocates in every case. The Dobbs ruling and its aftermath gave rise to a bevy of legal questions and lawsuits challenging nearly every ban and restriction. Many of those questions deal with how exceptions — which come into play far more often when abortion is barred earlier in pregnancy — should apply. The issue is often raised by those who wanted to be pregnant but who experienced life-threatening complications. A group of women who had serious pregnancy complications but were denied abortions in Texas sued, claiming the state’s ban is vague about which exceptions are allowed. The all-Republican Texas Supreme Court disagreed in a May ruling. The Supreme Court also heard arguments in April on the federal government’s lawsuit against Idaho, which says its ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy can extend to women in medical emergencies. The Biden administration says that violates federal law. A ruling on that case could be issued at any time. Meanwhile, bans have been put on hold by judges in Iowa, Montana, Utah and Wyoming.",

                    "text": "MIAMI (AP) — Former President Donald Trump said in an interview posted on Thursday he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges, a sharp departure from the anti-immigrant rhetoric he typically uses on the campaign trail. Trump was asked about plans for companies to be able to import the “best and brightest” in a podcast taped Wednesday with venture capitalists and tech investors called the “All-In.” “What I want to do and what I will do is you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically as part of your diploma a green card to be able to stay in this country. And that includes junior colleges too, anybody graduates from a college. You go there for two years or four years,” he said, vowing to address this concern on day one. Immigration has been Trump’s signature issue during his 2024 bid to return to the White House. His suggestion that he would offer green cards — documents that confer a pathway to U.S. citizenship — to potentially hundreds of thousands of foreign graduates would represent a sweeping expansion of America’s immigration system that sharply diverges from his most common messages on foreigners. Trump has blamed immigrants who are in the country illegally for committing crimes, stealing jobs and government resources, and suggested that they are “poisoning the blood of our country.” He has promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history if elected. Trump and his allies often say they distinguish between people entering illegally versus legally. But during his administration, Trump also proposed curbs on legal immigration such as family-based visas and the visa lottery program. Right after taking office in 2017, he issued his “Buy American and Hire American” executive order, directing Cabinet members to suggest reforms to ensure that business visas were only awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers. He has previously said the H1-B program commonly used by companies to hire foreign workers temporarily — a program he has used in the past — was “very bad” and used by tech companies to get foreign workers for lower pay. During the conversation with “All-In,” Trump blamed the coronavirus pandemic for being unable to implement these measures while he was president. He said he knows of stories of people who graduate from top colleges and want to stay in the U.S. but can’t secure visas to do so, forcing them to return to their native countries, specifically naming India and China. He said they go on and become multibillionaires, employing thousands of workers. “You need a pool of people to work for your company,” Trump said. “And they have to be smart people.

They do the same basic company in those places and they become multi billionaires employing thousands and thousands of people,\" Trump said.He also said that US companies need \"smart people,\" adding \"they can't even make a deal with a company because they don't think they're going to be able to stay in the country.\"\"That is going to end on day one,\" Trump added.During Trump's 2017-2021 presidency, he ordered construction of a wall on the US-Mexico border and implemented a travel ban on people from mostly Muslim countries.His comments came after Democrat opponent Biden on Tuesday relaxed visa rules for around half a million spouses of US nationals, making it easier for them to obtain citizenship.The president also simplified the process for migrants who came to the United States illegally as children -- known as \"Dreamers\" -- to get work visas if they've graduated college and have a \"high-skilled job offer.\"Biden -- often accused of being soft on immigration by Republicans -- earlier in June signed an executive order barring migrants who enter the United States illegally from claiming asylum when numbers surge past 2,500 in a day.",

                    "text": "Former President Donald Trump proposed “automatically” giving green cards to foreign nationals who graduate from a US college – comments that break from his efforts to curb both legal and illegal immigration while in office and stand in stark contrast to his inflammatory anti-immigrant rhetoric on the campaign trail. “What I want to do, and what I will do, is you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,” the presumptive GOP nominee said on “The All-In Podcast,” which aired Thursday. He continued, “And that includes junior colleges too. Anybody graduates from a college — you go in there for two years or four years. If you graduate, or you get a doctorate degree from a college, you should be able to stay in this country.” Trump made the comments on a podcast whose hosts included prominent tech venture capitalists David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya, who recently hosted a fundraiser for Trump in San Francisco. Trump was responding to another one of the podcast hosts, investor Jason Calacanis, who asked the former president, “Can you please promise us you will give us more ability to import the best and brightest from around the world to America?” Trump has made immigration a central focus of his 2024 bid for the White House, promising to carry out “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history” and using the issue to attack President Joe Biden’s leadership. His latest comments come after Biden earlier this week announced an executive action allowing certain undocumented spouses and children of US citizens to apply for lawful permanent residency without leaving the country. The election-year move from the president, intended to appeal to key Latino voters in battleground states, followed a more restrictive action earlier this month to limit asylum processing at the US southern border. Trump on the podcast complained that some foreign graduates of top US colleges cannot start companies in the US and instead found their companies in other countries like India or China. “You need a pool of people to work for your companies and they have to be smart people. … You need brilliant people and we force the brilliant people, the people that graduate from college, the people that are number one in their class from the best colleges. You have to be able to recruit these people and keep the people,” the former president said. Trump’s remarks are at odds with his efforts to limit immigration when he was in the White House, including targeting visa programs that tech companies use to bring in thousands of skilled workers and directing federal agencies to employ what he called a “Buy American, Hire American” strategy to promote the hiring of American workers. Trump also tried to restrict refugee resettlement and temporarily banned travel from seven Muslim majority countries while in office. In his third presidential run, Trump regularly stokes fears about undocumented migrants, claiming without evidence the vast majority are violent criminals as he rails against Biden’s immigration policies. His language – including saying that undocumented immigrants were “poisoning the blood of our country” – has often drawn rebuke from his opponent’s campaign.

He believes, only after such vetting has taken place, we ought to keep the most skilled graduates who can make significant contributions to America.

The Republican candidate made the remarks in a podcast published Thursday, days after President Joe Biden announced a citizenship pathway for immigrants married to US nationals, counterbalancing his recent crackdown on illegal border crossings. \"What I want to do and what I will do is, you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically as part of your diploma a green card to be able to stay in this country,\" Trump told the All-In podcast. A green card is the commonly used name for a permanent resident card in the United States and a step toward citizenship. Trump said this should include \"anybody who graduates from a college,\" including those who complete two-year programs, known as junior colleges, and doctoral graduates. Asked initially on the podcast if he would promise to help import the \"best and the brightest around the world to America,\" Trump replied: \"I do promise.\" He added: \"I know of stories where people graduated from a top college, or from a college, and they desperately want to stay here... and they can't. \"They go back to India, they go back to China. They do the same basic company in those places and they become multi billionaires employing thousands and thousands of people,\" Trump said. He also said that US companies need \"smart people,\" adding \"they can't even make a deal with a company because they don't think they're going to be able to stay in the country.\" \"That is going to end on day one,\" Trump added. During Trump's 2017-2021 presidency, he ordered construction of a wall on the US-Mexico border and implemented a travel ban on people from mostly Muslim countries. His comments came after Democrat opponent Biden on Tuesday relaxed visa rules for around half a million spouses of US nationals, making it easier for them to obtain citizenship. The president also simplified the process for migrants who came to the United States illegally as children -- known as \"Dreamers\" -- to get work visas if they've graduated college and have a \"high-skilled job offer.\" Biden -- often accused of being soft on immigration by Republicans -- earlier in June signed an executive order barring migrants who enter the United States illegally from claiming asylum when numbers surge past 2,500 in a day.",

                    "text": "The H-1B visa about-face: \"What I want to do and what I will do is, you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country,\" former President Donald Trump told The All-In Podcast. \"And that includes junior colleges, too. Anybody graduates from a college, you go in there for two years or four years. If you graduate or you get a doctorate degree from a college, you should be able to stay in this country.\" One of the podcast's co-hosts had asked him to \"promise\" to give people like them (venture capitalists and entrepreneurs) \"more ability to import the best and brightest around the world to America.\" \"I know of stories where people graduated…from a college, and they desperately wanted to stay here,\" Trump continued. \"They had a plan for a company, or a concept, and they can't. They go back to India, they go back to China. They do the same basic company in those places, and they become multibillionaires, employing thousands and thousands of people. And it could have been done here.\" \"You need a pool of people to work for your companies,\" he added. \"You have great companies, and they have to be smart people. You have to be able to recruit these people and keep the people. Somebody graduates at the top of the class, they can't even make a deal with a company because they don't think they're going to be able to stay in the country. That is going to end on Day One.\" What Trump is articulating about high-skilled workers, and the H-1B visas they are eligible for, is not just sensible but also something immigration proponents have been saying for a long time. The idea that he'll focus on this as a policy priority strains credulity, given that this is the man who hired notorious restrictionist Stephen Miller as one of his top immigration advisers during his first term. (Miller, \"best known for his role in implementing a 'zero tolerance' policy at the Mexican border, in which migrant parents were systematically separated from their children as part of a deterrence strategy,\" writes Reason's Billy Binion, was the architect of some of Trump's most cruel and haphazard policies that worsened the already-convoluted immigration system.) It's especially funny that his spokesperson attempted to walk much of Trump's comments back, leaving would-be voters even more confused as to what the administration might choose to prioritize. Donor management: In some sense, this is the most predictable tale of all time: A politician tells donors exactly what they want to hear, and it's questionable whether he'll actually do anything based on this. For the unfamiliar, The All-In Podcast is comprised of venture capitalists—Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, David Sacks—and entrepreneur David Friedberg, who range from politically Trump-curious (but not sold) to donor-supporters, like Sacks, who just hosted a Trump fundraiser at his home in San Francisco at which Trump purportedly raised $12 million. Other Silicon Valley folks, like Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who claimed Mark Zuckerberg stole the idea for Facebook from them (and sued over it) during their college days, have come out of the political closet in the last few days and publicly pledged donations to Trump. A seemingly related headline: \"Trump has rapidly eroded Biden's edge in 2024 cash battle.\" Whether these Silicon Valley donors buy what Trump is selling—that he's interested in helping America prevent brain drain to China and India—is debatable, but it's clear that currying favor with these folks is having a positive outcome for Team Trump. As for the All-In guys, the whole interview is worth a watch since the crew eschews the apoplectic tone used by much of the media. The end result is better for it, and certainly more useful to the viewer. It's yet another example of how the traditional media fumbled the ball during the 2016 election and subsequent Trump years, failing to self-correct, and how media-class incuriousness has led to a worse quality product. Of course, All-In has its own problems—they're playing the role of journalists, but Sacks is himself a Trump donor, and there's a sycophantic attitude toward the former president at times—but at least their cards have been laid on the table. Compare that to a media class that sometimes pretends it's not disproportionately liberal but won't tell you who they voted for (the way Reason journalists do). Partisanship does not mean you can't do good journalism, but journalists sometimes delude themselves into thinking that hiding their political affiliation results in objectivity or somehow prevents bias from seeping in.

                    "text": "Despite facing friendly fire from so-called national conservatives over a recent interview with the venture capitalists on the All-In podcast, former President Donald Trump’s latest insistence that foreign students be compelled to stay in the country after attending an American college exemplifies the former president’s pro-growth strain of “America First.” “What I want to do and what I will do it: you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country, and that includes junior colleges too — anybody who graduates from a college,” the presumptive Republican nominee said on the podcast. “We need brilliant people.” Cue the primal scream from protectionist identitarians who wrongly mistook Trump for an ethno-socialist in mere capitalist clothing. Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt correctly maintained that Trump’s proposal would “only apply to the most thoroughly vetted college graduates” and, in idiosyncratic fashion, “exclude all communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters,” and the like. But even without the appeal to pathos, this proposal is patently populist if the end goal is to advance the American project and deny our enemies our greatest asset: intelligence. Under our current system, evenly ostensibly private universities manage to milk taxpayers for cash, not just directly through student grants and research funding, but much more substantially through the federalized and uncapped student loan system that allows these supposed non-profits to set prices at higher and higher prices. Yet the greatest cash cow for colleges comes from abroad, where children of Chinese Communist Party apparatchiks and Saudi oligarchs pay an even higher list price of tuition than domestic students. If we are going to continue to allow both private and public universities to exclude American applicants in favor of foreign ones — and if those foreign students genuinely do demonstrate greater raw merit than American competitors rather than extra cash and diversity points for admissions brochures, that seems fair enough — then foreign students should not just be vetted before gaining entrance to our ivory towers and all of its lucrative secrets accordingly; those students should be compelled to stay. Why should we allow CCP scions to spend half a decade learning artificial intelligence from the Big Tech alumni who created contemporary machine learning, only to go back to work for Xi Jinping in diametric opposition to American interests? Why would we want a Saudi student to receive the best petroleum engineering education on the planet with the immediate consequence of being employed by OPEC instead of helping Americans undercut the post-Soviet cartel? While the national conservatives seeking to hijack the “intellectualized” Trump movement, Trump himself understands the real human capital required to create great American growth better than any think tank wonk in Washington who has deluded himself into believing he’s a man of the people. The fact is that the best and the brightest immigrants from abroad — in direct contrast to the criminal hoards currently invading the Southern border — are indeed those who have made America great. According to polling from the Economic Innovation Group, the overwhelming majority of Republicans and Americans overall agree with this general sentiment. “60% of voters overall and 89% of GOP voters agree with Trump’s call for a ‘big, beautiful door’ — pairing tough border politics with a welcoming legal immigration system for those who can contribute to our economy,” the Group finds. Furthermore, a permanent influx of legal, law-abiding, and highly skilled immigrants is a solution to the correct economic problem. As was true in 2019, the unemployment rate is around a half-century low and, as evidence that we have achieved full employment, is staying there. But in 2024, that full employment is more a weapon against the working class than an asset. The job vacancy to unemployment ratio has remained around its lowest level of the entire century thus far, and as Social Security races towards insolvency in the next decade, the ratio of workers to each beneficiary they’re forced to bankroll is shrinking from three to two. An expanded, high-skilled workforce of people who are thankful to be here provides modest but quantifiable relief both in the balance of the shrinking class of “makers” giving increasing amounts of money to an aging and expanding class of “takers” and with regards to inflation, which has been exacerbated by the labor shortage. Of course, all this goes without saying that even without Trump’s proposal, Leavitt’s caveat should be imposed on Day One of a second Trump administration because the status quo is dangerously lax toward student visa applicants. Our F-1 visa program approves roughly four out of every five applicants, but it’s also extremely generous towards our foreign adversaries, and prior to the pandemic, Chinese nationals received more than a quarter-million (or plurality) of the hundreds of thousands of F-1 visas approved. Nearly 5,000 Russians obtained F-1 visas, and Iranians received more than 1,000. At 74,831, Indian nationals receive the second-highest number of student visas, and at 28,171, Saudi Arabia obtains the third. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Despite the fact that our H1-B work visa approval rate is as high as our student visa rate, students from nations that hate America tend to return to their home countries instead of attempting to work here. Eight in 10 Chinese nationals who study abroad return to China, and a jarring report by ProPublica has revealed that Saudi diplomats are smuggling home Saudi students in America charged with crimes as grievous as rape and manslaughter. As evidenced by scores of college campuses overran by cheerleaders for Hamas demanding we “globalize the Intifada” and genocide the Jews, our universities have become breeding grounds for the sort of terrorist sentiment ISIS and the Taliban could only dream of exporting to America. But a better vetting process for foreign students should be coupled by allowing, if not insisting, that we keep the best and the brightest for American interests and America first.",

                    "title": "What Trump's proposal to exclude tips from taxes could mean for workers",
                    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Donald Trump’s new proposal to exclude tips from federal taxes is getting strong reviews from some Republican lawmakers, though major questions remain about the impact of the policy and how it would work. What’s certain is that a change in the taxation of tips would affect millions. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates there are 2.24 million waiters and waitresses across the country, with tips making up a large percentage of their income. A look at what Trump’s proposing and the possible political and economic ramifications: TRUMP’S ELECTION-YEAR PITCH IN NEVADA Trump announced his tax-free-tips plan at a June 9 rally in Nevada, a key battleground state with six electoral votes in the race for the White House. President Joe Biden won the state in 2020, but the Trump campaign hopes to put the state in play this fall. Nevada has the highest concentration of tipped workers in the country, with about 25.8 waiters and waitresses per 1,000 jobs, followed by Hawaii and Florida. “To those hotel workers and people who get tips, you are going to be very happy, because when I get to office we are going to not charge taxes on tips, people making tips,” Trump said at the rally. “... We’re going to do that right away, first thing in office.” The pitch sets up a sharp political contrast between Democrats and Republicans. While Trump assumes that a tax cut would help workers, Democrats have generally endorsed efforts to increase hourly wages — and it’s an open question which approach resonates more with voters. The Culinary Union, which represents 60,000 workers in Las Vegas and Reno and is backing Biden, dismissed Trump’s plan as a stunt. “Relief is definitely needed for tip earners, but Nevada workers are smart enough to know the difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon.” Culinary Union Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said in a statement. Lael Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council, declined to speak to the idea floated by Trump because, as a federal employee, she’s not supposed to talk campaign politics. “What I can say is that President Biden has fought for real solutions that actually address workers’ legitimate need for fair wages, we think, much more effectively,” she said, adding that tipped workers in Nevada would get a $6,000 income boost from a higher minimum wage and the elimination of the tipped minimum wage. HOW WOULD THE TAX EXEMPTION WORK? Trump has not specified whether he wants to exempt tips from just income taxes or from the payroll tax as well. The payroll tax funds Medicare and Social Security. For workers, a blanket exemption would mean more take-home pay. And for the federal government, it could mean larger budget deficits. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group, has estimated that exempting tips from both income and payroll taxes would reduce federal revenues by $150 billion to $250 billion over the next decade. The committee said exempting tips from taxation would also lead employers and workers to reclassify wages as tips where possible. The more that happens, the more that federal deficits would increase. A 10% increase in tips, for example, would bump up the committee’s projection for lost federal revenue to a range of $165 billion to $275 billion over the next decade. Congress undoubtedly would examine Trump’s proposal on tips as it considers which portions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are allowed to expire after next year, including the lower individual tax rates. Lawmakers are already prepping for the task, though Trump’s proposal is something that many had not thought about until recently. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., a senior House Ways and Means Committee member, said lawmakers will have to consider the overall cost of the tips proposal and how to pay for it. “I want to be sensitive because they work hard, you can’t find enough waiters, and obviously a big part of their earnings is tips,” Buchanan said. “All these programs sound good. Everybody would like to pay less taxes, but we’ve got to pay the bills.” “I know he’s trying to make sure the people at that income level have relief as much as possible. We might be able to do the same thing in making his tax cuts more permanent and more likely to address lower-income people,” said Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., who also serves on the Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over tax policy. TRADE-OFFS OF NOT TAXING TIPS Like many tax proposals, Trump’s push to exempt tips could have unintended consequences. Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, argues that Trump’s proposal could actually backfire for many tipped workers. For example, some customers may respond to tax-free tips by reducing their gratuity. Secondly, it could take the steam out of efforts in some states to gradually increase the minimum wage for tipped workers so that their base pay is in line with the minimum wage for other workers. “The lure of tax-free income could turn many workers against the shift from tips to wages,” Gleckman wrote in a blog post. Gleckman also questioned why a service worker should avoid paying taxes on tips as opposed to a warehouse worker earning the same amount. He noted that while Trump promised to repeal the tax on tips right away, only Congress can repeal federal taxes, and “for reasons of efficiency, fairness, and sound tax administration, let’s hope it doesn’t.” LOOKING AHEAD Democrats have largely dismissed Trump’s proposal as a gimmick to win over voters. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, noted she was a waitress in college, calling it “really hard work.” She prefers increasing the minimum wage for tipped workers to match the minimum wage for other workers. “From my perspective, I don’t think (Trump’s) proposal is serious and I don’t think it does enough to address low-wage working people,” Stabenow said. Sen. Ron Wyden, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said Trump was “throwing out lots of ideas as he goes,” but his record as president reflects an emphasis on tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations. “All these things he throws out every day, I’ll believe it when I see it,” Wyden said. But Trump’s enthusiasm for the idea seems to be growing. The tax promise has since become a staple of Trump’s rallies and meetings, and he raised his proposal while meeting with GOP lawmakers and business leaders in Washington last week. “I think it’s actually a very smart idea. The men and women who rely on tips for their earnings, they are working their tails off,” said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. “That’s very good, targeted tax reform right there.” Some lawmakers and allies have begun tweeting photos of their restaurant bills with handwritten messages designed to spread the word about Trump’s promise. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., wrote “Vote Trump!” and “No Tax on tips!” on his bill from a Milwaukee restaurant.

                    "title": "Trump proposed excluding tips from federal taxes.  Here’s what that would mean for workers’ take-home pay—and budget deficits",
                    "text": "What’s certain is that a change in the taxation of tips would affect millions. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates there are 2.24 million waiters and waitresses across the country, with tips making up a large percentage of their income. A look at what Trump’s proposing and the possible political and economic ramifications: Trump’s election-year pitch in Nevada Trump announced his tax-free-tips plan at a June 9 rally in Nevada, a key battleground state with six electoral votes in the race for the White House. President Joe Biden won the state in 2020, but the Trump campaign hopes to put the state in play this fall. Nevada has the highest concentration of tipped workers in the country, with about 25.8 waiters and waitresses per 1,000 jobs, followed by Hawaii and Florida. “To those hotel workers and people who get tips, you are going to be very happy, because when I get to office we are going to not charge taxes on tips, people making tips,” Trump said at the rally. “… We’re going to do that right away, first thing in office.” The pitch sets up a sharp political contrast between Democrats and Republicans. While Trump assumes that a tax cut would help workers, Democrats have generally endorsed efforts to increase hourly wages — and it’s an open question which approach resonates more with voters. The Culinary Union, which represents 60,000 workers in Las Vegas and Reno and is backing Biden, dismissed Trump’s plan as a stunt. “Relief is definitely needed for tip earners, but Nevada workers are smart enough to know the difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon.” Culinary Union Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said in a statement. Lael Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council, declined to speak to the idea floated by Trump because, as a federal employee, she’s not supposed to talk campaign politics. “What I can say is that President Biden has fought for real solutions that actually address workers’ legitimate need for fair wages, we think, much more effectively,” she said, adding that tipped workers in Nevada would get a $6,000 income boost from a higher minimum wage and the elimination of the tipped minimum wage. How would the tax exemption work? Trump has not specified whether he wants to exempt tips from just income taxes or from the payroll tax as well. The payroll tax funds Medicare and Social Security. For workers, a blanket exemption would mean more take-home pay. And for the federal government, it could mean larger budget deficits. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group, has estimated that exempting tips from both income and payroll taxes would reduce federal revenues by $150 billion to $250 billion over the next decade. The committee said exempting tips from taxation would also lead employers and workers to reclassify wages as tips where possible. The more that happens, the more that federal deficits would increase. A 10% increase in tips, for example, would bump up the committee’s projection for lost federal revenue to a range of $165 billion to $275 billion over the next decade. Congress undoubtedly would examine Trump’s proposal on tips as it considers which portions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are allowed to expire after next year, including the lower individual tax rates. Lawmakers are already prepping for the task, though Trump’s proposal is something that many had not thought about until recently. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., a senior House Ways and Means Committee member, said lawmakers will have to consider the overall cost of the tips proposal and how to pay for it. “I want to be sensitive because they work hard, you can’t find enough waiters, and obviously a big part of their earnings is tips,” Buchanan said. “All these programs sound good. Everybody would like to pay less taxes, but we’ve got to pay the bills.” “I know he’s trying to make sure the people at that income level have relief as much as possible. We might be able to do the same thing in making his tax cuts more permanent and more likely to address lower-income people,” said Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., who also serves on the Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over tax policy. Trade-offs of not taxing tips Like many tax proposals, Trump’s push to exempt tips could have unintended consequences. Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, argues that Trump’s proposal could actually backfire for many tipped workers. For example, some customers may respond to tax-free tips by reducing their gratuity. Secondly, it could take the steam out of efforts in some states to gradually increase the minimum wage for tipped workers so that their base pay is in line with the minimum wage for other workers. “The lure of tax-free income could turn many workers against the shift from tips to wages,” Gleckman wrote in a blog post. Gleckman also questioned why a service worker should avoid paying taxes on tips as opposed to a warehouse worker earning the same amount. He noted that while Trump promised to repeal the tax on tips right away, only Congress can repeal federal taxes, and “for reasons of efficiency, fairness, and sound tax administration, let’s hope it doesn’t.” Looking ahead Democrats have largely dismissed Trump’s proposal as a gimmick to win over voters. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, noted she was a waitress in college, calling it “really hard work.” She prefers increasing the minimum wage for tipped workers to match the minimum wage for other workers. “From my perspective, I don’t think (Trump’s) proposal is serious and I don’t think it does enough to address low-wage working people,” Stabenow said. Sen. Ron Wyden, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said Trump was “throwing out lots of ideas as he goes,” but his record as president reflects an emphasis on tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations. “All these things he throws out every day, I’ll believe it when I see it,” Wyden said. But Trump’s enthusiasm for the idea seems to be growing. The tax promise has since become a staple of Trump’s rallies and meetings, and he raised his proposal while meeting with GOP lawmakers and business leaders in Washington last week. “I think it’s actually a very smart idea. The men and women who rely on tips for their earnings, they are working their tails off,” said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. “That’s very good, targeted tax reform right there.” Some lawmakers and allies have begun tweeting photos of their restaurant bills with handwritten messages designed to spread the word about Trump’s promise. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., wrote “Vote Trump!” and “No Tax on tips!” on his bill from a Milwaukee restaurant. The musician Kid Rock, a prominent Trump supporter, shared a photo on X. “A vote for Trump is a vote for no tax on tips!!” he wrote on his receipt. He tipped $400 on a $1,143 bill at a pricey steakhouse, according to the photo.",

Lael Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council, declined to speak to the idea floated by Trump because, as a federal employee, she’s not supposed to talk campaign politics. “What I can say is that President Biden has fought for real solutions that actually address workers’ legitimate need for fair wages, we think, much more effectively,” she said, adding that tipped workers in Nevada would get a $6,000 income boost from a higher minimum wage and the elimination of the tipped minimum wage. HOW WOULD THE TAX EXEMPTION WORK? Trump has not specified whether he wants to exempt tips from just income taxes or from the payroll tax as well. The payroll tax funds Medicare and Social Security. For workers, a blanket exemption would mean more take-home pay. And for the federal government, it could mean larger budget deficits. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group, has estimated that exempting tips from both income and payroll taxes would reduce federal revenues by $150 billion to $250 billion over the next decade. The committee said exempting tips from taxation would also lead employers and workers to reclassify wages as tips where possible. The more that happens, the more that federal deficits would increase. A 10% increase in tips, for example, would bump up the committee’s projection for lost federal revenue to a range of $165 billion to $275 billion over the next decade. Congress undoubtedly would examine Trump’s proposal on tips as it considers which portions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are allowed to expire after next year, including the lower individual tax rates. Lawmakers are already prepping for the task, though Trump’s proposal is something that many had not thought about until recently. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., a senior House Ways and Means Committee member, said lawmakers will have to consider the overall cost of the tips proposal and how to pay for it. “I want to be sensitive because they work hard, you can’t find enough waiters, and obviously a big part of their earnings is tips,” Buchanan said. “All these programs sound good. Everybody would like to pay less taxes, but we’ve got to pay the bills.” “I know he’s trying to make sure the people at that income level have relief as much as possible. We might be able to do the same thing in making his tax cuts more permanent and more likely to address lower-income people,” said Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., who also serves on the Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over tax policy. TRADE-OFFS OF NOT TAXING TIPS Like many tax proposals, Trump’s push to exempt tips could have unintended consequences. Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, argues that Trump’s proposal could actually backfire for many tipped workers. For example, some customers may respond to tax-free tips by reducing their gratuity. Secondly, it could take the steam out of efforts in some states to gradually increase the minimum wage for tipped workers so that their base pay is in line with the minimum wage for other workers. “The lure of tax-free income could turn many workers against the shift from tips to wages,” Gleckman wrote in a blog post. Gleckman also questioned why a service worker should avoid paying taxes on tips as opposed to a warehouse worker earning the same amount. He noted that while Trump promised to repeal the tax on tips right away, only Congress can repeal federal taxes, and “for reasons of efficiency, fairness, and sound tax administration, let’s hope it doesn’t.” LOOKING AHEAD Democrats have largely dismissed Trump’s proposal as a gimmick to win over voters. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, noted she was a waitress in college, calling it “really hard work.” She prefers increasing the minimum wage for tipped workers to match the minimum wage for other workers. “From my perspective, I don’t think (Trump’s) proposal is serious and I don’t think it does enough to address low-wage working people,” Stabenow said. Sen. Ron Wyden, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said Trump was “throwing out lots of ideas as he goes,” but his record as president reflects an emphasis on tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations. “All these things he throws out every day, I’ll believe it when I see it,” Wyden said. But Trump’s enthusiasm for the idea seems to be growing. The tax promise has since become a staple of Trump’s rallies and meetings, and he raised his proposal while meeting with GOP lawmakers and business leaders in Washington last week. “I think it’s actually a very smart idea. The men and women who rely on tips for their earnings, they are working their tails off,” said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. “That’s very good, targeted tax reform right there.” Some lawmakers and allies have begun tweeting photos of their restaurant bills with handwritten messages designed to spread the word about Trump’s promise. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., wrote “Vote Trump!” and “No Tax on tips!” on his bill from a Milwaukee restaurant. The musician Kid Rock, a prominent Trump supporter, shared a photo on X. “A vote for Trump is a vote for no tax on tips!!” he wrote on his receipt. He tipped $400 on a $1,143 bill at a pricey steakhouse, according to the photo. Associated Press writer Jonathan J. Cooper in Phoenix contributed to this report.",

                    "text": "By KEVIN FREKING and JOSH BOAK (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Donald Trump’s new proposal to exclude tips from federal taxes is getting strong reviews from some Republican lawmakers, though major questions remain about the impact of the policy and how it would work.

A look at what Trump’s proposing and the possible political and economic ramifications: TRUMP’S ELECTION-YEAR PITCH IN NEVADA Trump announced his tax-free-tips plan at a June 9 rally in Nevada, a key battleground state with six electoral votes in the race for the White House.

                    "text": "By KEVIN FREKING and JOSH BOAK (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Donald Trump’s new proposal to exclude tips from federal taxes is getting strong reviews from some Republican lawmakers, though major questions remain about the impact of the policy and how it would work. What’s certain is that a change in the taxation of tips would affect millions. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates there are 2.24 million waiters and waitresses across the country, with tips making up a large percentage of their income. A look at what Trump’s proposing and the possible political and economic ramifications: TRUMP’S ELECTION-YEAR PITCH IN NEVADA Trump announced his tax-free-tips plan at a June 9 rally in Nevada, a key battleground state with six electoral votes in the race for the White House. President Joe Biden won the state in 2020, but the Trump campaign hopes to put the state in play this fall. Nevada has the highest concentration of tipped workers in the country, with about 25.8 waiters and waitresses per 1,000 jobs, followed by Hawaii and Florida. “To those hotel workers and people who get tips, you are going to be very happy, because when I get to office we are going to not charge taxes on tips, people making tips,” Trump said at the rally. “… We’re going to do that right away, first thing in office.” The Culinary Union, which represents 60,000 workers in Las Vegas and Reno and is backing Biden, dismissed Trump’s plan as a stunt. “Relief is definitely needed for tip earners, but Nevada workers are smart enough to know the difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon.” Culinary Union Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said in a statement. Lael Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council, declined to speak to the idea floated by Trump because, as a federal employee, she’s not supposed to talk campaign politics. “What I can say is that President Biden has fought for real solutions that actually address workers’ legitimate need for fair wages, we think, much more effectively,” she said, adding that tipped workers in Nevada would get a $6,000 income boost from a higher minimum wage and the elimination of the tipped minimum wage. HOW WOULD THE TAX EXEMPTION WORK? Trump has not specified whether he wants to exempt tips from just income taxes or from the payroll tax as well. The payroll tax funds Medicare and Social Security. For workers, a blanket exemption would mean more take-home pay. And for the federal government, it could mean larger budget deficits. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group, has estimated that exempting tips from both income and payroll taxes would reduce federal revenues by $150 billion to $250 billion over the next decade. The committee said exempting tips from taxation would also lead employers and workers to reclassify wages as tips where possible. The more that happens, the more that federal deficits would increase. A 10% increase in tips, for example, would bump up the committee’s projection for lost federal revenue to a range of $165 billion to $275 billion over the next decade. Congress undoubtedly would examine Trump’s proposal on tips as it considers which portions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are allowed to expire after next year, including the lower individual tax rates. Lawmakers are already prepping for the task, though Trump’s proposal is something that many had not thought about until recently. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., a senior House Ways and Means Committee member, said lawmakers will have to consider the overall cost of the tips proposal and how to pay for it. “I want to be sensitive because they work hard, you can’t find enough waiters, and obviously a big part of their earnings is tips,” Buchanan said. “All these programs sound good. Everybody would like to pay less taxes, but we’ve got to pay the bills.” “I know he’s trying to make sure the people at that income level have relief as much as possible. We might be able to do the same thing in making his tax cuts more permanent and more likely to address lower-income people,” said Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., who also serves on the Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over tax policy. TRADE-OFFS OF NOT TAXING TIPS Like many tax proposals, Trump’s push to exempt tips could have unintended consequences. Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, argues that Trump’s proposal could actually backfire for many tipped workers. For example, some customers may respond to tax-free tips by reducing their gratuity. Secondly, it could take the steam out of efforts in some states to gradually increase the minimum wage for tipped workers so that their base pay is in line with the minimum wage for other workers. “The lure of tax-free income could turn many workers against the shift from tips to wages,” Gleckman wrote in a blog post. Gleckman also questioned why a service worker should avoid paying taxes on tips as opposed to a warehouse worker earning the same amount. He noted that while Trump promised to repeal the tax on tips right away, only Congress can repeal federal taxes, and “for reasons of efficiency, fairness, and sound tax administration, let’s hope it doesn’t.” LOOKING AHEAD Democrats have largely dismissed Trump’s proposal as a gimmick to win over voters. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, noted she was a waitress in college, calling it “really hard work.” She prefers increasing the minimum wage for tipped workers to match the minimum wage for other workers. “From my perspective, I don’t think (Trump’s) proposal is serious and I don’t think it does enough to address low-wage working people,” Stabenow said. Sen. Ron Wyden, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said Trump was “throwing out lots of ideas as he goes,” but his record as president reflects an emphasis on tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations. “All these things he throws out every day, I’ll believe it when I see it,” Wyden said. But Trump’s enthusiasm for the idea seems to be growing. The tax promise has since become a staple of Trump’s rallies and meetings, and he raised his proposal while meeting with GOP lawmakers and business leaders in Washington last week. “I think it’s actually a very smart idea. The men and women who rely on tips for their earnings, they are working their tails off,” said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. “That’s very good, targeted tax reform right there.” Some lawmakers and allies have begun tweeting photos of their restaurant bills with handwritten messages designed to spread the word about Trump’s promise. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., wrote “Vote Trump!” and “No Tax on tips!” on his bill from a Milwaukee restaurant. The musician Kid Rock, a prominent Trump supporter, shared a photo on X. “A vote for Trump is a vote for no tax on tips!!” he wrote on his receipt. He tipped $400 on a $1,143 bill at a pricey steakhouse, according to the photo. Associated Press writer Jonathan J. Cooper in Phoenix contributed to this report.",

                    "text": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli forces shelled tent camps for displaced Palestinians north of Rafah on Friday, killing at least 25 people and wounding another 50 according to Gaza’s Heath Ministry and emergency workers, in the latest deadly attack in the tiny Palestinian territory where hundreds of thousands have fled fighting between Israel and Hamas. According to Ahmed Radwan, a spokesperson for the Civil Defense first responders in Rafah, witnesses told rescue workers about the shelling at two locations in a coastal area that has become filled with tents. The Health Ministry reported the number of people killed and wounded in the attacks. The locations of the attacks provided by Civil Defense were just outside an Israeli-designated safe zone. The Israeli military said they were looking into the strikes at the reported coordinates. Israel has previously bombed locations in the vicinity of the “humanitarian zone” in Muwasi, a rural area on the Mediterranean coast that has filled with sprawling tent camps in recent months. The strikes came as Israel pushed ahead with its military operation in Rafah, where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge from fighting elsewhere in Gaza. Most have now fled Rafah, but the United Nations says no place in Gaza is safe and humanitarian conditions are dire as families shelter in tents and cramped apartments without adequate food, water, or medical supplies. Friday’s strikes took place less than a month after an Israeli bombing triggered a deadly fire that tore through a camp for displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza, drawing widespread international outrage — including from some of Israel’s closest allies — over the military’s expanding offensive into Rafah. Israel says it is targeting Hamas fighters and infrastructure and that it tries to minimize civilian deaths. It blames the large number of civilian casualties on fighters and says it’s because they operate among the population. With Israel’s war against Hamas now in its ninth month, international criticism is growing over Israel’s campaign of systematic destruction in Gaza, at a huge cost in civilian lives. The top United Nations court has concluded there is a “plausible risk of genocide ” in Gaza — a charge Israel strongly denies. Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 37,100 people in Gaza, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Israel launched the war after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, in which fighters stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250.",

                    "text": "By WAFAA SHURAFA (Associated Press) DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli forces shelled tent camps for displaced Palestinians north of Gaza’s southern city of Rafah on Friday, killing at least 25 people and wounding another 50, according to the territory’s Heath Ministry and emergency workers. It was the latest deadly attack in the tiny Palestinian enclave where hundreds of thousands have fled fighting between Israel and Hamas. Hamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada and the European Union. According to Ahmed Radwan, a spokesperson for the Civil Defense first responders in Rafah, witnesses told rescue workers about the shelling at two locations in a coastal area that has become filled with tents. The Health Ministry reported the number of people killed and wounded in the attacks. The locations of the attacks provided by Civil Defense were just outside an Israeli-designated safe zone. The Israeli military said the episode was under review but that “there is no indication that a strike was carried out by the IDF” in the area, using an acronym for the Israeli forces. It also did not offer details on any other strikes or what their intended targets might have been. Israel has previously bombed locations in the vicinity of the “humanitarian zone” in Muwasi, a rural area on the Mediterranean coast that has filled with sprawling tent camps in recent months. Witnesses whose relatives were killed in one of the bombardments near a Red Cross field hospital told The Associated Press that Israeli forces fired a second volley that killed people who had come out of their tents. The attack began with a munition that only made a loud bang and bright flash, said Mona Ashour, who lost her husband after he went to investigate what was happening. “We were in our tent, and they hit with a ‘sound bomb’ near the Red Cross tents, and then my husband came out at the first sound,” Ashour said, holding back tears while clutching a young girl outside Nasser Hospital in nearby Khan Younis. “And then they hit with the second one, which was a little closer to the entrance of the Red Cross,” she said. Hasan al-Najjar said his sons were killed helping people who panicked after the first strike. ”My two sons went after they heard the women and children screaming,” he said at the hospital. “They went to save the women, and they struck with the second projectile, and my sons were martyred. They struck the place twice.” The strikes came as Israel pushed ahead with its military operation in Rafah, where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge from fighting elsewhere in Gaza. Most have now fled Rafah, but the United Nations says no place in Gaza is safe and humanitarian conditions are dire as families shelter in tents and cramped apartments without adequate food, water, or medical supplies. Friday’s strikes took place less than a month after an Israeli bombing triggered a deadly fire that tore through a camp for displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza, drawing widespread international outrage — including from some of Israel’s closest allies — over the military’s expanding offensive into Rafah. Israel says it is targeting Hamas fighters and infrastructure and that it tries to minimize civilian deaths. It blames the large number of civilian casualties on combatants and says it’s because they operate among the population. With Israel’s war against Hamas now in its ninth month, international criticism is growing over Israel’s campaign of systematic destruction in Gaza, at a huge cost in civilian lives. The top United Nations court has concluded there is a “plausible risk of genocide” in Gaza — a charge Israel strongly denies. Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 37,100 people in Gaza, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Israel launched the war after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, in which fighters stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250.

                    "text": "By LINDSAY WHITEHURST (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Steve Bannon, a longtime ally of former President Donald Trump, asked the Supreme Court on Friday to delay his prison sentence while he fights his convictions for defying a subpoena from the House committee that investigated the attack on U.S. Capitol. The emergency application came after a federal appeals court panel rejected Bannon’s bid to avoid reporting to prison by July 1 to serve his four-month sentence. It was addressed to Chief Justice John Roberts, who oversees emergency appeals from courts in Washington, D.C. The high court asked the Justice Department to respond to the request by Wednesday, days before the court is set to begin its summer recess. The court denied a similar request from another Trump aide shortly after receiving a response in March. Bannon was convicted nearly two years ago of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Bannon has cast the case as politically motivated, and his attorney David Schoen has said the case raises “serious constitutional issues” that need to be examined by the Supreme Court. If Bannon goes to prison next month, he will likely have to serve his full sentence before the high court has the chance to review those questions, since the court is due to take its summer recess at the end of June, attorney Trent McCotter wrote in his emergency application. His lawyer says the former adviser didn’t ignore the subpoena but was still negotiating with the congressional committee when he was charged. His previous attorney told him that the subpoena was invalid because the Republican former president has asserted executive privilege and the committee would not allow a Trump lawyer in the room. In court papers, Bannon’s lawyers also previously argued that there is a “strong public interest” in allowing him to remain free in the run-up to the 2024 election because Bannon is a top adviser to Trump’s campaign. Bannon’s prison term has been delayed as he appealed. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols ordered him to turn himself in after an appeals court panel upheld his contempt of Congress convictions. A second Trump aide, trade adviser Peter Navarro, was also convicted of contempt of Congress. He reported to prison in March to serve his four-month sentence after the Supreme Court refused his bid to delay the sentence. Courts have rejected his executive-privilege argument, finding Navarro couldn’t prove Trump had actually invoked it. Bannon is also facing criminal charges in New York state court alleging he duped donors who gave money to build a wall along the U.S. southern border.

Bannon is scheduled to report to prison by July 1 for a four-month sentence after being found guilty of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the now-defunct House Jan. 6 Committee. His lawyers filed the application to the Supreme Court after a federal appellate court ruled 2-1 against an emergency appeal Thursday. “Mr. Bannon respectfully requests that his application be granted and that he remain on release pending the conclusion of his appeals, including a petition for a writ of certiorari, if timely sought,” the application filed Friday said. “If necessary, Mr. Bannon respectfully requests that the court issue an administrative stay of the July 1 surrender date to allow for sufficient time to consider this matter.” The Supreme Court has requested that the Department of Justice, which has opposed Bannon’s previous attempts to delay his prison sentence, file its response to Bannon’s latest application by 4 p.m. EDT Wednesday. Former Trump adviser Peter Navarro was also convicted of contempt of Congress charges after defying subpoenas from the Jan. 6 committee, but Navarro reported to prison for his four-month sentence in March.

                    "text": "Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon launched a last-minute bid Friday at the Supreme Court to stay out of prison as he appeals his convictions on two contempt of Congress charges. Bannon’s emergency application to the high court seeks to keep him from reporting to prison by July 1 on a 4-month prison sentence, and he filed it after two other courts denied his arguments to overturn his conviction. Last week, a divided panel of the U.S Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit panel found that Bannon’s arguments did not meet the extraordinary legal standard for him to remain free while fighting his conviction. However, Bannon’s emergency application argued that the justices will likely eventually overturn the rare contempt of Congress conviction, and he should remain free until he gets a chance to argue his case. Bannon’s application accused the government of “resurrecting” a law used against witnesses of the House Un-American Activities Committee in the 1950s, and argues the conviction also raises the possibility that one party that controls Congress and the White House could use contempt of Congress as a political tool. “In the future, when the House or Senate and the Executive Branch are controlled by the same party, there is every reason to fear that former Executive Branch officials will face prison after declining to provide privileged materials to a committee, even where the position taken was based upon the advice of counsel in good faith and requested further negotiations,” Bannon’s application said. Bannon last served in the White House in 2017, after serving as the CEO of Trump’s election campaign in 2016. Bannon was convicted of two counts of contempt of Congress in 2022 for defying subpoenas from the House select panel investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol seeking testimony and documents related to the attack. Since then, Bannon has argued that he was advised by his attorney that he did not have to cooperate with the investigation because the subpoena sought information subject to executive privilege. District Judge Carl Nichols of the District of Columbia and the D.C. Circuit have rejected those arguments. Late Thursday, a 2-1 panel of the appeals court said Bannon will have to serve out his prison term while he appeals. In the unsigned order, Judges Cornelia Pillard and Brad Garcia wrote that Bannon’s arguments had already been rejected by their court and the Supreme Court is unlikely to overturn the conviction. “If an assertion of good-faith reliance on advice of counsel excused a witness’s wholesale noncompliance, even as it is plainly unavailable to a more cooperative witness who appears but refuses to answer certain questions, Congress’s power of inquiry would be ‘nulli[fied],’” the order said. Judge Justin R. Walker dissented from the order, writing that the Supreme Court has a different set of precedents and could decide the case differently. Walker described the likely appeal a “close question” that the Supreme Court could decide the other way. “That close question may well have mattered at Bannon’s trial,” Walker wrote in a dissent. He later wrote that “Bannon should not go to prison before the Supreme Court considers his forthcoming petition for certiorari.” Nichols, the district judge in the case, had initially allowed Bannon to remain free while his D.C. Circuit appeal was pending. However, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit rejected Bannon’s initial appeal of the conviction, and Nichols ordered Bannon to report to prison by July 1. Bannon then launched his emergency appeal to the same three-judge panel that rejected his initial arguments. In the filing, Bannon said he may soon appeal his conviction to the Supreme Court and adopted some of the same “election interference” rhetoric used by former President Donald Trump on the campaign trail.",

                    "text": "Steve Bannon, a longtime ally of Donald Trump, asked the supreme court on Friday to delay his prison sentence while he fights his convictions for defying a subpoena from the House committee that investigated the attack on US Capitol. The emergency application came after a federal appeals court panel rejected Bannon’s bid to avoid reporting to prison by 1 July to serve his four-month sentence. It was addressed to Chief Justice John Roberts, who oversees emergency appeals from courts in Washington DC. The high court asked the justice department to respond to the request by Wednesday, days before the court is set to begin its summer recess. The court denied a similar request from another Trump aide shortly after receiving a response in March.Bannon was convicted nearly two years ago of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the January 6 House committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Bannon has cast the case as politically motivated, and his attorney David Schoen has said the case raises “serious constitutional issues” that need to be examined by the supreme court. Bannon is supposed to report to prison by 1 July to begin serving his four-month sentence for contempt of Congress. Carl Nichols, a US district judge who was nominated to the bench by Trump, earlier this month granted prosecutors’ request to send Bannon to prison after a three-judge panel of the US court of appeals for the DC circuit upheld his conviction. Bannon was convicted nearly two years ago of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the House January 6 committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in efforts by Trump, a Republican, to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to Joe Biden, a Democrat. Bannon’s lawyer at trial argued that the former Trump adviser didn’t ignore the subpoena but was still engaged in good-faith negotiations with the congressional committee when he was charged. The defense has said Bannon had been relying on the advice of his attorney, who believed that Bannon couldn’t testify or produce documents because Trump had invoked executive privilege. Lawyers for Bannon say the case raises serious legal questions that will likely need to be resolved by the supreme court, but he will have already finished his prison sentence by the time the case gets there. In court papers, Bannon’s lawyers also argued that there is a “strong public interest” in allowing him to remain free in the run-up to the 2024 election because Bannon is a top adviser to Trump’s campaign. Prosecutors said in court papers that Bannon’s “role in political discourse” is irrelevant. A second Trump aide, trade adviser Peter Navarro, is already serving his four-month prison sentence for contempt of Congress. The House January 6 committee’s final report asserted that Trump criminally engaged in a “multi-part conspiracy” to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 election and failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the US Capitol, concluding an extraordinary 18-month investigation into the former president and the violent insurrection.",

                    "text": "By MATTHEW PERRONE (AP Health Writer) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized the first menthol-flavored electronic cigarettes for adult smokers, acknowledging that vaping flavors can reduce the harms of traditional tobacco smoking. The FDA said it authorized four menthol e-cigarettes from Njoy, the vaping brand recently acquired by tobacco giant Altria, which also sells Marlboro cigarettes. The decision lends new credibility to vaping companies’ longstanding claim that their products can help blunt the toll of smoking, which is blamed for 480,000 U.S. deaths annually due to cancer, lung disease and heart disease. Parent groups and anti-tobacco advocates immediately criticized the decision, which comes after years of pushing regulators to keep menthol and other flavors that can appeal to teens off the market. “This decision could mean we’ll never be able to close the Pandora’s box of the youth vaping epidemic,” said Meredith Berkman, co-founder of Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes. “FDA has once again failed American families by allowing a predatory industry to source its next generation of lifetime customers — America’s children.” Youth vaping has declined from all-time highs in recent years, with about 10% of high schoolers reporting e-cigarette use last year. Of those who vaped, 90% used flavors, including menthol. All the e-cigarettes previously authorized by the FDA have been tobacco, which isn’t widely used by young people who vape. Njoy is one of only three companies that previously received FDA’s OK for vaping products. Like those products, the menthol varieties come as cartridges that plug into a reusable device that heats liquid nicotine, turning it into an inhalable aerosol. Njoy’s products accounted for less than 3% of U.S. e-cigarette sales in the past year, according to retail data from Nielsen. Vuse, owned by Reynolds American, and Juul control about 60% of the market, while hundreds of disposable brands account for the rest. Most teens who vape use disposable e-cigarettes, including brands like Elf Bar, which come in flavors such as watermelon and blueberry ice. Altria’s data showed Njoy e-cigarettes helped smokers reduce their exposure to the harmful chemicals in traditional cigarettes, the FDA said. The agency stressed the products are neither safe nor “FDA approved,” and that people who don’t smoke shouldn’t use them. Friday’s action is part of a sweeping FDA review intended to bring scientific scrutiny to the multibillion-dollar vaping market after years of regulatory delays. Currently the U.S. market includes thousands of fruit- and candy-flavored vapes that are technically illegal but are widely available in convenience stores, gas stations and vape shops. The FDA faced a self-imposed court deadline at the end of this month to wrap up its yearslong review of major vaping brands, including Juul and Vuse. Those brands have been sold in the U.S. for years, awaiting FDA action on their scientific applications. To stay on the market, companies must show that their e-cigarettes provide an overall health benefit for smokers, without significantly appealing to kids. “Based upon our rigorous scientific review, in this instance, the strength of evidence of benefits to adult smokers from completely switching to a less harmful product was sufficient to outweigh the risks to youth,” said Matthew Farrelly of FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

All the e-cigarettes previously authorized by the FDA have been tobacco flavored, which isn't widely used by young people who vape. Altria's data showed NJOY e-cigarettes helped smokers reduce their exposure to the harmful chemicals in traditional cigarettes, the FDA said. The agency stressed the products are neither safe nor “FDA approved,” and that people who don’t smoke shouldn’t use them. Friday’s action is part of a sweeping FDA review intended to bring scientific scrutiny to the multibillion-dollar vaping market after years of regulatory delays. Currently the U.S. market includes thousands of fruit and candy flavored vapes that are technically illegal but have gone unregulated. The FDA faces a court deadline at the end of this month to wrap up its yearslong review of major vaping brands, including rivals like Juul and Vuse. All of those brands have been sold in the U.S. for years, awaiting FDA action on their scientific applications. To stay on the market, companies must show that their products provide an overall health benefit for smokers, without significantly appealing to kids. “Based upon our rigorous scientific review, in this instance, the strength of evidence of benefits to adult smokers from completely switching to a less harmful product was sufficient to outweigh the risks to youth,” said Matthew Farrelly of FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products.",

                    "text": "The Food and Drug Administration approved the first menthol-flavored electronic cigarettes in the United States on Friday. The FDA said it had authorized four e-cigarette products made by the vaping company Njoy. Two of the products are pre-filled pods used with an e-cigarette device, while the other two are disposable e-cigarettes. The FDA’s decision to authorize the products was based on evidence showing that the products could provide some benefit to adult smokers. “Based upon our rigorous scientific review, in this instance, the strength of evidence of benefits to adult smokers from completely switching to a less harmful product was sufficient to outweigh the risks to youth,” Matthew Farrelly, director of the Office of Science in the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products, said in a statement. In addition to the four menthol-flavored e-cigarette products approved Friday, the FDA has authorized 23 tobacco-flavored products and devices. Its decision was met with criticism from anti-tobacco groups, who warn that the flavor of menthol is especially appealing to young people. “The FDA’s decision … is deeply troubling given the extensive scientific evidence that menthol is a flavor that appeals to kids and the FDA’s repeated conclusions that flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol-flavored products, have driven youth e-cigarette use,” Yolanda Richardson, president and CEO of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a statement. Richardson cited data from the 2023 National Youth Tobacco Survey, which found that nearly a quarter of high school e-cigarette users nationwide use menthol-flavored e-cigarettes. The decision comes two months after the Biden administration delayed its plan to ban menthol cigarettes. The FDA said it “remains concerned about the risk of youth use of all e-cigarettes.” It added that each application is reviewed on a case-by-case basis and that the authorizations of the four Njoy products do not apply to any other menthol-flavored e-cigarette products.",

                    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized the first menthol-flavored electronic cigarettes for adult smokers, acknowledging that vaping flavors can reduce the harms of traditional tobacco smoking. The FDA said it authorized four menthol e-cigarettes from Njoy, the vaping brand recently acquired by tobacco giant Altria, which also sells Marlboro cigarettes. The decision lends new credibility to vaping companies’ longstanding claim that their products can help blunt the toll of smoking, which is blamed for 480,000 U.S. deaths annually due to cancer, lung disease and heart disease. E-cigarettes have been sold in the U.S. since 2007 but in recent years their potential benefits for smokers have been overshadowed by their use by adolescents and teens. Parents and anti-tobacco groups immediately criticized the decision, which follows years of advocacy efforts to keep menthol and other flavors that can appeal to teens off the market. “This decision could mean we’ll never be able to close the Pandora’s box of the youth vaping epidemic,” said Meredith Berkman, co-founder of Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes. “FDA has once again failed American families by allowing a predatory industry to source its next generation of lifetime customers — America’s children.” Youth vaping has declined from all-time highs in recent years, with about 10% of high schoolers reporting e-cigarette use last year. Of those who vaped, 90% used flavors, including menthol. All the e-cigarettes previously authorized by the FDA have been tobacco, which isn’t widely used by young people who vape. Njoy is one of only three companies that previously received FDA’s OK for vaping products. Like those products, two of the Njoy menthol varieties come as cartridges that plug into a reusable device that heats liquid nicotine, turning it into an inhalable aerosol. The other two Njoy menthol products are disposable e-cigarettes. Njoy’s products accounted for less than 3% of U.S. e-cigarette sales in the past year, according to retail data from Nielsen. Vuse, owned by Reynolds American, and Juul control about 60% of the market, while hundreds of disposable brands account for the rest. Most teens who vape use disposable e-cigarettes, including brands like Elf Bar, which come in flavors such as watermelon and blueberry ice. Altria’s data showed Njoy e-cigarettes helped smokers reduce their exposure to the harmful chemicals in traditional cigarettes, the FDA said. The agency stressed the products are neither safe nor “FDA approved,” and that people who don’t smoke shouldn’t use them. Friday’s action is part of a sweeping FDA review intended to bring scientific scrutiny to the multibillion-dollar vaping market after years of regulatory delays. Currently the U.S. market includes thousands of fruit- and candy-flavored vapes that are technically illegal but are widely available in convenience stores, gas stations and vape shops. The FDA faced a self-imposed court deadline at the end of this month to wrap up its yearslong review of major vaping brands, including Juul and Vuse. Those brands have been sold in the U.S. for years, awaiting FDA action on their scientific applications. To stay on the market, companies must show that their e-cigarettes provide an overall health benefit for smokers, without significantly appealing to kids. “Based upon our rigorous scientific review, in this instance, the strength of evidence of benefits to adult smokers from completely switching to a less harmful product was sufficient to outweigh the risks to youth,” said Matthew Farrelly of FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products. Richmond-based Altria previously took a $13 billion stake in Juul in 2018, when the brand controlled most of the U.S. vaping market. But Juul’s value plummeted after it was hit with lawsuits and investigations over its role in sparking a national spike in underage vaping. ___ This story has been updated to correct that two of the four menthol e-cigarettes from Njoy are disposable products. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

If the flag at the beach is red, do not go in the water. 2. Watch the water before jumping in, even on green flag days. 3. Don't enter the water where waves aren't breaking. 4. Always watch the water as rip currents shift. 5. If you get caught in a rip current, do not panic and try to fight it. Float, wave for help and/or swim parallel to the shore. \"These signs are posted at every single beach guarded and unguarded. Please, if you’re visiting go to guarded beach first. Read these signs.

Earlier in the day on Thursday, Martin County Fire Rescue posted on Facebook that red flags were flying at Jensen Beach, Stuart Beach and the Hobe Sound. A rough surf and rip current warning was also posted. “Happy Thursday! The surf is 4-6 ft and there is a light drift heading north, so be aware if you chose(sic) to go in the ocean,” the post read. “The water temp is 77 degrees and there’s a(sic) ESE wind blowing about 15-20 mph. We suggest strong swimmers only because rip currents are expected. If you plan on heading to the beach, please visit one of our guarded beaches.” The post was made at 11:31 a.m. and a 911 call reporting missing swimmers came in at around 1:30 p.m., according to the fire service.

The couple, identified as Brian Warter, 51, and Erica Wishard, 48, was swimming near Stuart Beach on Hutchinson Island when they were swept out to sea by a rip current, according to the Martin County Sheriff’s Office. Two of the couple’s teenage children were also swimming and got swept out by the current, but were able to break it. The children attempted to help their parents, but were forced to swim ashore after it became too dangerous, according to MCSO. Warter and Wishard were located more than 100 yards offshore by Martin County Ocean Rescue, which performed CPR on both victims on shore. They were transported via ambulance to Cleveland Clinic Martin North Hospital in Stuart, Florida, where they were pronounced deceased. The couple’s children, who are mostly teenaged, were assisted by an MCSO Crisis Intervention Team Deputy while awaiting the arrival of other family members in Florida, authorities said. “Multiple witnesses told our investigators that both the male and female, who are now deceased, got into the ocean right into a rip current and immediately were pulled from the shore,” said MCSO Chief Deputy John Budensiek. “One of the children of the deceased was trying to yell to them instructions of how to swim parallel to the shore, don’t fight, but they were in panic mode and unfortunately went under.” About 100 people drown in rip current every year in the U.S., according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In order to escape a rip current, NOAA recommends “wave, yell and stay parallel,” meaning swimmers should stay calm, stay afloat and yell to lifeguards for help. It is also advised that swimmers do not swim against the current toward shore, but rather swim parallel to the shore to allow to escape the current or to allow more time for you to be rescued.",

Brian Warter, 51, and Erica Wishard, 48, were swimming with their children off the coast of Hutchinson Island on Thursday, June 20, when the strong tide swept the couple away from the shore, according to a post from the Martin County Sheriff’s Office on Facebook. Warter and Wishard’s two teenagers also were swept out by the current, but they were able to swim out of it and attempted to help their parents — until “it became too dangerous and they were forced to swim ashore,” the sheriff’s office said. Lifeguards with Martin County Ocean Rescue located the adults and began CPR. The couple was then transported to Cleveland Clinic Martin North Hospital in Stuart where they were pronounced dead, per the sheriff’s office. A Martin County Sheriff’s crisis intervention team deputy assisted the couple’s children throughout the day and evening as they awaited the arrival of other family members traveling to Florida in the wake of the tragedy. According to The Philadelphia Inquirer, the family is from Chester County, Penn.

                    "text": "HUTCHINSON ISLAND, Fla. (AP) — A Pennsylvania couple vacationing in Florida with their six children drowned after they were caught in a rip current while swimming, authorities said. Brian Warter, 51, and 48-year-old Erica Wishard, and two of their mostly teenage children were caught in the current on Hutchinson Island, along Florida’s southeast coast, the Martin County Sheriff’s Office said in a Facebook post. “The kids were able to break the current and attempted to help their parents, but it became too dangerous and they were forced to swim ashore,” investigators said. Martin County Ocean Rescue attempted life-saving measures and took the couple to a local hospital where they were pronounced dead, according to the sheriff’s office. A crisis intervention deputy is assisting the children while other family members travel to meet them in Florida. The sheriff’s office did not say where in Pennsylvania the family was from. A rip current is a fast-moving column of water that flows away from the shore toward open water. Officials say swimmers caught in one should remain calm and then swim parallel to the shore to escape the current. Fire Rescue officials said there were red flags at the beach Thursday, indicating the possibility of hazardous surf conditions. “A lot of people are locals, they understand rip tides. They know what to do, what not to do,” Martin County Chief Deputy John Budensiek told WPTV. “They know where to get in the ocean and where not to. We get these vacationers that come in and, unfortunately, this ends poorly for them. There’s no way to get the message out to all of them.” Hutchinson Island is about 55 miles (88 kilometers) north of West Palm Beach. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Brian Warter, 51, and Erica Wishard, 48, were in the water when they and two of their teenage children got caught in the current. The two children escaped from the current and tried to help their parents, but were ultimately forced to swim back, the Martin County Sheriff’s Office said in a Facebook post. The incident occurred at around 1:30 p.m., Martin County Fire Rescue said on Facebook. Lifeguards retrieved the unconscious Mr. Warter and Ms. Wishard from the water and began CPR. Rip currents are columns of water that push away from shorelines and toward open bodies of water. Swimming parallel to the shore can help those stuck in such dangerous currents. “One of the children of the deceased was trying to yell them instructions of how to swim parallel to the shore. Don’t fight. But they were in panic mode and, unfortunately, went under,” Deputy Chief John Budensiek told WPTV-TV. None of Mr. Warter and Ms. Wishard’s children were named by authorities. After performing CPR, responders continued to attempt to save their lives in an ambulance and then at a hospital, where both were pronounced dead.",

                    "text": "By MEG KINNARD (Associated Press) CHAPIN, S.C. (AP) — The president of the Teamsters Union is set to speak at next month’s Republican National Convention, as Donald Trump angles to chip away at President Joe Biden’s support among the blue-collar workers who are expected to play a major role in the general election, particularly in crucial Midwestern swing states like Wisconsin and Michigan. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said that O’Brien had “accepted my invitation to speak at the RNC Convention in Milwaukee.” Teamsters spokesperson Kara Deniz said Friday that O’Brien had requested a speaking slot at both major party conventions and accepted Trump’s invitation for the RNC, marking the first time a Teamsters president would speak at the GOP event. DNC officials did not immediately respond to whether O’Brien would speak at their event. Trump has been trying to make inroads among Biden’s support among organized labor heading into the general election, as he works to win over the blue-collar workers who helped fuel his 2016 victory. Union members tend to vote Democratic, with 56% of members and households backing Biden in 2020, according to AP VoteCast. In September, while his GOP rivals met for a debate, Trump traveled to Michigan and tried to win over autoworkers by lambasting Biden’s electric vehicles push in the midst of a strike. During his speech, Trump urged the United Auto Workers to endorse him, directly appealing to union president Shawn Fain — though he spoke from the floor of a nonunionized auto-parts plant. Fain instead called Trump a “scab,” a derogatory term for workers who cross union picket lines and work during a strike, as he endorsed Biden. In January, Trump called on UAW members to oust Fain after the group endorsed Biden. O’Brien meanwhile has met privately with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club, where the two discussed issues including right-to-work laws that allow those in unionized workplaces to opt out of paying dues and fees. After a roundtable with Teamster leaders in January, Trump called the event “a very productive meeting,” acknowledging that the union typically backs Democrats, but, referencing the possibility of an endorsement, “Stranger things have happened.” O’Brien later described the roundtable conversation with Trump as “pleasant” and “direct” but said the union was a long way from making a decision. After meeting with Biden in March, O’Brien said the president has been “great” for workers but stressed that “there’s still a lot of work to be done” to bolster unions. Biden — who has long billed himself as the most labor-friendly president in history, going so far as to turn up on a picket line in the Detroit area during the autoworkers strike last fall — has already received significant organized labor backing with early endorsements from the AFL-CIO and others. But Trump is hoping to cut into that support as he casts himself as pro-worker and tries to exacerbate divisions between union leaders and some rank-and-file members. The Teamsters union represents 1.3 million workers, including UPS drivers, film and television workers, freight operators, members of law enforcement and other government workers. It backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020, although O’Brien has stressed that the union is keeping an open mind on endorsements this cycle. The group generally waits until after both parties’ summer nominating conventions to make a formal endorsement, and it will “most likely” do so again this year, once it polls its members, solicits rank-and-file input and reconvenes its leadership team, O’Brien has said. ___ Associated Press writer Linley Sanders in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP",

                    "text": "By MEG KINNARD (Associated Press) CHAPIN, S.C. (AP) — The president of the Teamsters Union is set to speak at next month’s Republican National Convention, as Donald Trump angles to chip away at President Joe Biden’s support among the blue-collar workers who are expected to play a major role in the general election, particularly in crucial Midwestern swing states like Wisconsin and Michigan. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said that O’Brien had “accepted my invitation to speak at the RNC Convention in Milwaukee.” Teamsters spokesperson Kara Deniz said Friday that O’Brien had requested a speaking slot at both major party conventions and accepted Trump’s invitation for the RNC, marking the first time a Teamsters president would speak at the GOP event. DNC officials did not immediately respond to whether O’Brien would speak at their event. Trump has been trying to make inroads among Biden’s support among organized labor heading into the general election, as he works to win over the blue-collar workers who helped fuel his 2016 victory. Union members tend to vote Democratic, with 56% of members and households backing Biden in 2020, according to AP VoteCast. In September, while his GOP rivals met for a debate, Trump traveled to Michigan and tried to win over autoworkers by lambasting Biden’s electric vehicles push in the midst of a strike. During his speech, Trump urged the United Auto Workers to endorse him, directly appealing to union president Shawn Fain — though he spoke from the floor of a nonunionized auto-parts plant. Fain instead called Trump a “scab,” a derogatory term for workers who cross union picket lines and work during a strike, as he endorsed Biden. In January, Trump called on UAW members to oust Fain after the group endorsed Biden. O’Brien meanwhile has met privately with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club, where the two discussed issues including right-to-work laws that allow those in unionized workplaces to opt out of paying dues and fees. After a roundtable with Teamster leaders in January, Trump called the event “a very productive meeting,” acknowledging that the union typically backs Democrats, but, referencing the possibility of an endorsement, “Stranger things have happened.” O’Brien later described the roundtable conversation with Trump as “pleasant” and “direct” but said the union was a long way from making a decision. After meeting with Biden in March, O’Brien said the president has been “great” for workers but stressed that “there’s still a lot of work to be done” to bolster unions. Biden — who has long billed himself as the most labor-friendly president in history, going so far as to turn up on a picket line in the Detroit area during the autoworkers strike last fall — has already received significant organized labor backing with early endorsements from the AFL-CIO and others. But Trump is hoping to cut into that support as he casts himself as pro-worker and tries to exacerbate divisions between union leaders and some rank-and-file members. The Teamsters union represents 1.3 million workers, including UPS drivers, film and television workers, freight operators, members of law enforcement and other government workers.

Dump trucks unloaded big chunks of mangled fake concrete onto Superior Avenue. Lots of crumpled cars arrived on a flatbed. A fictitious Jitters Coffee has taken over Rising Star Coffee’s storefront at the Arcade. The Leader Building now has a snazzy Daily Planet sphere over an entrance as the newspaper where Clark Kent, Lois Lane and others work. No cameras were spotted on Day 1, however. That’s expected to change in the coming days as street closures remain in effect today and Saturday, and again next Tuesday. We’ll be there every day. We’re also on the lookout for actors such as David Corenswet (Kent/Superman) and Rachel Brosnahan (Lane). The movie is expected in theaters next summer. When you watch it and try to identify all the Cleveland landmarks, you can thank the Greater Cleveland Film Commission and an $11 million tax credit for luring the moviemakers to our city. — Kristen Davis Overnight Scores and Weather Guardians vs. Seattle Mariners: Guardians’ three-run fifth inning just enough to win season series from Mariners, 6-3 Northeast Ohio weather forecast: Heat continues through weekend Top stories Cleveland transforms: Downtown Cleveland is ready for its closeup. On Thursday, a film crew for DC’s upcoming “Superman” movie started making Superior Avenue over for what it appears to be an explosive action scene. Joey Morona reports that means there will be some street closings. FirstEnergy: A FirstEnergy executive indicted on bribery-related charges indicated he intends to call Gov. Mike DeWine and Lt. Gov. Jon Husted as defense witnesses, reports Jake Zuckerman. Mike Dowling, a senior vice president of FirstEnergy who was accused alongside the company CEO of paying a $4.3 million bribe to a top DeWine appointee, included Ohio’s two top executive officials in a witness list filed late Tuesday afternoon. Ransomware attack: Cleveland officials can’t yet say whether the recent ransomware attack allowed hackers to steal sensitive personal information from city employees and members of the public, reports Courtney Astolfi. A spokeswoman for Mayor Justin Bibb on Thursday didn’t definitively rule out the possibility that Cleveland could eventually pay a ransom to regain access to information that was potentially stolen, but said City Hall is not “actively negotiating” with the hackers and officials “have no intent of paying the ransom at this time.” Today in Ohio: The U.S. Department of Justice intervened this week in a lawsuit over a state election law that says only a postal worker or a close relative can handle a voter’s mail-in ballot. We’re talking about whether that law disenfranchises people with disabilities on Today in Ohio, cleveland.com’s daily half-hour news podcast. Statehouse and Politics Reinstated license: The Ohio Supreme Court has reinstated the law license of a Noble County defense attorney who threw a Pringles potato chip can filled with his own feces into the parking lot of a crime-victim advocacy center, reports Jeremy Pelzer. Minimum wage: U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders wants to raise the national minimum wage to $17 an hour, reports Andrew Tobias. But, he said a proposed Ohio ballot measure that would raise the minimum wage to $15 by 2026 for nontipped workers and for all workers by 2029 is a step in the right direction. Cleveland RNC: “Horrible” or not, Donald Trump now appears to be set to stay in Milwaukee for next month’s Republican National Convention after media reports in Chicago from earlier this week initially linked his overnight plans to the former president’s property in the Windy City. But Trump showed no public signs of foot-dragging when it came to the last big GOP convention, held in Cleveland in 2016, Andrew Tobias reports. Space weapons: House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Mike Turner, a Dayton Republican, on Thursday compared the threat of Russian nuclear anti-satellite weapons to the Cuban Missile Crisis and accused President Joe Biden’s administration of failing to address it, reports Sabrina Eaton. Tire retreading: Two congressional Democrats from Northeast Ohio want to incentivize consumers to purchase retreads as a way to encourage buying American-made tires and promote jobs at retreading facilities, reports Sabrina Eaton. Recreational marijuana: State employees aged 21 and older can use recreational marijuana while they’re off duty, but only if they work in positions not subject to random drug testing, reports Laura Hancock. The policy was updated in December after voters approved the initiated statute that allows adults aged 21 and older to use marijuana. Northeast Ohio News Record heat: Cleveland tied its record high temperature on the Juneteenth holiday amid a heat wave enveloping the region, reports Adam Ferrise. Cleveland broke the all-time temperature record on Monday and flirted with the record Tuesday. Wednesday marked the third consecutive day topping 90 degrees, making it the first June heat wave in Cleveland since 2017. Surface temperatures: As the heatwave continues, Zachary Smith and Sean McDonnell went around Cleveland and its suburbs to measure the surface temperatures of different items people have to interact with everyday. Be careful this wee ... a plastic slide was measured at 152 degrees. Kindland: On June 6, Kindland’s parent organization, Values in Action, celebrated its 30th anniversary with a “Values Matter” dinner-mixer and awards event, reports Peter Chakerian. Advance Ohio, which operates cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer, was recognized for its ongoing Kindland series, which continues to bring readers face-to-face with stories of positivity, courage and kindness from all corners of Northeast Ohio. Rocky River dinosaurs: If you’re out in any of Rocky River’s 10 city parks starting Sunday through July 14, you might spot a dinosaur, reports Cory Shaffer. Miniature figurines are hidden by Rocky River Parks and Recreation Foundation as part of the organization’s 2024 scavenger hunt. Healthcare and Business UH layoffs: University Hospitals will eliminate more than 300 leadership positions as the health system continues taking steps to fix two years of budget shortfalls and cope with rising costs, reports Julie Washington. The cuts represent more than 10% of UH’s leadership. Medina toxins: While toxic chemical releases have decreased throughout Northeast Ohio overall, Medina County saw an increase from 2021 to 2022, reports Zachary Smith. More than 218,000 pounds of toxic chemicals were released in 2022 than the year before. Chemotherapy research: Cleveland Clinic researchers believe they may have discovered one of the ways that ovarian cancer cells resist chemotherapy, reports Gretchen Cuda Kroen. The results may help them identify patients unlikely to benefit from the treatment, the researchers say. College Now: College Now has named Warrensville Heights native Michele Scott Taylor as its new CEO, reports Megan Sims. The organization helps Northeast Ohioans pursue postsecondary education. She will take on the role at the start of 2025. Ben Venue Laboratories: A pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Bedford that was once home to Ben Venue Laboratories has changed hands again, which will lead to more than 200 workers losing their jobs amid the transition, reports Sean McDonnell. COVID cases: The number of new COVID-19 cases in Ohio climbed for the third straight week, going from 1,370 last week to 1,489 this week, reports Julie Washington. Crime and Courts Browns car crash: Lonnie Phelps, a defensive end for the Browns, was arrested Wednesday night and accused of crashing his SUV into a Florida restaurant and then refusing to cooperate with officers, according to a police report. Phelps was charged with drunken driving and damaging property after the accident at the Red Shoe Island Bistro, a high-end restaurant in Key West. The Browns have waived Phelps. Child pornography: FBI agents found thousands of images of child pornography on the laptop of a former star of the reality TV show “90-day Fiancé,” reports Adam Ferrise. Michael J. Eloshway, 42, had 7,182 videos or images of child sexual assault on his computer seized from his home during a May 2023 raid, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer King wrote in court records.

Theft scheme: Yue Cao, 34, an employee at an Ohio bank, pilfered some $2.1 million from elderly customers’ accounts by stealing information he had access to and opening online accounts that he controlled, reports Adam Ferrise. Firefighters honored: The Cleveland Division of Fire on Thursday honored the 50th anniversary of two firefighters who died in the line of duty, reports Olivia Mitchell. Indictment: A Cuyahoga County grand jury handed up an indictment Thursday that accuses three men of killing a woman in front of her two children, reports Olivia Mitchell. The grand jury charged Jamar Skanes, 49, of Garfield Heights, Alontez Beasley, 34, of Cleveland, and Clarence Bennett, 43, of Cleveland, with aggravated murder, conspiracy to commit murder, murder and felonious assault. Arts and Entertainment Summer days: It’s the first official weekend of summer and there’s plenty to do across The Land, reports Joey Morona. The next few days are packed with festivals, concerts, theater performances and more. But which ones are worth your time? Paddlefest postponed: In an unfortunate bit of irony, the Blazing Paddles Paddlefest planned for Saturday on the Cuyahoga River in downtown Cleveland has been postponed because of the blazing weather, Cliff Pinckard reports. Great Council State Park: Susan Glaser reports on Ohio’s newest park, on land where the Shawnee people once gathered. The centerpiece of the park is a 12,000-square-foot interpretive center modeled after a historic Shawnee longhouse.

                    "text": "The average interest rate for a standard 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.92% today, a decrease of -0.08% from seven days ago. The average rate for a 15-year fixed mortgage is 6.35%, which is a decrease of -0.08% compared to a week ago. For a look at mortgage rate movement, see the chart below. The Federal Reserve has been pushing off interest rate cuts because inflation has been slow to improve. While experts still expect mortgage rates to gradually move lower in the coming months, housing market predictions can always change in response to economic data, geopolitical events and more. Lower mortgage rates make buying a home more affordable. Experts recommend shopping around with different mortgage lenders to find the best deal.

This tool features partner rates from lenders that you can use when comparing multiple mortgage rates. What is a good mortgage type and term? Each mortgage has a loan term, or payment schedule. The most common mortgage terms are 15 and 30 years, although 10-, 20- and 40-year mortgages also exist. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate is set for the duration of the loan, offering stability. With an adjustable-rate mortgage, the interest rate is only fixed for a certain amount of time (commonly five, seven or 10 years), after which the rate adjusts annually based on the market. Fixed-rate mortgages are a better option if you plan to live in a home in the long term, but adjustable-rate mortgages may offer lower interest rates upfront. 30-year fixed-rate mortgages The 30-year fixed-mortgage rate average is 6.92% today. A 30-year fixed mortgage is the most common loan term. It will often have a higher interest rate than a 15-year mortgage, but you’ll have a lower monthly payment. 15-year fixed-rate mortgages Today, the average rate for a 15-year, fixed mortgage is 6.35%. Though you’ll have a bigger monthly payment than a 30-year fixed mortgage, a 15-year loan usually comes with a lower interest rate, allowing you to pay less interest in the long run and pay off your mortgage sooner. 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgages A 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage has an average rate of 6.59% today. You’ll typically get a lower introductory interest rate with a 5/1 ARM in the first five years of the mortgage. But you could pay more after that period, depending on how the rate adjusts annually. If you plan to sell or refinance your house within five years, an ARM could be a good option. Current mortgage rate trends At the start of the pandemic, mortgage rates were near record lows, around 3%. That all changed as inflation began to surge and the Federal Reserve kicked off a series of aggressive interest rate hikes starting in March 2022 to slow the economy, which indirectly drove up mortgage rates. Now, more than two years later, mortgage rates are still around 7%. Over the last several months, mortgage rates have fluctuated in response to economic data and investors’ expectations as to when the Fed will start to lower rates. Today’s homebuyers have less room in their budget to afford the cost of a home due to elevated mortgage rates and steep home prices. Limited housing inventory and low wage growth are also contributing to the affordability crisis and keeping mortgage demand down. Mortgage predictions for 2024 Most experts predict mortgage rates will fall below 7% in the coming months. However, a sustained downward trend will depend on several factors, including upcoming inflation and labor data. The Fed hasn’t hiked interest rates in almost a year, but an actual rate cut doesn’t appear imminent. Some experts say the first cut could come as early as July, though it’s more likely we see the Fed lower rates in September or November. “If the Fed makes any moves later this year, the signal would be sufficient for the mortgage market, and mortgage rates would start falling,” said Selma Hepp, chief economist at CoreLogic. “In that case, we could see the mortgage rates around 6.5% at the year-end.” One thing is for sure: Homebuyers won’t see lower mortgage overnight, and a return to the 2-3% mortgage rates from just a few years ago is unlikely. Here’s a look at where some major housing authorities expect average mortgage rates to land. Calculate your monthly mortgage payment Getting a mortgage should always depend on your financial situation and long-term goals. The most important thing is to make a budget and try to stay within your means. CNET’s mortgage calculator below can help homebuyers prepare for monthly mortgage payments. How can I get the lowest mortgage rates? Though mortgage rates and home prices are high, the housing market won’t be unaffordable forever. It’s always a good time to save for a down payment and improve your credit score to help you secure a competitive mortgage rate when the time is right. Save for a bigger down payment: Though a 20% down payment isn’t required, a larger upfront payment means taking out a smaller mortgage, which will help you save in interest. Boost your credit score: You can qualify for a conventional mortgage with a 620 credit score, but a higher score of at least 740 will get you better rates. Pay off debt: Experts recommend a debt-to-income ratio of 36% or less to help you qualify for the best rates. Not carrying other debt will put you in a better position to handle your monthly payments. Research loans and assistance: Government-sponsored loans have more flexible borrowing requirements than conventional loans. Some government-sponsored or private programs can also help with your down payment and closing costs. Shop around for lenders: Researching and comparing multiple loan offers from different lenders can help you secure the lowest mortgage rate for your situation.",

Enter your information below to get a custom quote from one of CNET’s partner lenders. About these rates: Like CNET, Bankrate is owned by Red Ventures. This tool features partner rates from lenders that you can use when comparing multiple mortgage rates. Refinance rate news When mortgage rates hit historic lows during the pandemic, there was a refinancing boom, as homeowners were able to nab lower interest rates. But with current average mortgage rates around 7%, getting a new home loan isn’t as financially viable. Early in the year, hopes were high for a summer rate cut from the Fed. But over the past few months, inflation has remained high and the labor market strong, making it clear to investors that the Fed will take longer than expected to lower rates. Higher mortgage rates make refinancing less attractive to homeowners, making them more likely to hold onto their existing mortgages. Where refinance rates are headed in 2024 “The odds are good that rates will end 2024 lower than they are now,” said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of mortgage site, HSH.com. But predicting exactly where mortgage rates will end up is difficult because it hinges on economic data we don’t yet have. If inflation continues to improve and the Fed is able to cut rates, mortgage refinance rates could end the year between 6% and 6.5%. But data showing higher inflation could cause investors to reconsider the likelihood of Fed rate cuts and send mortgage rates higher, according to Orphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow Home Loans. If you’re considering a refinance, remember that you can’t time the economy: Interest rates fluctuate on an hourly, daily and weekly basis, and are influenced by an array of factors. Your best move is to keep an eye on day-to-day rate changes and have a game plan on how to capitalize on a big enough percentage drop, said Matt Graham of Mortgage News Daily. Refinancing 101 When you refinance your mortgage, you take out another home loan that pays off your initial mortgage. With a traditional refinance, your new home loan will have a different term and/or interest rate. With a cash-out refinance, you’ll tap into your equity with a new loan that’s bigger than your existing mortgage balance, allowing you to pocket the difference in cash. Refinancing can be a great financial move if you score a low rate or can pay off your home loan in less time, but consider whether it’s the right choice for you. Reducing your interest rate by 1% or more is an incentive to refinance, allowing you to cut your monthly payment significantly. How to choose the right refinance type and term The rates advertised online often require specific conditions for eligibility. Your personal interest rate will be influenced by market conditions as well as your specific credit history, financial profile and application. Having a high credit score, a low credit utilization ratio and a history of consistent and on-time payments will generally help you get the best interest rates. 30-year fixed-rate refinance The current average interest rate for a 30-year refinance is 6.93%, a decrease of 6 basis points compared to one week ago. (A basis point is equivalent to 0.01%.) A 30-year fixed refinance will typically have lower monthly payments than a 15-year or 10-year refinance, but it will take you longer to pay off and typically cost you more in interest over the long term. 15-year fixed-rate refinance The average rate for a 15-year fixed refinance loan is currently 6.42%, a decrease of 6 basis points compared to one week ago. Though a 15-year fixed refinance will most likely raise your monthly payment compared to a 30-year loan, you’ll save more money over time because you’re paying off your loan quicker. Also, 15-year refinance rates are typically lower than 30-year refinance rates, which will help you save more in the long run. 10-year fixed-rate refinance The average 10-year fixed refinance rate right now is 6.24%, a decrease of 11 basis points from what we saw the previous week. A 10-year refinance typically has the lowest interest rate but the highest monthly payment of all refinance terms. A 10-year refinance can help you pay off your house much quicker and save on interest, but make sure you can afford the steeper monthly payment. To get the best refinance rates, make your application as strong as possible by getting your finances in order, using credit responsibly and monitoring your credit regularly. And don’t forget to speak with multiple lenders and shop around. Does refinancing make sense? Homeowners usually refinance to save money, but there are other reasons to do so. Here are the most common reasons homeowners refinance: To get a lower interest rate: If you can secure a rate that’s at least 1% lower than the one on your current mortgage, it could make sense to refinance. To switch the type of mortgage: If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage and want greater security, you could refinance to a fixed-rate mortgage. To eliminate mortgage insurance: If you have an FHA loan that requires mortgage insurance, you can refinance to a conventional loan once you have 20% equity. To change the length of a loan term: Refinancing to a longer loan term could lower your monthly payment. Refinancing to a shorter term will save you interest in the long run. To tap into your equity through a cash-out refinance: If you replace your mortgage with a larger loan, you can receive the difference in cash to cover a large expense. To take someone off the mortgage: In case of divorce, you can apply for a new home loan in just your name and use the funds to pay off your existing mortgage.",

                    "title": "Best CD Rates Today: Boost Your Returns With These Top CDs, June 21, 2024",
                    "text": "Certificate of deposit rates remain high following the Federal Reserve’s latest rate pause last week. But with the possibility of rate cuts later this year, now’s the time to secure a great rate and protect your earnings. Today’s top CDs have annual percentage yields, or APYs, up 5.35%. But experts anticipate the Fed will start lowering rates in the second half of 2024, so the sooner you lock in one of these APYs, the greater your earning potential could be. Your rate is locked in when you open a CD, so your returns will be guaranteed regardless of what the Fed decides next. Experts recommend comparing rates before opening a CD account to get the best APY possible. Enter your information below to get CNET’s partners’ best rate for your area. Today’s best CD rates Here are some of the top CD rates available right now and how much you could earn by depositing $5,000 right now: How long will CD rates stay high? The Fed doesn’t directly set CD interest rates, but its decisions have ripple effects. The federal funds rate determines how much it costs banks to borrow and lend money to each other. So, when the Fed raises this rate, banks tend to raise APYs on consumer products like savings accounts and CDs to boost their cash reserves and stay competitive. When the Fed cuts this rate, APYs on these products drop, too. Starting in March 2022, the Fed raised the federal funds rate 11 times to combat record-high inflation, and CD rates skyrocketed, with some accounts offering APYs over 5.5% heading into fall 2023. But as inflation began to show signs of cooling, the Fed paused rates at its September 2023 meeting -- and every meeting since then. As a result, CD rates plateaued and then began dropping as experts predicted rate cuts in the second half of 2024. Over the last week, rates remained relatively steady as banks awaited the Fed’s June decision. Here’s where CD rates are now compared to last week: Experts anticipate at least one rate cut later this year, which means CD rates are likely to begin falling again. “Since the outlook for rates to come back down from now toward the end of 2024 is still expected, I anticipate that CD rates will likely trend lower in anticipation of the Fed’s eventual rate cut, with longer-term CDs affected more than shorter-term CDs,” said Dana Menard, CFP, founder and lead financial planner at Twin Cities Wealth Strategies. Locking in today’s high APYs will protect your earnings from rate cuts when they do happen. How you’ll benefit from opening a CD today With rates still attractive, now’s the time to open a CD and lock in a high APY. But a fixed rate isn’t the only perk you’ll enjoy by opening a CD today. CDs are insured up to $250,000 per person, per bank, as long as the bank is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Credit unions offer the same protection through the National Credit Union Administration. That means your money is safe up to the deposit limits if the bank fails. Plus, unlike investments such as stocks, CDs are low-risk. You won’t lose your principal deposit or the interest you’ve earned unless you run into early withdrawal penalties -- which you can easily avoid by choosing the right term for your needs. Factors to consider when choosing a CD A competitive APY is important, but there are other things you should consider when comparing CD accounts: When you’ll need your money: Early withdrawal penalties can reduce your interest earnings. So, be sure to choose a term that fits your savings timeline. “Different CDs have different maturity dates, so you’ll want to make sure the CD matures before you’ll need the money,” said Keith Spencer, CFP, founder and financial planner at Spencer Financial Planning, LLC. “For example, if you’re planning on purchasing a car a year from now and would like to put the money in a CD in the meantime, you’ll want to choose a CD with a maturity date of one year or less.” Alternatively, you can select a no-penalty CD, although the APY may not be as high as you’d get with a traditional CD of the same term. Minimum deposit requirement: Some CDs require a minimum amount to open an account -- typically, $500 to $1,000. Others do not. How much money you have to set aside can help you narrow down your options. Fees: Maintenance and other fees can eat into your earnings. Many online banks don’t charge fees because they have lower overhead costs than banks with physical branches. Still, read the fine print for any account you’re evaluating. Federal deposit insurance: Make sure any institution you’re considering is an FDIC or NCUA member so your money is protected if the bank fails. Customer ratings and reviews: Visit sites like Trustpilot to see what customers are saying about any bank you’re considering. You want a bank that’s responsive, professional and easy to work with.

                    "title": "Judge dismisses charges in Nevada fake electors case over venue question, attorney general to appeal",
                    "text": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — A Nevada state court judge dismissed a criminal indictment Friday against six Republicans accused of submitting certificates to Congress falsely declaring Donald Trump the winner of the state’s 2020 presidential election, potentially killing the case with a ruling that state prosecutors chose the wrong venue to file the case. Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford stood in a Las Vegas courtroom a moment after Clark County District Court Judge Mary Kay Holthus delivered her ruling, declaring that he would take the case directly to the state Supreme Court. “The judge got it wrong and we’ll be appealing immediately,” Ford told reporters afterward. He declined any additional comment. Defense attorneys bluntly declared the case dead, saying that to bring the case now to another grand jury in another venue such as Nevada’s capital city of Carson City would violate a three-year statute of limitations on filing charges that expired in December. “They’re done,” said Margaret McLetchie, attorney for Clark County Republican party chairman Jesse Law, one of the defendants in the case. The judge called off trial, which had been scheduled for next January, for defendants that included state GOP chairman Michael McDonald; national party committee member Jim DeGraffenreid; national and Douglas County committee member Shawn Meehan; and Eileen Rice, a party member from the Lake Tahoe area. Each was charged with offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument, felonies that carry penalties of up to four or five years in prison. Defense attorneys contended that Ford improperly brought the case in Las Vegas instead of Carson City or Reno, northern Nevada cities closer to where the alleged crime occurred. They also accused prosecutors of failing to present to the grand jury evidence that would have exonerated their clients, and said their clients had no intent to commit a crime. All but Meehan have been named by the state party as Nevada delegates to the 2024 Republican National Convention next month in Milwaukee. Meehan’s defense attorney, Sigal Chattah, said her client “chose not to” seek the position. Chattah ran as a Republican in 2022 for state attorney general and lost to Ford, a Democrat, by just under 8% of the vote. After the court hearing, Hindle’s attorney, Brian Hardy, declined to comment on calls that his client has faced from advocacy groups that say he should resign from his elected position as overseer of elections in northern Nevada’s Story County, a jurisdiction with a few more than 4,100 residents. Those calls included ones at a news conference Friday outside the courthouse by leaders of three organizations. Nevada is one of seven presidential battleground states where slates of fake electors falsely certified that Trump had won in 2020, not Democrat Joe Biden. Others are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Criminal charges have been brought in Michigan, Georgia and Arizona. Trump lost Nevada in 2020 by more than 30,000 votes to Biden and the state’s Democratic electors certified the results in the presence of Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican. Her defense of the results as reliable and accurate led the state GOP to censure her, but Cegavske later conducted an investigation that found no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud in the state.",

                    "title": "Judge Dismisses Nevada Alternate Electors Case Due to Jurisdiction Concerns",
                    "text": "A Nevada judge on Friday dismissed the alternate electors’ case against six Republicans who were alleged to have submitted fraudulent certificates to Congress in the aftermath of the 2020 election. Clark County Judge Mary Kay Holthus issued a bench ruling on Friday during a hearing at the Clark County District Court that dismissed the case, according to courtroom reporters. The judge said she was not convinced by state prosecutors’ arguments that Clark County was the proper venue to hear the case, appearing to side with defense attorneys who said the signing of the certificates occurred in Douglas County. “You have literally, in my opinion, a crime that has occurred in another jurisdiction,” Judge Holthus said at the hearing. “It’s so appropriately up north and so appropriately not here.” In dismissing the case, the judge called off the trial, which had been scheduled for next January. The defendants included state GOP chairman Michael McDonald; national party committee member Jim DeGraffenreid; national and Douglas County committee member Shawn Meehan; and Eileen Rice, a party member from the Lake Tahoe area. Each was charged with offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument, felonies that carry penalties of up to five years in prison. Defense attorneys contended that Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford improperly brought the case in Las Vegas instead of Carson City or Reno, which are cities located near where the alleged crime took place. After the hearing, Mr. Ford told reporters at the court that “the judge got it wrong and we’ll be appealing immediately.” He did not provide any more details. Margaret McLetchie, an attorney for one of the defendants, told news outlets that it’s unlikely the case will proceed. “They’re done,” she said. She said that the attorney general would have to now bring the case to another grand jury in another venue such as Nevada’s capital city of Carson City, which would violate a three-year statute of limitations on filing charges that expired in December 2023. Earlier this year, attorney Richard Wright, who was representing the defendants, argued that prosecutors made a “politically expedient” move by bringing the case in Clark County. Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, votes more in favor of Democrats in national elections, suggesting that the jury pool may have had a more unfavorable view of the Republicans who were accused of a crime. In late 2023, Mr. Ford, a Democrat, brought his case against the six Republicans, accusing them of “efforts to undermine faith in our democracy ... after the 2020 election.” At the time, a grand jury returned an indictment of the six for allegedly portraying themselves as Nevada’s presidential electors after the 2020 election’s conclusion. After they were indicted, a number of media outlets described the Republicans as “fake electors” or “false electors.” Nevada is one of seven presidential battleground states where slates of alternate electors certified that incumbent President Donald Trump had won the general election in 2020, not Democrat challenger Joe Biden. The Silver State is again forecast to be a swing state for the 2024 presidential contest. Others are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Criminal charges have been brought in Michigan, Georgia, and Arizona. In Arizona, a handful of Trump-affiliated officials and individuals were indicted, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, lawyer Jenna Ellis, former Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn, former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, former U.S. Senate candidate James Lamon, and more. In 2020, election data showed that former President Trump was behind then-candidate Biden by about 30,000 votes in Nevada. The state’s Democrat Party electors then certified those results at a ceremony alongside Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican. The Epoch Times has contacted Mr. Ford’s office for comment.",

                    "text": "A judge in Nevada dismissed a case Friday involving six defendants who faced charges of illegally claiming they were the state’s electors in the wake of former President Donald Trump‘s defeat in the 2020 presidential election. Judge Mary Kay Holthus of Clark County said at a hearing that the Nevada attorney general, a Democrat, filed the charges in a county that lacked jurisdiction over the case, according to the website the Nevada Independent. “You have literally, in my opinion, a crime that has occurred in another jurisdiction,” Holthus said. “It’s so appropriately up north and so appropriately not here.” The defendants’ attorneys argued the charges should be dropped, claiming that other venues, such as Carson City or Douglas County, were more appropriate because activities cited in the indictment had taken place in those locations. While statutes of limitations prevent the state from being able to bring charges again in a different jurisdiction, a spokesman for Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford said in a statement to the Washington Examiner that his office will challenge Holthus’s ruling. “We disagree with the judge’s decision and will be appealing immediately,” the spokesman said. The six defendants charged included Michael McDonald, Nevada GOP chairman and a loyal supporter of Trump since 2015. The other five defendants were Jesse Law, Jim DeGraffenreid, Durward James Hindle III, Shawn Meehan, and Eileen Rice. Ford opted to bring the charges last December in one of the bluest counties in the state, which could have led to the court selecting jurors from a pool containing more Democrats. “When the efforts to undermine faith in our democracy began after the 2020 election, I made it clear that I would do everything in my power to defend the institutions of our nation and our state,” Ford said in a statement at the time. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Nevada is the first battleground state to dismiss a case related to alternate electors. Similar cases are playing out in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis wrapped Trump into the election-related charges against 19 defendants in Georgia, but the case is stalled indefinitely while an appellate court reviews Trump’s argument that Willis should be disqualified over a conflict of interest.",

                    "text": "LAS VEGAS — A Nevada state court judge dismissed a criminal indictment Friday against six Republicans accused of submitting certificates to Congress falsely declaring Donald Trump the winner of the state’s 2020 presidential election, potentially killing the case with a ruling that state prosecutors chose the wrong venue to file the case. Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford stood in a Las Vegas courtroom a moment after Clark County District Court Judge Mary Kay Holthus delivered her ruling, declaring that he would take the case directly to the state Supreme Court. “The judge got it wrong and we’ll be appealing immediately,” Ford told reporters afterward. He declined any additional comment. Defense attorneys bluntly declared the case dead, saying that to bring the case now to another grand jury in another venue such as Nevada’s capital city of Carson City would violate a three-year statute of limitations on filing charges that expired in December. “They’re done,” said Margaret McLetchie, attorney for Clark County Republican party chairman Jesse Law, one of the defendants in the case. The judge called off trial, which had been scheduled for next January, for defendants that included state GOP chairman Michael McDonald; national party committee member Jim DeGraffenreid; national and Douglas County committee member Shawn Meehan; and Eileen Rice, a party member from the Lake Tahoe area. Each was charged with offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument, felonies that carry penalties of up to four or five years in prison. Defense attorneys contended that Ford improperly brought the case in Las Vegas instead of Carson City or Reno, northern Nevada cities closer to where the alleged crime occurred. They also accused prosecutors of failing to present to the grand jury evidence that would have exonerated their clients, and said their clients had no intent to commit a crime. All but Meehan have been named by the state party as Nevada delegates to the 2024 Republican National Convention next month in Milwaukee. Meehan’s defense attorney, Sigal Chattah, said her client “chose not to” seek the position. Chattah ran as a Republican in 2022 for state attorney general and lost to Ford, a Democrat, by just under 8% of the vote. After the court hearing, Hindle’s attorney, Brian Hardy, declined to comment on calls that his client has faced from advocacy groups that say he should resign from his elected position as overseer of elections in northern Nevada’s Story County, a jurisdiction with a few more than 4,100 residents. Those calls included ones at a news conference Friday outside the courthouse by leaders of three organizations. Nevada is one of seven presidential battleground states where slates of fake electors falsely certified that Trump had won in 2020, not Democrat Joe Biden. Others are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Criminal charges have been brought in Michigan, Georgia and Arizona. Trump lost Nevada in 2020 by more than 30,000 votes to Biden and the state’s Democratic electors certified the results in the presence of Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican. Her defense of the results as reliable and accurate led the state GOP to censure her, but Cegavske later conducted an investigation that found no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud in the state.",

                    "text": "Seoul, South Korea — South Korea summoned the Russian ambassador to protest Moscow's new defense pact with North Korea on Friday as tensions at the Koreas' heavily fortified border continued to rise with vague threats from Pyongyang and brief, seemingly accidental incursions by North Korean troops.Earlier Friday, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued a vague threat of retaliation after South Korean activists flew balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets across the border, and South Korea's military said it had fired warning shots the previous day to repel North Korean soldiers who briefly crossed the rivals' land border for the third time this month. That came two days after Moscow and Pyongyang reached a pact vowing mutual defense assistance if either is attacked, and a day after Seoul responded by saying it would consider providing arms to Ukraine to fight Russia's invasion.South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Hong Kyun summoned Russian Ambassador Georgy Zinoviev to protest the deal between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un and called for Moscow to immediately halt its alleged military cooperation with Pyongyang. Kim, the South Korean diplomat, stressed that any cooperation that directly or indirectly helps the North build up its military capabilities would violate U.N. Security Council resolutions and pose a threat to the South's security and warned of consequences for Seoul's relations with Moscow. Zinoviev replied that he would convey Seoul's concerns to his superiors in Moscow, the ministry said. Reuters reports that Zinoviev said he told Kim threats and blackmail against Moscow over its growing ties to Pyongyang are unacceptable. Leafletting campaigns by South Korean civilian activists in recent weeks have prompted a resumption of Cold War-style psychological warfare along the inter-Korean border.The South Korean civilian activists, led by North Korean defector Park Sang-hak, said it sent 20 balloons carrying 300,000 propaganda leaflets, 5,000 USB sticks with South Korean pop songs and TV dramas and 3,000 U.S. dollar bills from the South Korean border town of Paju on Thursday night. Pyongyang resents such material and fears it could demoralize front-line troops and residents and eventually weaken Kim Jong Un's grip on power, analysts say. In a statement carried by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency, Kim Yo Jong, one of her brother's top foreign policy officials, called the activists \"defector scum\" and issued what appeared to be a threat of retaliation. \"When you do something you were clearly warned not to do, it's only natural that you will find yourself dealing with something you didn't have to,\" she said, without specifying what the North would do. After previous leafletting by South Korean activists, North Korea launched more than 1,000 balloons that dropped tons of trash in South Korea, smashing roof tiles and windows and causing other property damage. Kim Yo Jong previously hinted that balloons could become the North's standard response to leafletting, saying that the North would respond by \"scattering dozens of times more rubbish than is being scattered on us.\" In response, South Korea resumed anti-North Korea propaganda broadcasts with military loudspeakers installed at the border for the first time in years, to which Kim Yo Jong, in another state media statement, warned that Seoul was \"creating a prelude to a very dangerous situation.\" Tensions between the Koreas are at their highest in years as Kim Jong Un accelerates his nuclear weapons and missile development and attempts to strengthen his regional footing by aligning with Putin in a standoff against the U.S.-led West. South Korea, a growing arms exporter with a well-equipped military backed by the United States, says it's considering upping support for Ukraine in response. Seoul has already provided humanitarian aid and other support while joining U.S.-led economic sanctions against Moscow. But it hasn't directly provided munitions, citing a long-standing policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflict. Putin told reporters in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Thursday that supplying weapons to Ukraine would be \"a very big mistake\" and said South Korea \"shouldn't worry\" about the new agreement with North Korea if the South isn't planning aggression against Pyongyang. South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul on Friday held separate phone calls with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa to discuss the new pact. The diplomats agreed that the agreement poses a serious threat to peace and stability in the region and vowed to strengthen trilateral coordination to deal with the challenges posed by the alignment between Moscow and Pyongyang, Cho's ministry said in a statement. North Korea is extremely sensitive to criticism of Kim's authoritarian rule and efforts to reach its people with foreign news and other media. In 2015, when South Korea restarted loudspeaker broadcasts for the first time in 11 years, North Korea fired artillery rounds across the border, prompting South Korea to return fire, according to South Korean officials. No casualties were reported. South Korea's military said there are signs that North Korea was installing its own speakers at the border, although they weren't working yet. In the latest border incident, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said several North Korean soldiers engaged in unspecified construction work briefly crossed the military demarcation line that divides the two countries at around 11 a.m. Thursday. The South Korean military broadcast a warning and fired warning shots, after which the North Korean soldiers retreated. The joint chiefs didn't immediately release more details, including why it was releasing the information a day late. South Korea's military says believes recent border intrusions weren't intentional, since the North Korean soldiers haven't returned fire and retreated after the warning shots. The South's military has observed the North deploying large numbers of soldiers in frontline areas to build suspected anti-tank barriers, reinforce roads and plant mines in an apparent attempt to fortify their side of the border. Seoul believes the efforts are likely aimed at preventing North Korean civilians and soldiers from escaping to the South.",

                    "text": "A push for Germany to consider the viability of using third countries to deport Afghan and Syrian refugees and process asylum seekers is meeting stiff resistance from rights groups and advocates. The issue was a major topic of discussion in talks between Chancellor Olaf Scholz and the leaders of Germany's 16 states in Berlin on June 20. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said during a meeting of regional interior ministers the same day that \"concrete negotiations\" are under way and that she was \"confident\" a way would be found to deport Afghan or Syrian immigrants convicted of serious crimes. Faeser said the measures would only affect a small number of people, and that in the case of Afghan nationals deportations could be conducted via third countries such as Uzbekistan. Ahead of the meetings, which came on World Refugee Day, more than 300 organizations issued an open letter to Scholz in which they sharply criticized the initiative. \"Please issue a clear rejection of plans to outsource asylum procedures,\" said the letter, whose signatories included Amnesty International Germany, Doctors Without Borders, and the German migrant advocacy group Pro Asyl. \"Plans to deport refugees to non-European third countries or to carry out asylum procedures outside the EU...do not work in practice, are extremely expensive, and pose a threat to the rule of law.\" The signatories argued such measures would result in serious human rights abuses and integrating asylum seekers into society can succeed with greater cooperation. The backlash against refugees has risen among conservative and hard-right politicians after a 25-year-old Afghan was accused of stabbing a German police officer to death late last month. Germany halted deportations to Afghanistan after the Taliban seized power in Kabul in August 2021, and Berlin has no diplomatic ties with the de-facto government formed by the hard-line Islamist leaders. Germany is also a major destination for Syrians seeking to escape that country's civil war and rule under leader Bashar al-Assad. Syrians are the largest refugee group in Germany, with hundreds of thousands allowed into the country since 2015. The security and human rights situations in both Afghanistan and Syria are considered dire by watchdogs. Scholz has previously backed dropping Germany's ban on deportations, however. On June 19 his vice chancellor, Robert Habeck, voiced his support for deportations at least in situations where individuals were suspected of terrorism or convicted of serious crimes like murder. Proponents of the idea are reportedly considering whether it might be possible to conduct such deportations through third countries such as Uzbekistan while still staying in compliance with international law. Faeser told the Neue Osnabrucker newspaper that negotiations have taken place with \"various countries\" and \"we want to consistently expel and deport Islamist threats.\" The Interior Ministry is also reportedly seeking ways of conducting asylum proceedings in third countries outside the European Union, similar to plans by Italy with Albania. The United Kingdom's deal to send asylum seekers to Rwanda has also been cited by advocates as an example. Michael Stuebgen, the interior minister of the eastern state of Brandenburg, has argued Germany could engage in talks with the Taliban and that parts of Syria are secure enough to allow the returns of refugees. Opponents have argued that deportations of Afghans and Syrian refugees would go against the German constitution and commitments under international law and that the outsourcing of asylum procedures would violate asylum-seekers' human rights. During their three days of talks that end on June 21, the state interior ministers are also reportedly considering cutting welfare benefits paid to Ukrainian refugees. With reporting by dpa and AP",

PHOTOS: South Korea summons Russian ambassador as tensions rise with North Korea Leafletting campaigns by South Korean civilian activists in recent weeks have prompted a resumption of Cold War-style psychological warfare along the inter-Korean border. The South Korean civilian activists, led by North Korean defector Park Sang-hak, said it sent 20 balloons carrying 300,000 propaganda leaflets, 5,000 USB sticks with South Korean pop songs and TV dramas, and 3,000 U.S. dollar bills from the South Korean border town of Paju on Thursday night. Pyongyang resents such material and fears it could demoralize front-line troops and residents and eventually weaken Kim Jong Un’s grip on power, analysts say. In a statement carried by North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency, Kim Yo Jong, one of her brother’s top foreign policy officials, called the activists “defector scum” and issued what appeared to be a threat of retaliation. “When you do something you were clearly warned not to do, it’s only natural that you will find yourself dealing with something you didn’t have to,” she said, without specifying what the North would do. After previous leafletting by South Korean activists, North Korea launched more than 1,000 balloons that dropped tons of trash in South Korea, smashing roof tiles and windows and causing other property damage. Kim Yo Jong previously hinted that balloons could become the North’s standard response to leafletting, saying that the North would respond by “scattering dozens of times more rubbish than is being scattered on us.” In response, South Korea resumed anti-North Korea propaganda broadcasts with military loudspeakers installed at the border for the first time in years, to which Kim Yo Jong, in another state media statement, warned that Seoul was “creating a prelude to a very dangerous situation.” Tensions between the Koreas are at their highest in years as Kim Jong Un accelerates his nuclear weapons and missile development and attempts to strengthen his regional footing by aligning with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a standoff against the U.S.-led West. South Korea, a growing arms exporter with a well-equipped military backed by the United States, says it is considering upping support for Ukraine in response. Seoul has already provided humanitarian aid and other support while joining U.S.-led economic sanctions against Moscow. But it has not directly provided arms, citing a long-standing policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflict. Putin told reporters in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Thursday that supplying weapons to Ukraine would be “a very big mistake,” and said South Korea “shouldn’t worry” about the agreement if it isn’t planning aggression against Pyongyang. South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said Minister Cho Tae-yul on Friday held separate phone calls with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa to discuss the new pact. The diplomats agreed that the agreement poses a serious threat to peace and stability in the region and vowed to strengthen trilateral coordination to deal with the challenges posed by the alignment between Moscow and Pyongyang, Cho’s ministry said in a statement. North Korea is extremely sensitive to criticism of Kim’s authoritarian rule and efforts to reach its people with foreign news and other media. In 2015, when South Korea restarted loudspeaker broadcasts for the first time in 11 years, North Korea fired artillery rounds across the border, prompting South Korea to return fire, according to South Korean officials. No casualties were reported. South Korea’s military said there are signs that North Korea was installing its own speakers at the border, although they weren’t yet working. In the latest border incident, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said several North Korean soldiers engaged in unspecified construction work briefly crossed the military demarcation line that divides the two countries at around 11 a.m. Thursday. The South Korean military broadcast a warning and fired warning shots, after which the North Korean soldiers retreated. The joint chiefs didn’t immediately release more details, including why it was releasing the information a day late. South Korea’s military says believes recent border intrusions were not intentional, as the North Korean soldiers have not returned fire and retreated after the warning shots. The South’s military has observed the North deploying large numbers of soldiers in frontline areas to build suspected anti-tank barriers, reinforce roads and plant mines in an apparent attempt to fortify their side of the border. Seoul believes the efforts are likely aimed at preventing North Korean civilians and soldiers from escaping to the South.",

                    "text": "FORT PIERCE — When U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon convenes court in the U.S. government’s classified documents case against former President Donald Trump on Friday, the proceedings may sound more like a law school colloquium than a defense-prosecution hearing on a motion to dismiss. Besides prosecutors working for the government and attorneys arguing for Trump and co-defendants Waltine Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, a lineup of third-party lawyers will appear in a federal courtroom in Fort Pierce to discuss the constitutionality of Special Counsel Jack Smith’s appointment to take the former president to court over his alleged mishandling of classified documents and efforts to block the government from retrieving them. It’s a question that many critics believe should have been disposed of quickly months ago by the judge, who was reportedly asked by two other Southern District of Florida judges to step aside from the case in favor of a more experienced jurist. Cannon was said to have rejected the suggestions, according to anonymous attorneys quoted by The New York Times. The daylong hearing on Friday at the Alto Lee Adams, Sr. United States Courthouse will focus on arguments similar to those rejected by other judges in challenges to special counsels Robert Mueller, who investigated Trump’s relationship with Russia, and David Weiss, who has been prosecuting President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, on gun and tax charges. On Monday, Cannon is scheduled to hear a related defense challenge of Smith with the focus on the funding of his office. That question, too, has failed to gain traction with other judges. On Tuesday, Cannon is scheduled to hear arguments on whether a federal judge in Washington, D.C. improperly allowed testimony from onetime Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran, under a crime-fraud exception to attorney-client privilege. Smith has alleged Trump misled the lawyer during his bid to obstruct the government’s investigation. Trump has pleaded not guilty first to a 37-count indictment handed up last June and again to additional charges in a superseding indictment returned later. His codefendants, Nauta, a personal valet, and De Oliveira, a Mar-a-Lago property manager, also have pleaded not guilty. Critics of the judge assert that Cannon has effectively bought into a defense strategy of delaying a trial until after the November presidential election. She has conducted lengthy hearings on issues, they say, that most other judges would have quickly ruled upon after reviewing written motions filed with the court. Instead, Cannon cancelled a May 20 start date for a trial, declaring there is a myriad of pretrial issues to decide including more than a half dozen motions to dismiss, as well as a variety of disputes between Trump’s lawyers and the prosecutors over the handling of classified documents at trial. Recently, the judge has rejected some dismissal motions, saying it is too early in the proceedings to consider them, or more appropriately presented as jury instructions. The defense had challenged counts related to obstruction and false statements that they said were duplicative and prejudicial. But Cannon said in an order that “the identified deficiencies, even if generating some arguable confusion, are either permitted by law, raise evidentiary challenges not appropriate for disposition at this juncture, and/or do not require dismissal even if technically deficient, so long as the jury is instructed appropriately and presented with adequate verdict forms as to each Defendants’ alleged conduct.” Previously the judge rejected other motions to dismiss, including one that suggested that Trump was authorized under the Presidential Records Act to keep the documents with him after he left the White House in 2021 and to designate them as his own. More critics of U.S. gag order bid Still, there are more third parties headed for Fort Pierce to opine on other issues, the latest being the government’s motion to impose a gag order against Trump from denouncing FBI agents in public over their search for documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach. Late Thursday, Cannon green-lighted a filing backing Trump by America First Legal, a Washington-based nonprofit foundation headed by former West Wing senior adviser Stephen Miller. The foundation said in a filing with the court that it “has a special interest in protecting First Amendment liberties like those at issue in this case.” “Most importantly,” the foundation added, the foundation “writes to protect the freedom of a major party presidential candidate in the upcoming election to speak freely on matters affecting politics and government—core areas of First Amendment expression.” This is a developing story, so check back for updates.

                    "text": "FORT PIERCE — Proceedings before U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon in the U.S. government’s classified documents case against former President Donald Trump Friday morning sounded more like a law school colloquium than a defense-prosecution hearing on a motion to dismiss. Emil Bove, a former prosecutor in the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, carried the arguments for the defense, emphasizing that there is no statue that allowed Special Counsel Jack Smith to be appointed to investigate the reports from the National Archives that Trump had potentially classified papers at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach. The discussion on Friday veered from the question of who acts as Smith’s boss to decades-old precedents involving previous special prosecutors. At one point, Bove claimed that the Justice Department could in essence create a “shadow government” through appointment of special counsels. Smith’s team has maintained that Attorney General Merrick Garland, as head of the U.S. Justice Department, was empowered to appoint Smith and to delegate prosecutorial decisions to him. Besides prosecutors working for the government and attorneys arguing for Trump and co-defendants Waltine Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, a lineup of third-party lawyers will appear in a federal courtroom in Fort Pierce to discuss the constitutionality of Smith’s appointment to take the former president to court over his alleged mishandling of classified documents and efforts to block the government from retrieving them. It’s a question that many critics believe should have been disposed of quickly months ago by the judge, who was reportedly asked by two other Southern District of Florida judges to step aside from the case in favor of a more experienced jurist. Cannon was said to have rejected the suggestions, according to anonymous attorneys quoted by The New York Times. The daylong hearing on Friday at the Alto Lee Adams, Sr. United States Courthouse focuses on arguments similar to those rejected by other judges in challenges to special counsels Mueller, who investigated Trump’s relationship with Russia, and David Weiss, who has been prosecuting President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, on gun and tax charges. On Monday, Cannon is scheduled to hear a related defense challenge of Smith with the focus on the funding of his office. That question, too, has failed to gain traction with other judges. On Tuesday, Cannon is scheduled to hear arguments on whether a federal judge in Washington, D.C. improperly allowed testimony from onetime Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran, under a crime-fraud exception to attorney-client privilege. Smith has alleged Trump misled the lawyer during his bid to obstruct the government’s investigation. Trump has pleaded not guilty first to a 37-count indictment handed up last June and again to additional charges in a superseding indictment returned later. His codefendants, Nauta, a personal valet, and De Oliveira, a Mar-a-Lago property manager, also have pleaded not guilty. Critics of the judge assert that Cannon has effectively bought into a defense strategy of delaying a trial until after the November presidential election. She has conducted lengthy hearings on issues, they say, that most other judges would have quickly ruled upon after reviewing written motions filed with the court. Instead, Cannon cancelled a May 20 start date for a trial, declaring there is a myriad of pretrial issues to decide including more than a half dozen motions to dismiss, as well as a variety of disputes between Trump’s lawyers and the prosecutors over the handling of classified documents at trial. Recently, the judge has rejected some dismissal motions, saying it is too early in the proceedings to consider them, or more appropriately presented as jury instructions.

The foundation said in a filing with the court that it “has a special interest in protecting First Amendment liberties like those at issue in this case.” “Most importantly,” the foundation added, the foundation “writes to protect the freedom of a major party presidential candidate in the upcoming election to speak freely on matters affecting politics and government—core areas of First Amendment expression.” This is a developing story, so check back for updates.

                    "text": "The judge presiding over former President Trump's classified records case is holding a hearing Friday to consider whether the appointment of U.S. Special Counsel Jack Smith and the funding of his investigations is \"unlawful.\" Judge Aileen Cannon of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida had postponed the trial stemming from Smith’s investigation into Trump’s alleged improper retention of classified records indefinitely. Upon postponing the trial, Cannon scheduled deadlines for reports on June 10 and 17 and a nonevidentiary hearing on a motion to dismiss on Friday, \"based on unlawful appointment and funding of special counsel.\" Cannon expanded Friday's hearing to allow amici to argue before the court, as well as Trump defense attorneys and federal prosecutors. TRUMP CLASSIFIED DOCS JUDGE EXPANDS HEARING TO CONSIDER 'UNLAWFUL' APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH Former Attorney General Ed Meese, who served under former President Reagan, filed an amicus brief in the case, in which he argues that Attorney General Merrick Garland’s appointment of Smith as special counsel – a private citizen at the time – is in violation of the appointments clause of the Constitution. Garland appointed Smith as special counsel on Nov. 18, 2022 – just days after Trump announced he would run for president in 2024. \"Not clothed in the authority of the federal government, Smith is a modern example of the naked emperor,\" the brief states. \"Improperly appointed, he has no more authority to represent the United States in this Court than Bryce Harper, Taylor Swift, or Jeff Bezos,\" they argued. FEDERAL JUDGE POSTPONES TRUMP'S CLASSIFIED RECORDS TRIAL WITH NO NEW DATE Meese argues that the \"illegality\" of Smith’s appointment is \"sufficient to sink Smith’s petition, and the Court should deny review.\" Meese and company noted in the brief that Smith was appointed \"to conduct the ongoing investigation into whether any person or entity [including former President Trump] violated the law in connection with efforts to interfere with the lawful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election or the certification of the Electoral College vote held on or about January 6, 2021.\" Garland defended his move earlier this month during a hearing on Capitol Hill, arguing that \"there are regulations under which the attorney general appoint special counsel. They have been in effect for 30 years, maybe longer, under both parties.\" \"The matter that you're talking about, about whether somebody can have an employee of the Justice Department serve as special counsel has been adjudicated,\" Garland argued, adding that other special counsel appointments he and other attorneys general have made cite a regulation that points to a statute. REP. MASSIE PRESSES GARLAND ON CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH’S APPOINTMENT Meese, however, in his briefs filed in several points in the Trump cases, argued that \"none of those statutes, nor any other statutory or constitutional provisions, remotely authorized the appointment by the Attorney General of a private citizen to receive extraordinary criminal law enforcement power under the title of Special Counsel.\" Meese’s brief was even mentioned in a question by Justice Clarence Thomas in the Supreme Court oral arguments over Trump's presidential immunity in Smith’s other case regarding 2020 election interference, which the high court is expected to decide this month. Presenting arguments on June 21 in Florida on behalf of Meese will be Gene Schaerr; Josh Blackman on behalf of Professor Seth Barrett Tillman; and Matthew Seligman on behalf of constitutional lawyers, former government officials, and \"State Democracy Defenders Action.\" Meanwhile, Cannon scheduled an additional hearing from June 24 to 26 and set deadlines for disclosures from the special counsel for early July and the defendants’ speedy trial report for July 19 – the final day of the Republican National Convention. Trump is set to be sentenced in Manhattan after being found guilty on all counts in New York v. Trump, stemming from District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation on July 11. Cannon scheduled a status conference for July 22 and another hearing for later that day. Cannon did not schedule a new trial date. Trump faced charges stemming from Smith's investigation into his possession of classified materials. He pleaded not guilty to all 37 felony counts from Smith’s probe, including willful retention of national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice and false statements. Trump was also charged with an additional three counts as part of a superseding indictment from the investigation – an additional count of willful retention of national defense information and two additional obstruction counts. Trump pleaded not guilty. Cannon's move last month to indefinitely postpone the trial comes after the judge unsealed a slew of documents related to the FBI’s investigation into the former president and the FBI’s raid on his Mar-a-Lago, Florida, estate in 2022. The documents provided a detailed look into the personnel involved in the raid on Mar-a-Lago and a play-by-play timeline of it. One of the documents is an FBI file that suggests the agency's investigation into Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified documents was dubbed \"Plasmic Echo.\" HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE INVESTIGATES 'MANIPULATED' EVIDENCE SEIZED BY FBI IN TRUMP CLASSIFIED RECORDS PROBE Another unsealed FBI memo memorialized the role of Garland in the investigation. In a document dated March 30, 2022, Garland provided his approval to allow the investigation into Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified documents to upgrade to a \"full investigation.\" \"This email conveys Department of Justice (DOJ) Attorney General (AG) [Merrick Garland] approval for conversion to a full investigation,\" a synopsis of the restricted document reads. Also, last month, Smith and federal prosecutors admitted in a court filing that documents seized during the raid on Mar-a-Lago are no longer in their original order and sequence. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"There are some boxes where the order of items within that box is not the same as in the associated scans,\" Smith's filing states. The prosecutors had previously told the court that the documents were \"in their original, intact form as seized.\" House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, is investigating whether that evidence was \"altered or manipulated.\" Smith also charged Trump in a separate jurisdiction, in Washington, D.C., out of his investigation into election interference and Jan. 6. Trump pleaded not guilty to those charges, as well. That trial was postponed indefinitely. The Supreme Court is considering arguments on presidential immunity and whether Trump is immune from prosecution in Smith's case. The high court is expected to rule on the matter by the end of the term next week.",

                    "text": "Washington — Special counsel Jack Smith and attorneys for former President Donald Trump will be back in a Florida federal courtroom Friday to kick off three days of hearings to grapple with, among other issues, whether Smith should even be allowed to prosecute Trump. The former president challenged the appointment and funding of the special counsel and argued in filings in February that Smith \"lacks the authority to prosecute this action.\" Trump's legal team employed a legal theory that has been rejected by courts in attempts to oppose other independent Justice Department probes. Trump's attorneys say Attorney General Merrick Garland lacked the constitutional authority to appoint Smith, arguing that a special counsel must be appointed by the president and approved by the Senate. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon has taken the unusual step of inviting outside groups to argue each side of the issue before the court. Former federal prosecutors and elected officials filed a brief in support of Smith's appointment and urged her to rule swiftly against Trump to avoid what they said would be unnecessary hearings on the matter. The group includes former Justice Department officials who served under Republican presidential administrations and a former Republican member of Congress.On the other side, former U.S. Attorneys General Edwin Meese and Michael Mukasey, who each served as attorney general in Republican administrations, wrote to bolster Trump's challenge. They said that \"nearly all\" special prosecutors in recent history were previously appointed by the sitting president and approved by the Senate as U.S. attorneys. Smith was \"neither,\" they wrote, a contention the group will make in court on Friday. Trump's team also challenged the funds the Justice Department uses to pay for the special counsel probes – an indefinite bucket of federal funds that special counsels are allocated by Congress to do their work. In legal filings earlier this year, the special counsel defended his appointment and wrote Congress authorizes the attorney general to commission prosecutors to lead independent investigations for the Justice Department. Smith's appointment was sanctioned by special counsel regulations that have governed the work of other investigations, including that of former special counsels Robert Mueller and John Durham, who were both appointed during the Trump administration, prosecutors wrote. \"Attorneys General have long used these powers to appoint special attorneys with responsibilities like the Special Counsel's, with consistent support from Congress, the Executive Branch, and the courts,\" Smith wrote. Trump's argument resembles a failed strategy President Biden's son, Hunter Biden, has tried in his bid to dismiss two cases filed against him by another special counsel, David Weiss, who was appointed Delaware U.S. attorney by Trump. Prosecutors also argued Trump's claim that the special counsel is not properly funded \"lacks merit\" based on legal and historical precedent. Cannon has not yet set a date for the case against Trump to go to trial and is still considering numerous legal challenges posed earlier this year. The former president is accused of mishandling national defense information — including some of the federal government's most classified material — after he left office. He and two aides are also accused of engaging in an alleged scheme to obstruct the classified records probe. All three have pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. None of the defendants are required to attend the upcoming hearings, which will also deal with a proposed gag order over Trump's speech. Last month, the special counsel launched a bid to limit Trump's public comments about law enforcement on the case. Smith asked Cannon to change the former president's conditions of pretrial release to prohibit him from making comments similar to those he's made over the past few months about the case. Smith alleged Trump \"endangered law enforcement officers involved in the investigation and prosecution of this case and threatened the integrity of these proceedings.\" Federal prosecutors moved to limit Trump's public comments after he made false claims that FBI agents were \"authorized to shoot\" him as they executed a court-authorized search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago residence in August 2022. Trump was not at Mar-a-Lago during the search, in which agents recovered over 100 documents with classified markings as part of the federal probe into the former president's handling of sensitive government records. Smith alleged that Trump had \"grossly distorted these standard practices by mischaracterizing them as a plan to kill him, his family, and U.S. Secret Service agents.\" Without offering specific cases, prosecutors wrote that Trump's language \"pose[s] a significant, imminent, and foreseeable danger to the law enforcement agents\" and should be curtailed as a result. Trump's legal team pushed back and accused prosecutors of trying to limit the former president's speech on the campaign trail. Cannon is expected to consider their arguments in court Monday after hearing from each side on the matter of Smith's special counsel appointment. On Tuesday, the judge will conduct a sealed hearing over attorney-client privilege matters and in open court will hear arguments over evidentiary matters. Smith also charged the former president with four counts that amount to an alleged plot to illegally oppose the result of the 2020 presidential election. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges, and the case has been on hold while the Supreme Court considers his claims of presidential immunity from prosecution. With the Supreme Court matter still pending and Cannon's lengthy pretrial schedule, the prospects that either of Smith's cases against Trump will go to trial before the presidential election are diminished.",

                    "text": "A federal judge overseeing the classified documents case against former President Donald Trump is expected to hear arguments Friday over a motion questioning the legality of appointment of Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges.The hearing marks the start of a three-day session, with proceedings continuing into next week, according to Associated Press.It is expected to cause further delays to the trial, which was initially set for last month but has been delayed by various unresolved legal issues.Among the defense's challenges is the claim that Smith's appointment and funding by the Justice Department were improper, a motion that has thus far been unsuccessful.Special Counsel Jack Smith's team aims to advance a prosecution that many legal experts view as straightforward compared to the other three cases against Trump. However, Friday's session before U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon will focus on the legality of Smith's appointment rather than the substance of the charges.Judge Cannon, appointed by Trump, had already drawn criticism from prosecutors before the June 2023 indictment by approving Trump's request for an independent review of the classified documents seized from Mar-a-Lago. This order was later overturned by a federal appeals panel.Cannon has also faced scrutiny for her management of the case, including delays in issuing rulings and scheduling hearings on questionable claims. These decisions have made it unlikely that the trial will occur before the November presidential election.In March, prosecutors rebuked her for requesting both sides to draft jury instructions and respond to a premise they deemed fundamentally flawed.The delays in the trial come amid New York Times report that two judges, including the chief federal judge in the Southern District of Florida, had urged Cannon to recuse herself from the case. But she reportedly wanted to keep the case and refused the judges' suggestion.Central to Friday's hearing is the defense's argument that Smith's appointment by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 was illegal because it lacked Congressional approval. Smith's team counters that Garland had the authority to appoint him and delegate prosecutorial decisions. Previous special counsel appointments, such as that of Robert Mueller, have been upheld by courts.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is also set to decide whether Trump can be prosecuted by Smith's team for actions he took while in office, including allegedly scheming to overturn the 2020 election results.",

Who said what Cannon, appointed by Trump in late 2020, was approached last year by two \"more experienced colleagues on the federal bench in Florida\" who encouraged her to \"consider whether it would be better if she were to decline the high-profile case,\" the Times said. Cannon has \"scant trial experience and had previously shown unusual favor to Mr. Trump.\" \"For context,\" said Steve Benen at MSNBC, one of the jurists who approached Cannon was Cecilia Altonaga, the chief judge in the Southern District of Florida and a George W. Bush appointee. Altonaga reportedly told Cannon it would look bad to accept the case after a conservative appellate panel had forcefully reversed her decision to side with Trump in a pre-indictment challenge. Overall, her \"supervision of the case has alarmed legal experts on both sides of the aisle,\" The Hill said. What next? Cannon is \"not subject to the authority of her district court elders\" and can ignore their advice, the Times said. She has \"indefinitely postponed the trial\" even though prosecutors and Trump's lawyers \"had told her they could be ready to start this summer.\" Subscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

                    "text": "Former President Donald J. Trump’s defense team tried on Friday to persuade the judge overseeing the national security documents case to dismiss the indictment, pushing a long-shot argument that the special counsel, Jack Smith, was not properly appointed. Such defense motions are routinely denied in federal cases involving special counsels. But the judge presiding over this case, Aileen M. Cannon, has given Mr. Trump’s request extra import by holding hearings and allowing three outside lawyers time in court to make additional arguments about whether there is a constitutional mechanism for naming special counsels. “This has been very illuminating and helpful,” Judge Cannon said at the close of about four hours of arguments and a steady beat of her own questions, which often began with, “Would you agree that.” Mr. Trump’s team argued that the attorney general lacks constitutional authority to appoint someone with the powers of a special counsel. “The text of these statutes really matters,” said Emil Bove, one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers. He also argued that Mr. Smith should have been confirmed by the Senate because his position is so powerful.",

The donation's impact on the 2024 race is expected to be felt almost immediately. Within days of the contribution, the pro-Trump super political action committee, Make America Great Again Inc., said in a memo that it would begin reserving $100 million in advertising through Labor Day. The group had $34.5 million on hand at the end of April, and Mellon's contribution accounted for much of the nearly $70 million that the super PAC raised in May. On Wednesday and Thursday, the super PAC began reserving $30 million in ads to air in Georgia and Pennsylvania around the Fourth of July holiday. Mellon is now the first donor to give $100 million in disclosed federal contributions in this year's election. He was already the single largest contributor to super PACs supporting both Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running as an independent. Mellon has previously given $25 million to both. Democrats have sought to portray Kennedy as a spoiler supported by Republicans, in part by emphasizing Mellon's dual contributions and seemingly split loyalties. The pro-Kennedy super PAC has distributed quotations from the hard-to-reach Mellon, and for a blurb that appears on the cover of Mellon's upcoming book, Kennedy called the billionaire a \"maverick entrepreneur.\" It is not clear what Mellon's megadonation means for his support of Kennedy going forward. He has so far toggled between giving to support both candidates. His most recent donations to Kennedy's super PAC were two $5 million donations in April. But Mellon's $50 million gift will significantly help pro-Trump forces narrow the financial advantage that President Joe Biden and his allies have enjoyed so far. Miriam Adelson, the casino billionaire and widow of Sheldon G. Adelson, who died in 2021, has also made plans to fund a pro-Trump super PAC with at least as much money as the $90 million that her family gave in the 2020 campaign, although much of the cash has yet to arrive. Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein, the Illinois couple who are among the GOP's largest donors, each gave $5 million to the Trump super PAC in May. Billionaire energy executive Kelcy Warren also gave $5 million. But outside groups supporting Biden have already announced more than $1 billion in planned spending, anchored by a reserved $250 million in advertising from the leading pro-Biden super PAC, Future Forward. Individual donations as large as $50 million are rare in American campaigns. Other gifts of a similar size have come from candidates who self-funded their campaigns, from couples who technically split their mammoth contributions or from donors who have paid in installments over time. Until now, Make America Great Again Inc., which serves as the leading pro-Trump super PAC, has had only modest fundraising success, relying largely on Republican donors who have personal connections to the former president. In the first few months of 2024, the group raised between $7.4 million and $14.4 million a month. MAGA Inc. was originally seeded with $60 million by Trump's political action committee — which is prohibited from spending to support his candidacy — before he declared his run for president. But in a highly unusual transaction, Trump later asked for a refund of the $60 million he had given months earlier, so MAGA Inc. has now returned that amount to the PAC, Save America, which is helping pay his legal bills. Mellon, who had previously put $25 million into the group over the last 12 months, now accounts for nearly half of what the group has raised in total. Mellon has long avoided the publicity that typically surrounds a donor this significant. After bursting onto the Republican fundraising scene at the dawn of the Trump administration, he quickly developed a reputation as an unusual, quirky figure. Despite his famous last name — he is the grandson of former Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon and a member of the wealthy Mellon family — Republican fundraisers had largely not heard of him before he made a $10 million donation to a GOP super PAC in mid-2018. That gift was the first of nine eight-figure checks that he would cut to major Republican groups. He would go on to hire political counsel to guide him in Washington, although he lives primarily in Wyoming these days. Few recipients of his money have even met him. The $50 million check to support Trump is matched only by a different donation Mellon made on behalf of another tough-on-immigration political project: the private construction of a border wall in Texas. In August 2021, Mellon donated $53 million worth of stock to help pay for the wall, a priority of Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas. Mellon, who did not respond to requests for comment Thursday, appears to be growing more comfortable with the scrutiny of his influence. Next month, he is slated to publish a book, \"panam.captain,\" about his work turning around Pan Am Systems, a collection of companies that includes rail, aviation and marketing firms. Mellon originally self-published an autobiography, but it was taken offline in 2016 after some incendiary passages became public, including a line that Black people were \"even more belligerent\" after social programs were expanded in the 1960s and '70s. Mellon also wrote that social safety net programs amounted to \"slavery redux.\" \"For delivering their votes in the Federal Elections, they are awarded with yet more and more freebies: food stamps, cellphones, WIC payments, Obamacare, and on, and on,\" Mellon wrote, according to The Washington Post. The new book will be released by Skyhorse Publishing. Its president is Tony Lyons, who co-founded the pro-Kennedy super PAC, American Values 2024. In a rare interview with Bloomberg in 2020, Mellon praised what he saw as Trump's follow-through: \"He's done the things he promised to, or tried to do the things he's promised to,\" he said.

By far, Mr. Mellon is now the former president’s largest single supporter.Backing RFK Jr.Along with former President Trump, Mr. Mellon is a significant backer of independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presidential campaign. Since the beginning of 2023, Mr. Mellon has given $30 million to American Values 2024. American Values is a hybrid PAC supporting Mr. Kennedy’s run. The donor connection between former President Trump and Mr. Kennedy is leading Democrats to speculate that the Kennedy candidacy exists purely to spoil the election for President Joe Biden.

FILE PHOTO: Donald Trump's campaign outraised President Joe Biden's campaign again in May. Getty Images Key Facts Citing federal filings, several reports said Mellon donated $50 million to pro-Trump super PAC, Make America Great Again Inc., on the same day the former president was convicted on 34 felony charges in the New York hush-money case. Mellon’s donation is now the largest individual contribution of the 2024 election season and the conservative billionaire is the first to disclose more than $100 million in overall campaign contributions this year. Mellon’s donation made up a lion’s share of the $68.8 billion raised by MAGA Inc. in May—and a major boost for the super PAC, which already had $34.4 million on hand at the end of April. The massive contribution from Mellon led a bumper fundraising month for the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, as they received $141 million compared to the $85 million raised by the Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee. This is the second consecutive month where Trump has outraised Biden—cutting sharply into the President’s fundraising advantage.

Surprising Fact Last year, Mellon made a $5 million donation to Robert F. Kennedy’s Democratic Primary campaign. At the time, Mellon praised Kennedy by calling him the “one candidate who can unite the country and root out corruption and that he’s the one Democrat who can win in the general election.” What To Watch For Earlier this month, MAGA Inc. reportedly told its donors it plans to spend $100 million through Labor Day.

                    "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Timothy Mellon, heir to the billionaire Mellon family banking fortune, has become one of the Republican Party’s biggest financial backers throughout former President Donald Trump’s rise in politics, donating at least $75 million to a pro-Trump group after previously supporting a southern border wall-building effort—and bankrolling Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s candidacy. Former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally at Sunset Park on Sunday, June 9, 2024, in Las ... [+] Vegas. (Madeline Carter/Las Vegas Review-Journal/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) TNS Key Facts Mellon donated $50 million—one of the largest political donations ever—to the main super PAC backing Trump’s candidacy, Make America Great Again, Inc., the day after Trump was convicted by a Manhattan jury in May, according to Federal Election Commission filings made public Thursday. Prior to Thursday’s filings, 81-year-old Mellon was already the biggest political donor of this election cycle, giving $25 million each to MAGA Inc. and the American Values super PAC backing Kennedy. The Mellon family fortune dates back to the 19th century: He’s the great-grandson of banker Thomas Mellon (founder of Mellon Bank) and grandson of former Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, and members of his family were early investors in the company that later became Gulf Oil. Timothy Mellon founded a computer programming company in the 1960s shortly after his graduation from Yale University in 1964, then took over regional freight railroads in New England starting in 1981, later merging his rail company with the bankrupt Pan American World Airways, and briefly operating a Pan Am-branded regional airline service under the merger. Known as a reclusive figure even to his political beneficiaries, Mellon has largely avoided the public eye, spending most of his time living on his ranch in Wyoming, according to Bloomberg, which conducted a rare interview with the billionaire in 2020, after he donated $10 million to America First Action, a super PAC backing Trump’s re-election bid. Trump has “done the things he promised to do, or tried to,” Mellon said at the time, specifically noting Trump’s work “in trade and righting the balance between our country and the rest of the world, especially China.” Mellon made his first major political donation, $10 million, to a GOP super PAC in 2018, according to the New York Times, and in 2021, he gave $53 million to Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s private fundraising campaign to build a border wall; Mellon also gave $1.5 million in 2010 to help the state of Arizona defend a controversial law that required police to determine the immigration status of people suspected of living in the U.S. illegally, which critics said could lead to racial profiling, according to the Washington Post.

Chief Critic After his major donations to Trump and the GOP in 2020, the Washington Post discovered Mellon used racial stereotypes in his 2015 self-published autobiography. He described social safety net programs as “slavery redux,” wrote Black people became “even more belligerent” after welfare expansion in the 1960s and 1970s and opined that “for delivering their votes in the Federal Elections,” welfare recipients are “awarded with yet more and more freebies: food stamps, cellphones, WIC payments, Obamacare, and on, and on.” Forbes Valuation We estimate the Mellon family is worth $14.1 billion, making them America’s 34th-wealthiest family as of this year. Surprising Fact Mellon once aligned with liberal causes. Shortly after his graduation from Yale, he established a foundation aimed at addressing racial disparities in education, the economy and the criminal justice system, and he voted for incumbent Democratic President Lyndon Johnson in the 1964 presidential election, he wrote in his autobiography, according to the Washington Post. Mellon eventually dissolved the foundation, distributing its funds to conservative causes, after coming to the conclusion that he and his foundation partners “overlooked some fundamental attributes of human behavior that would have precluded success,” he reportedly wrote in his book. Key Background Trump has now surpassed President Joe Biden’s early cash advantage, out-fundraising the president in May for the second month in a row, bolstered by his conviction in Manhattan last month on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee reported raising $141 million in May, including $70 million it said it raised in the first 48 hours after his conviction, compared to $85 million raised by the Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee. For the first time this cycle, Trump’s campaign ended May with more cash on hand ($116.5 million) than Biden ($91.6 million). The totals do not include money raised by super PACs supporting the candidates, such as MAGA Inc. or the pro-Biden Future Forward USA Action, which are technically separate from the campaigns and legally prohibited from coordinating with Trump or Biden. Mellon’s donations to MAGA Inc. make up nearly half the money it’s raised this election cycle, and account for the bulk of the $70 million it reported raising in May, according to the New York Times. Tangent Trump has amassed a coalition of billionaire donors since clinching the nomination in March. Energy Transfer pipeline company founder Kelcy Warren gave at least $800,000 to Trump’s campaign apparatus, the Trump 47 committee, in the first quarter of the year after donating to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ primary bid. Former chairman and CEO of Marvel Entertainment, Isaac Perlmutter and his wife, Laura, gave $10.1 million to a new pro-Trump super PAC, Right for America, in the first quarter. TD Ameritrade Chairman J. Joe Ricketts, former casino mogul Steve Wynn and Los Angeles real estate magnate Geoffrey Palmer also gave more than $800,000 to Trump 47. Other billionaires have expressed plans to soon make contributions, including Blackstone CEO and co-founder Steve Schwarzman, Casino mogul and longtime Trump backer Miriam Adelson and Uline shipping and packaging company’s Liz Uihlein and Dick Uihlein. What To Watch For Mellon is expected to publish a new book, “panam.captain,” described as a “business memoir” about “his journey from the legacy of the Mellon family to his success as an audacious entrepreneur” next month. Kennedy is quoted on the cover calling Mellon a “maverick entrepreneur.” Further Reading Single Biggest Trump Campaign Donation Revealed: Timothy Mellon Donates $50 Million To MAGA PAC (Forbes) These Are The Billionaires Supporting Trump’s Campaign (Forbes) Follow me on Twitter.

                    "text": "WASHINGTON >> The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said today it is investigating a Southwest Airlines flight that descended to a low altitude 9 miles (14.5 km) from the Oklahoma City airport. The incident involving Southwest Airlines Flight 4069, which had departed from Las Vegas, occurred around at 12:05 a.m. Wednesday, the FAA said. After the automated Minimum Safe Altitude Warning sounded, an air traffic controller alerted the flight crew. Southwest said it is following its Safety Management System and is in contact with the FAA to “understand and address any irregularities with the aircraft’s approach to the airport.” Several incidents involving Southwest flights in recent months have raised concerns. Asked on Monday if the incidents would prompt the agency to boost scrutiny of Southwest, as it has with United Airlines , FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker declined to comment. He said the agency reviewed all airline incidents and closely monitored carriers. “The airline oversight model is a pretty good model that we want to build out for other players in the system,” Whitaker said. Last week, the FAA and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said they were investigating a May 25 Southwest flight of a Boeing 737 MAX. The NTSB said the plane experienced a “Dutch roll” at 34,000 feet while en route from Phoenix, to Oakland, California. Such lateral asymmetric movements are named after a Dutch ice-skating technique and can pose serious safety risks. The FAA said last week it was also investigating a Southwest 737 MAX 8 flight in April that came within about 400 feet of the ocean off the coast of Hawaii after bad weather conditions prompted pilots to bypass a landing attempt at Lihue airport, on the island of Kauai. During the go-around, the first officer “inadvertently pushed forward on the control column while following thrust lever movement commanded by the autothrottle,” according to a June 7 airline memo, and the plane began to descend rapidly, hitting a maximum descent rate of about 4,400 feet per minute. The pilots in a post-debrief said seeing the severity of the flight “through the animations was a significant, emotional event,” the Southwest memo said, adding the airline is reviewing data and trends related to its procedures, training, standards, and performance.",

                    "text": "A Southwest Airlines flight is being investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration after it flew at an abnormally low altitude over Oklahoma. Flight 4069 was flying over Yukon, Okla. when it reached a low altitude of 525 feet on Wednesday, June 19, CNN reports. Air traffic controllers at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City were alerted that the aircraft was getting too low after it triggered a Minimum Safe Altitude Warning, according to the FAA. “After an automated warning sounded, an air traffic controller alerted the crew of Southwest Airlines Flight 4069 that the aircraft had descended to a low altitude nine miles away from Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City,” the FAA tells PEOPLE in a statement. “The FAA is investigating the incident that occurred around 12:05 a.m. local time on Wednesday, June 19.” During the flight, an air traffic controller reportedly asked the pilot, “You good out there?” after alerting them of the plane’s low altitude, CNN reports. In a statement from Southwest, the airline confirmed that the aircraft, a Boeing 737-800, landed safely at the Oklahoma City airport. “Southwest is following its robust Safety Management System and is in contact with the Federal Aviation Administration to understand and address any irregularities with the aircraft’s approach to the airport,” the airline added. “Nothing is more important to Southwest than the Safety of our Customers and Employees.” In December 2022, a United Airlines Boeing 777 reached a low altitude of 800 feet as it was flying over the Pacific Ocean on its way to Maui, Hawaii. It was later determined in August 2023 by the National Transportation Safety Board that the incident was a result of pilot error.

The NTSB report states that the Boeing 777 made a dramatic drop due to “the flight crew’s failure to manage the vertical flightpath, airspeed, and pitch altitude.” In the conclusion of the report, it was confirmed that the incident occurred because of a “miscommunication” between the two pilots about the “captain’s desired flap setting” during takeoff.",

                    "text": "The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating a Southwest Airlines fight after it flew several hundred feet above a neighborhood in Yukon, Oklahoma. Shortly after 12am on Wednesday, Southwest flight 4069 – a Boeing 737 from Las Vegas – was approximately nine miles away from Oklahoma City’s Will Rogers World airport when it dipped to approximately 525ft above Yukon, according to flight data from Flightradar24.com. The descent prompted a low-altitude alert from an air-traffic controller. In a recording reported by LiveATC.net, an air-traffic controller can be heard saying: “Southwest 4069, low-altitude alert. You good out there?” “Yeah, we’re going around, 4069,” the pilot responds. The air-traffic controller can then be heard instructing the pilot to ascend to an altitude of 3,000 feet. The plane eventually landed safely at the airport with no injuries reported. Nevertheless, the low descent startled several residents including Spencer Basoco, who lives close to Yukon high school, where the flight is reported to have hit its lowest altitude, according to KFOR. Speaking to KFOR, Basoco said: “I was kind of like halfway in between sleep, being awake, and I just hear this whoosh … And I thought at first, like a storm was blowing in … because it just sounded like a wall of wind. And I looked out the window where the sound was coming from … if you go a few blocks away is the high school. And I just see a plane.” Posting in the Yukon Happenings Facebook group, one resident wrote: “It woke me up and I thought it was gonna hit my house,” the Oklahoman reports. Following the incident, the FAA said in a statement: “After an automated warning sounded, an air-traffic controller alerted the crew of Southwest Airlines Flight 4069 that the aircraft had descended to a low altitude nine miles away from Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City.” It added that it was investigating the incident. In a statement reported by the Associated Press, Southwest Airlines said: “Southwest is following its robust safety management system and is in contact with the Federal Aviation Administration to understand and address any irregularities with the aircraft’s approach to the airport. “Nothing is more important to Southwest than the safety of our customers and employees,” the airline added. Southwest’s latest incident follows reports of the FAA investigating another one of its flights after a Boeing 737 plunged at a rate of 4,000ft a minute off the coast of Hawaii in April. According to a memo distributed to the airline’s pilots and reviewed by Bloomberg, the plane was en route to Honolulu from Lihue when it rapidly descended to approximately 400ft above the Pacific Ocean. The airline had another incident in May when a Boeing 737 suffered damage to parts of its structure after it did a “Dutch roll” during a flight in May. A Dutch roll occurs when a plane’s tail slides side to side while its wings roll up and down. The plane was bound from Phoenix, Arizona, to Oakland, California, and was flying at approximately 34,000ft when the incident happened. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, Southwest “performed maintenance on the airplane and discovered damage to structural components”.",

After that, the moon moves from Sagittarius into the full moon Capricorn, which peaks at 8:08 p.m. Chicago time. Aries (March 21-April 19) Today you might have a better idea if travel plans are feasible or not. You certainly want a change of scenery and a chance to explore, whether it’s camping or extensive travel. Something will happen that lets you know what is possible. Taurus (April 20-May 20) Be careful with financial decisions, especially regarding shared property, taxes and inheritances because fuzzy thinking could lead you down the wrong path. Fortunately, by the end of the day, you will know what is possible and what is not. Do your homework. Gemini (May 21-June 20) Don’t agree to anything important when talking to partners and close friends because things are nebulous and some things are not as they appear. Therefore, wait until you see how everything unfolds. At the last minute, hopefully, you will see what to do. Cancer (June 21-July 22) Avoid hasty decisions today, especially with your health, your job or work-related travel. It’s important to know what the rules and regulations are — and what you can do and what you can’t do. After the moon changes signs at the end of the day, things will be clearer. Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) Social plans as well as issues with kids are confusing today. This could lead to feelings of disappointment. Make sure that others know what your expectations are. By the end of the day, the dust will settle and you’ll have a realistic assessment of things. Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) You might have increased responsibilities or burdens related to family, parents or older relatives today. Do what you can because that’s all you can do. Postpone making important decisions until this evening because that is when you might have the most clarity. Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22) Relax. It’s easy to be worried today. That’s because things tend to look worse than they really are. When your perspective includes the suffering of others in the world, your own suffering looks comparatively small. Everything is relative, isn’t it? Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21) Tread carefully today when dealing with financial matters or making financial decisions because you may not have all the facts. Something might look better than it is. Someone might even deceive you today — it’s possible. Wait until the last moment this evening to make your decision. Sagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21) Today life tends to look worse than it really is. This is why you might feel down or depressed. But this is a temporary dark cloud on your horizon. Furthermore, there is an element of confusion present. Wait until late in the day for clarity — one hopes. Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) Don’t worry if you have feelings of loneliness or you feel cut off from others because many people feel this way today. Many people feel confused and discouraged. Fortunately, by the evening, you might see things in a new light, and you’ll know what to do. Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) Financial disappointments, especially related to a friend or a group, might occur today. You might feel unappreciated. You might even feel deceived. You might feel, “I did not sign up for this.” However, confusion can create wrong impressions. Wait until this evening to see how things really are. Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20) Be leery of following the advice of authority figures today because an element of confusion exists. Someone might not have the full facts. They might not see the complete picture. Because of this, they might give flawed advice. Wait until the end of the day to see what is really possible. If Your Birthday Is Today William, Prince of Wales (1982) shares your birthday. You are busy, social, sensuous, exciting and sometimes obsessed. You are talented and strongly individualistic. (Be careful about driving yourself to exhaustion.) This is a powerful year for you and a busy one. Leadership, promotions, kudos, praise and awards will come your way. Bravo!",

You can find them here: ForbesToday's 'Connections' Hints And Answers For Friday, June 21By Kris Holt Hey, folks! I hope your weekend is off to a smashing start. Let’s keep the good times going by maintaining your Connections streak. Today’s NYT Connections hints and answers are coming right up. How To Play Connections In Connections, you’re presented with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to arrange them into four groups of four by figuring out the links between them. The groups could be things like horror movie franchises, a type of verb or rappers. There’s only one solution for each puzzle, and you’ll need to be careful when it comes to words that might fit into more than one category. You can shuffle the words to perhaps help you see links between them. Each group is color coded. The yellow group is usually the easiest to figure out, blue and green fall in the middle, and the purple group is typically the hardest one to deduce. The purple group often involves wordplay, so bear that in mind.

If you make a guess and you’re incorrect, you’ll lose a life. If you’re close to having a correct group, you might see a message telling you that you’re one word away from getting it right, but you’ll still need to figure out which one to swap. If you make four mistakes, it’s game over. Let’s make sure that doesn’t happen with the help of some hints, and, if you’re really struggling, today’s Connections answers. What Are Today’s Connections Hints? Scroll slowly! Just after the hints for each of today’s Connections groups, I’ll reveal what the groups are without immediately telling you which words go into them. Today’s 16 words are... FRANK STRING WOOD RING DOG FOG TRAIN BIRDS CHAIN LINK IRON BRAT DRIVER OMEN SERIES WEDGE And the hints for today’s groups are: Yellow group — sequence Green group — stalwarts of The Open Blue group — scary pictures Purple group — these are all bangers, so to speak What Are Today’s Connections Groups? Need some extra help? Be warned: we’re starting to get into spoiler territory. Today’s groups are... Yellow group — one thing after another Green group — kinds of golf clubs Blue group — horror movies, with “The” Purple group — words for sausage What Are Today’s Connections Answers? Spoiler alert! Don’t scroll any further down the page until you’re ready to find out today’s Connections answers. This is your final warning! Today’s Connections answers are... Yellow group — one thing after another (CHAIN, SERIES, STRING, TRAIN) Green group — kinds of golf clubs (DRIVER, IRON, WEDGE, WOOD) Blue group — horror movies, with “The” (BIRDS, FOG, OMEN, RING) Purple group — words for sausage (BRAT, DOG, FRANK, LINK) Another perfect game, and my winning streak is up to 32 overall. I got the blues pretty much as soon as I saw OMEN. The greens were straightforward enough too. I ran into a little trouble with the last two groups. I included LINK in my first two guesses before deducing the yellows. That left the purple group, for which I’m pleased to say I figured out the connection before submitting it. That’s all there is to it for today’s Connections clues and answers. Be sure to check my blog for hints and the solution for Sunday’s game if you need them. P.S. If you're suddenly in the mood for a horror movie that starts with “The,” allow me to suggest The Mist. It reteams director Frank Darabont with source material from Stephen King (a combo that worked out terrifically with The Shawshank Redemption) for a dark tale about dangers both unseen and in plain sight.

You can find them here: ForbesNYT 'Strands' #110 Hints, Spangram And Answers For Friday, June 21stBy Erik Kain Hello there! I hope your weekend’s off to a great start. Let’s get down to business, shall we? Today’s NYT Strands hints, spangram and answers are coming right up. How To Play Strands The New York Times’ Strands puzzle is a play on the classic word search. It’s in beta for now, which means it’ll only stick around if enough people play it every day. There’s a new game of Strands to play every day. The game will present you with a six by eight grid of letters. The aim is to find a group of words that have something in common, and you’ll get a clue as to what that theme is. When you find a theme word, it will remain highlighted in blue. You’ll also need to find a special word called a spangram. This tells you what the words have in common. The spangram links at least two sides of the board, but it may not start or end there. While the theme words will not be a proper name, the spangram can be a proper name. When you find the spangram, it will remain highlighted in yellow. MORE FOR YOU Single Biggest Trump Campaign Donation Revealed: Timothy Mellon Donates $50 Million To MAGA PAC Trump Documents Case: Judge Cannon Considers Jack Smith’s Appointment Today—What To Know Trump's New Attack On Judge Behind His $454 Million Fraud Penalty Explained Every letter is used once in one of the theme words and spangram. You can connect letters vertically, horizontally and diagonally, and it’s possible to switch directions in the middle of a word. If you’re playing on a touchscreen, double tap the last letter to submit your guess. If you find three valid words of at least four letters that are not part of the theme, you’ll unlock the Hint button. Clicking this will highlight the letters that make up one of the theme words. Be warned: You’ll need to be on your toes. Sometimes you’ll need to fill the missing word(s) in a phrase. On other days, the game may revolve around synonyms or homophones. The difficulty will vary from day to day, and the puzzle creators will try to surprise you sometimes. What Is Today’s Strands Hint? Scroll slowly! Just after the hint for today’s Strands puzzle, I’ll reveal what the answer words are. The official theme hint for today’s Strand puzzle is... I love the nightlife Need some extra help? Here’s another hint... After-dark denizens There are seven theme words to find today, including the spangram. What Are Today’s Strands Answers? Spoiler alert! Don’t scroll any further down the page until you’re ready to find out today’s Strands answers. I’ll first tell you the spangram and show you where that is on the grid. I’ll then tell you the other words and show you how they fit in. This is your final warning! Today’s Strands spangram is... NOCTURNAL Here’s where you’ll find it on the grid... New York Times Strands screenshot, showing the highlighted term NOCTURNAL. New York Times The rest of today’s Strands theme words are... WOMBAT COYOTE LEOPARD AARDVARK SKUNK OPOSSUM Here’s what the completed grid looks like... Completed Strands grid for June 22 featuring the words WOMBAT, NOCTURNAL, COYOTE, LEOPARD, AARDVARK, ... [+] SKUNK and OPOSSUM. New York Times I saw MOTOWN at the top of the grid right away, but that wasn’t a valid word. Hmm. Looking at the corners, I eventually found SKUNK in the bottom right. That gave me an indication that I was looking for nocturnal animals. Sure enough, I found WOMBAT in the top left next, then the spangram. Annoyingly, POSSUM in the bottom left was not one of the theme words, but OPOSSUM was. Hmph. That left LEOPARD on the left. I then found COYOTE and AARDVARK to seal the win. I didn't use any hints and the spangram was the third theme word I found. That’s all there is to it for today’s Strands clues and answers. Be sure to check my blog for hints and the solution for Sunday’s game if you need them. P.S. I can’t see the word “Wombat” and not include a song from The Wombats. This is my favourite of theirs, though they have a bunch of great tunes. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out some of my other work here.

Lots of new shows and movies to watch. Beautiful sunny weather to bask in! Elden Ring’s big Shadow of the Erdtree expansion to carve my way through. Glorious! And, of course, there is today’s Wordle, which I’m feeling rather good about if I do say so myself. Today is Wordle #1099. Tomorrow we begin the 1100s’ leaving us with just 900 Wordles to go before we reach 2000 and 11 Wordles before we reach #1111. Let’s begin! How To Solve Today’s Wordle The Hint: Proclomation. The Clue: This Wordle begins with a vowel. Okay, spoilers below! . . Can you solve today’s phrase? Play Now . The Answer: Today's Wordle Credit: Erik Kain Wordle Analysis Every day I check Wordle Bot to help analyze my guessing game. You can check your Wordles with Wordle Bot right here. Happy day! Happiest of days! I had no idea that guessing PRICE—which I thought of because I was thinking about Captain Price from the Call Of Duty games—would leave me with just two remaining guesses. Wordle Bot says they would have picked EVICT in my shoes (and they did pick it for their third guess) but that’s because the Bot thinks like a landlord and I’ve had too many bad landlords to guess EVICT. I went with EDICT and snagged a hole in two. Huzzah! Competitive Wordle Score I get 2 points for guessing in two and 1 for beating the Bot, who took four. 3 points! Huzzah! How To Play Competitive Wordle Guessing in 1 is worth 3 points; guessing in 2 is worth 2 points; guessing in 3 is worth 1 point; guessing in 4 is worth 0 points; guessing in 5 is -1 points; guessing in 6 is -2 points and missing the Wordle is -3 points. If you beat your opponent you get 1 point. If you tie, you get 0 points. And if you lose to your opponent, you get -1 point. Add it up to get your score. Keep a daily running score or just play for a new score each day. Today’s Wordle Etymology The word \"edict\" has its origins in the Latin word \"edictum,\" which means \"proclamation\" or \"decree.\" It comes from the verb \"edicere,\" which is composed of the prefix \"e-\" (a variant of \"ex-,\" meaning \"out\") and \"dicere,\" meaning \"to say\" or \"to declare.\" Therefore, \"edictum\" literally means \"something declared or proclaimed.\" The term was adopted into Middle English as \"edict\" in the late 14th century, maintaining its meaning as a public decree or official order issued by an authority.

I don't like it as a Quordle / Wordle word though, because it can be difficult to solve; a B at the end of an answer is not particularly common, plus there are lots of words that can start SH---. That aside today's words aren't too tough, although the repeated H in HARSH may trip people up. It cost me a guess, when I went for MARSH first, but that was my only mishap. How did you do today?

Today's game was another straightforward one. After my disasters earlier in the week I feel like I'm back in the swing of things, which is ironic given that one of the groups today relates to golf.

                    "text": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s military said Friday that it had fired warnings shots the previous day to repel North Korean soldiers who temporarily crossed the rivals’ land border for the third time this month. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said several North Korean soldiers while engaging in unspecified construction work on the northern side of the border briefly intruded the military demarcation line that bisects the countries at around 11 a.m. Thursday. The South Korean military in response broadcasted a warning and fired warning shots, to which the North Korean soldiers retreated. The joint chiefs didn’t immediately release more details. South Korea’s military has said it believes the previous two border intrusions this month weren’t intentional as the North Korean soldiers have retreated after the warning shots and the North has not returned fire. The South’s military says it has been observing increased North Korean construction activity in frontline border areas since April, such as installing suspected anti-tank barriers, reinforcing roads and planting land mines. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story is below: A South Korea activists’ group said Friday it again flew large balloons carrying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets toward North Korea, adding to a campaign that aggravated animosities between the rivals and prompted a resumption of Cold War-style psychological warfare along their border. The South Korean civilian group, led by North Korean defector Park Sang-hak, said it floated 20 balloons attached with 300,000 propaganda leaflets, 5,000 USB sticks with South Korean pop songs and TV dramas, and 3,000 U.S. dollar bills from the South Korean border town of Paju on Thursday night. Pyongyang resents such material and fears it could demoralize front-line troops and residents and eventually weaken leader Kim Jong Un’s grip on power, analysts say. After previous leafletting by Park’s group and other South Korean activists, North Korean launched more than 1,000 balloons that dropped tons of trash in South Korea, smashing roof tiles and windows and causing other property damage. In retaliation for the trash balloons, South Korea resumed anti-North Korea propaganda broadcasts with military loudspeakers installed at the border for the first time in years, to which Pyongyang warned that Seoul was “creating a prelude to a very dangerous situation.” Tensions between the Koreas are at their highest in years as Kim accelerates his nuclear weapons and missile development and attempts to strengthen his regional footing by aligning with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a standoff against the U.S.-led West. On Thursday, South Korea’s government condemned an agreement by Kim and Putin at their summit this week in which their nations vowed to come to each other’s defense in the event of war. In turn, Seoul said it will consider sending arms to Ukraine to help it fight Russia’s invasion. South Korea, a growing arms exporter with a well-equipped military backed by the United States, has provided humanitarian aid and other support to Ukraine while joining U.S.-led economic sanctions against Moscow. But it has not directly provided arms to Ukraine, citing a long-standing policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflict. Putin told reporters in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Thursday that supplying weapons to Ukraine would be “a very big mistake” on South Korea’s part. He also said South Korea “shouldn’t worry” about the agreement, if Seoul isn’t planning any aggression against Pyongyang. North Korea is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism about Kim’s authoritarian rule and his absolute control over its people, most of whom have little access to foreign news. South Korea’s military said there are signs that North Korea was installing its own speakers at the border, although they weren’t yet working. The South’s military has also observed the North deploying large numbers of soldiers in frontline areas to build suspected anti-tank barriers, reinforce roads and plant mines in an apparent attempt to fortify their side of the border. Seoul believes the efforts are possibly aimed at preventing North Korean civilians and soldiers from escaping to the South as Kim’s government tries to strengthen its control over people. In 2015, when South Korea restarted loudspeaker broadcasts for the first time in 11 years, North Korea fired artillery rounds across the border, prompting South Korea to return fire, according to South Korean officials.

                    "text": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea summoned the Russian ambassador to protest the country’s new defense pact with North Korea on Friday, as border tensions continued to rise with vague threats and brief, seemingly accidental incursions by North Korean troops. Earlier Friday, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued a vague threat of retaliation after South Korean activists flew balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets across the border, and South Korea’s military said it had fired warning shots the previous day to repel North Korean soldiers who briefly crossed the rivals’ land border for the third time this month. That came two days after Moscow and Pyongyang reached a pact vowing mutual defense assistance if either is attacked, and a day after Seoul responded by saying it would consider providing arms to Ukraine to fight Russia’s invasion. South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Hong Kyun summoned Russian Ambassador Georgy Zinoviev to convey Seoul’s stance on the deal between Putin and Kim and on alleged military cooperation between Russia and North Korea. Seoul’s Foreign Ministry didn’t immediately confirm what was said during the meeting. Leafletting campaigns by South Korean civilian activists in recent weeks have prompted a resumption of Cold War-style psychological warfare along the inter-Korean border. The South Korean civilian activists, led by North Korean defector Park Sang-hak, said it sent 20 balloons carrying 300,000 propaganda leaflets, 5,000 USB sticks with South Korean pop songs and TV dramas, and 3,000 U.S. dollar bills from the South Korean border town of Paju on Thursday night. Pyongyang resents such material and fears it could demoralize front-line troops and residents and eventually weaken Kim Jong Un’s grip on power, analysts say. In a statement carried by North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency, Kim Yo Jong, one of her brother’s top foreign policy officials, called the activists “defector scum” and issued what appeared to be a threat of retaliation. “When you do something you were clearly warned not to do, it’s only natural that you will find yourself dealing with something you didn’t have to,” she said, without specifying what the North would do. After previous leafletting by South Korean activists, North Korea launched more than 1,000 balloons that dropped tons of trash in South Korea, smashing roof tiles and windows and causing other property damage. Kim Yo Jong previously hinted that balloons could become the North’s standard response to leafletting, saying that the North would respond by “scattering dozens of times more rubbish than is being scattered on us.” In response, South Korea resumed anti-North Korea propaganda broadcasts with military loudspeakers installed at the border for the first time in years, to which Kim Yo Jong, in another state media statement, warned that Seoul was “creating a prelude to a very dangerous situation.” Tensions between the Koreas are at their highest in years as Kim Jong Un accelerates his nuclear weapons and missile development and attempts to strengthen his regional footing by aligning with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a standoff against the U.S.-led West. South Korea, a growing arms exporter with a well-equipped military backed by the United States, says it is considering upping support for Ukraine in response. Seoul has already provided humanitarian aid and other support while joining U.S.-led economic sanctions against Moscow. But it has not directly provided arms, citing a long-standing policy of not supplying weapons to countries actively engaged in conflict. Putin told reporters in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Thursday that supplying weapons to Ukraine would be “a very big mistake,” and said South Korea “shouldn’t worry” about the agreement if it isn’t planning aggression against Pyongyang. North Korea is extremely sensitive to criticism of Kim’s authoritarian rule and efforts to reach its people with foreign news and other media. In 2015, when South Korea restarted loudspeaker broadcasts for the first time in 11 years, North Korea fired artillery rounds across the border, prompting South Korea to return fire, according to South Korean officials. No casualties were reported. South Korea’s military said there are signs that North Korea was installing its own speakers at the border, although they weren’t yet working. In the latest border incident, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said several North Korean soldiers engaged in unspecified construction work briefly crossed the military demarcation line that divides the two countries at around 11 a.m. Thursday. The South Korean military broadcast a warning and fired warning shots, after which the North Korean soldiers retreated. The joint chiefs didn’t immediately release more details, including why it was releasing the information a day late. South Korea’s military says believes recent border intrusions were not intentional, as the North Korean soldiers have not returned fire and retreated after the warning shots. The South’s military has observed the North deploying large numbers of soldiers in frontline areas to build suspected anti-tank barriers, reinforce roads and plant mines in an apparent attempt to fortify their side of the border. Seoul believes the efforts are likely aimed at preventing North Korean civilians and soldiers from escaping to the South.",

                    "text": "SEOUL, June 21 (UPI) -- North Korean soldiers working in the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas briefly crossed the border, prompting South Korean troops to fire warning shots, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said Friday. The incident occurred around 11 a.m. on Thursday, the JCS said in a message to reporters. \"Several North Korean soldiers working within the DMZ on the central frontlines crossed the [military demarcation line] and headed back north after our military made warning broadcasts and fired warning shots,\" the JCS said. The incursion was the third crossing by the North in recent weeks, with similar incidents taking place on Tuesday and June 9. JCS officials said the crossings appear unintentional, as the North has been ramping up activity in frontline areas of the DMZ since withdrawing from an inter-Korean military agreement in November. North Korean soldiers have been observed clearing land, laying mines, reinforcing tactical roads and installing structures that appear to be anti-tank barriers at several locations in the DMZ. Earlier this week, the JCS said that the work has been carrying on despite \"numerous casualties\" caused by landmine explosions. Tensions remain high near the DMZ, with North Korea sending trash-filled balloons across the border earlier this month and the South resuming anti-Pyongyang loudspeaker broadcasts. An activist group of North Korean defectors said Friday that it floated 20 balloons carrying 300,000 anti-Pyongyang leaflets, USB drives containing South Korean media and U.S. dollars across the border. The group, Fighters for a Free North Korea, said it sent the balloons on Thursday night from the border city of Paju, according to local media reports. North Korea has reacted with fury in the past to defectors sending balloons across the border. In June 2020, Pyongyang severed all communications with Seoul and blew up an inter-Korean liaison office over what it called South Korea's failure to rein in the defectors. On Friday, Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, issued a statement condemning the latest balloon launch by \"disgusting defectors\" and warning of possible retaliation. \"The border area of the DPRK was again littered with dirty wastepaper and things,\" Kim said in the statement, which was carried by state-run Korean Central News Agency. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the official name of North Korea. \"It is natural that there would be [some] trouble to happen as they did again what they had been urged not to do,\" Kim said.",

                    "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — As Ajay Stone strolled around historic Rickwood Field and gazed at tributes displayed in honor of Willie Mays and other Negro Leaguers, he clutched a cherished memory under his arm. It was a picture from 2004 of Mays holding Stone’s then-10-month-old daughter Haley, who was wearing San Francisco Giants gear. In Mays’ hand was a chunk of a chocolate chip cookie, which he was handing over for Haley to eat. “Willie gave her that cookie. She had no teeth,” Stone remembered. “But we took the cookie and we kept it in her stroller for a year and a half. The great Willie Mays gave it to her, so it was special to us.” Stone and his wife Christina traveled from Charlotte, North Carolina, to be in Birmingham, Alabama, on Thursday for a moment they deemed just as special. It was hours before Rickwood Field hosted its first Major League Baseball game between the Giants and St. Louis Cardinals. The game, which MLB called “A Tribute to the Negro Leagues,” was meant to honor the legacy of Mays and other Black baseball greats who left an enduring mark on the sport. MLB planned a week of activities around Mays and the Negro Leagues, including an unveiling ceremony on Wednesday of a Willie Mays mural in downtown Birmingham. Those tributes took on a more significant meaning Tuesday afternoon when Mays died at 93. As news of his death spread throughout Birmingham, celebrations of his life ramped up. You could hear the celebration at Rickwood Field on Thursday even before arriving at the ballpark with the rapid thumping of a drum echoing from inside the ballpark, excited murmurs from fans skipping toward the music and frequent bursts of laughter. Inside, there were reminders of history all around. There were photos and artifacts of baseball Hall of Famers who played at the 114-year-old ballpark, including Jackie Robinson, Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige. The original clubhouse of the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues, where Mays got his pro start in 1948, was open. A memorial of Mays was at the front, with bobbleheads, a signed glove and his Black Barons and San Francisco Giants jerseys on display. Outside, fans stood in line to hold a baseball bat used by Mays in 1959. They took photos sitting inside an original bus from 1947 that was typically used during barnstorming tours by Negro Leagues teams. They danced to live music and ate food from concession stands featuring menu boards designed to reflect the look and feel of the 1940s. Eddie Torres and his son Junior wore matching Giants jerseys as they took pictures inside the ballpark. They’re lifelong Giants fans who came from California for the game. “I never even got to see Willie Mays play, but as a Giants fan, you knew what he meant to the game of baseball,” Torres said. “My son, he’s only 11. Willie Mays had such an effect on the game that even he knew who Willie Mays was.” Musical artist Jon Batiste strummed a guitar while dancing on a wooden stage near home plate just before the first pitch. Fans stood as former Negro Leaguers were helped to the field for a pregame ceremony. Shouts of “Willie! Willie! broke out after a brief moment of silence. For Michael Jackson, sitting in the stands at Rickwood Field reminded him of the past. The 71-year-old Jackson played baseball in the 1970s and 80s with the East Thomas Eagles of the Birmingham Industrial League, which was a semi-professional league made up of iron and steel workers that was an integral form of entertainment in Birmingham in the 20th century. Jackson’s baseball journey took him to Rickwood Field many times. After all these years, he was just excited that it’s still standing. “It’s nice seeing them re-do all of this,” he said, “instead of tearing it down. We played in the same ballpark they named after Willie Mays out in Fairfield (Alabama). And then I had my times out here playing at this ballpark. It’s all very exciting.”",

There were photos and artifacts of baseball Hall of Famers who played at the 114-year-old ballpark, including Jackie Robinson, Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige. The original clubhouse of the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues, where Mays got his pro start in 1948, was open. A memorial of Mays was at the front, with bobbleheads, a signed glove and his Black Barons and San Francisco Giants jerseys on display. Outside, fans stood in line to hold a baseball bat used by Mays in 1959. They took photos sitting inside an original bus from 1947 that was typically used during barnstorming tours by Negro Leagues teams. They danced to live music and ate food from concession stands featuring menu boards designed to reflect the look and feel of the 1940s. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

                    "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — As Ajay Stone strolled around historic Rickwood Field and gazed at tributes displayed in honor of Willie Mays and other Negro Leaguers, he clutched a cherished memory under his arm. It was a picture from 2004 of Mays holding Stone’s then-10-month-old daughter Haley, who was wearing San Francisco Giants gear. In Mays’ hand was a chunk of a chocolate chip cookie, which he was handing over for Haley to eat. “Willie gave her that cookie. She had no teeth,” Stone remembered. “But we took the cookie and we kept it in her stroller for a year and a half. The great Willie Mays gave it to her, so it was special to us.” Stone and his wife Christina traveled from Charlotte, North Carolina, to be in Birmingham, Alabama, on Thursday for a moment they deemed just as special. It was hours before Rickwood Field hosted its first Major League Baseball game between the Giants and St. Louis Cardinals. The game, which MLB called “A Tribute to the Negro Leagues,” was meant to honor the legacy of Mays and other Black baseball greats who left an enduring mark on the sport. MLB planned a week of activities around Mays and the Negro Leagues, including an unveiling ceremony on Wednesday of a Willie Mays mural in downtown Birmingham. Those tributes took on a more significant meaning Tuesday afternoon when Mays died at 93. As news of his death spread throughout Birmingham, celebrations of his life ramped up.

They’re lifelong Giants fans who came from California for the game. “I never even got to see Willie Mays play, but as a Giants fan, you knew what he meant to the game of baseball,” Torres said. “My son, he’s only 11. Willie Mays had such an effect on the game that even he knew who Willie Mays was.” Musical artist Jon Batiste strummed a guitar while dancing on a wooden stage near home plate just before the first pitch. Fans stood as former Negro Leaguers were helped to the field for a pregame ceremony. Shouts of “Willie! Willie! broke out after a brief moment of silence. For Michael Jackson, sitting in the stands at Rickwood Field reminded him of the past. The 71-year-old Jackson played baseball in the 1970s and 80s with the East Thomas Eagles of the Birmingham Industrial League, which was a semi-professional league made up of iron and steel workers that was an integral form of entertainment in Birmingham in the 20th century. Jackson’s baseball journey took him to Rickwood Field many times. After all these years, he was just excited that it’s still standing. “It’s nice seeing them re-do all of this,” he said, “instead of tearing it down. We played in the same ballpark they named after Willie Mays out in Fairfield (Alabama). And then I had my times out here playing at this ballpark. It’s all very exciting.”",

On Sunday, the couple’s social media accounts shared another photo from the same May trip to Holkham Beach on the Norfolk seaside in honor of Father’s Day. Holkham is a half-hour drive away from Anmer Hall, William and Kate’s country home on the Sandringham Estate. The family has been spotted walking their dog there in the past, and the late Queen Elizabeth II would reportedly visit the beach using a private entrance on the property of the Thomas Coke, the eighth Earl of Leicester. Though Kate had a photography mishap earlier this year when a confusingly edited family photo went viral, the pair of photographs show that the princess is back behind the camera. Her birthday tribute to William even got a rave review from Millie Pilkington, one of the photographers who has taken official portraits of the family. “Such a heavenly portrait,” Pilkington said on Instagram, along with a few heart emoji. “Wonderful father and gorgeous children. Rather wonderful mother too.” On Saturday, Kate made her first official public appearance since Christmas when she attended Trooping the Colour, the London birthday parade in honor of King Charles III. When she announced that she would attend, she shared a statement where she discussed the progress she has made since her cancer diagnosis earlier this year, though she added that her treatment will continue for a few more months. “On the days I feel well enough, it is a joy to engage with school life, spend personal time on the things that give me energy and positivity, as well as starting to do a little work from home,” she said. “I’m looking forward to attending the King’s birthday parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer, but equally knowing I am not out of the woods yet.”",

                    "text": "Two-time Olympic gold medalist Lilly King was already having a week to remember. Then, an unexpected moment of joy happened on Thursday night. King, 27, already won the 100-meter breaststroke earlier in the week at the U.S. Olympic swimming trials in Indianapolis to qualify for the 2024 Paris Summer Games before finishing second behind Kate Douglass in the 200-meter 200 breaststroke on Thursday night to qualify for that race as well. But it’s what came after that race that really shocked the swimmer. Her boyfriend, James Wells, was caught on camera popping the question to get engaged. And the answer was a resounding yes. Wells, a former swimmer at the University of Indiana where they both attended, delivered a touching soliloquy as King looked on in astonishment after she admitted someone told her to put her hair down for the moment. “Just to see you grow has been so awesome and I don’t regret for a minute dropping my job and moving halfway across the country for us to move in together. It has been awesome and I am very excited to see where this is going, so, dear, I was wondering, Lillia Camille King, will you marry me?”‘ Wells asked. Wells got down on one knee as waited on bated breath for King’s answer, which was a yes, and the two shared a hug and a kiss all caught on the NBC cameras. Fellow swimmer Ryan Murphy didn’t see the moment but called it “unbelievable” once she heard about the news. “I didn’t see it,” Murphy said. “That’s unbelievable. I’d love to hear her reaction to how it is to get proposed to completely out of breath and soaked. That’s incredible. She must be riding an absolute high.” King, who’s claimed five total medals in her Olympic career, now will look to add more to her trophy case this summer after adding a ring to her hand.",

Moments after qualifying in the 200-meter breaststroke at Thursday's Olympic trials, the swimmer, 27, received a sweet proposal from her boyfriend, James Wells. NBC Sports shared a video of the moment, showing King overwhelmed with emotion as Wells declared his love for her. \"Getting to watch you over the last four years, both in and out of the pool, and just to see you grow has been so awesome,\" Wells said as King looked away and joked that she needs someone to fix her hair. \"I don't regret for a minute dropping my job and moving halfway across the country for us to move in together,\" Wells continued. \"It has been awesome, and I am very excited to see where this is going. So, dear, I was wondering, Lilly Camille King, will you marry me?\" King immediately said yes, kissed Wells and the two of them embraced. During an interview, King said she had no clue about the proposal. \"I was really confused 'cause Annie [Lazor] told me to put my hair down before I walked out instead of having it in my cap, and I was like, 'Ok, sounds good,' and then I was just confused because you were down here,\" she told NBC Sports. King will represent Team USA in the 200-meter breaststroke and compete in the 100-meter breaststroke. With these qualifications, King will become the first U.S. swimmer to swim both the 100 and 200-meter breaststroke at three consecutive Olympic Games, per Bleacher Report. The Indiana native has competed in two Olympic games, earning two gold medals, two silver medals and one bronze medal. Earlier this month, King announced that she is not aiming at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

King, who already qualified with her win in the women’s 100-meter breaststroke, was walking off the pool deck at Lucas Oil Stadium after qualifying for her second individual event when her boyfriend, former Indiana University swimmer James Wells, approached her. \"Getting to watch you over the last four years, both in and out of the pool, and just to see you grow has been so awesome,\" Wells said in a video shared by NBC Sports.

It has been awesome, and I am very excited to see where this goes. So, dear, I was wondering, Lilly Camille King, will you marry me?\" King, 27, said \"yes\" right away and the couple sealed their engagement with a kiss. FRENCH SWIMMER RAFAEL FENTE-DAMERS SUFFERS SHOULDER INJURY AS HE ACHIEVES OLYMPIC QUALIFICATION \"I didn’t see it\" Team USA’s Ryan Murphy said of King’s engagement. \"That’s unbelievable. I’d love to hear her reaction to how it is to get proposed to completely out of breath and soaked. That’s incredible. She must be riding an absolute high.\" King said in an interview after the proposal that she had been completely caught off guard, but former teammate Annie Lazor did suggest she put her hair down just moments before.

                    "text": "Thursday night ended up being life-changing for Olympic swimmer Lilly King. After qualifying for the Paris Olympics at the U.S. Olympic swimming trials, King also got engaged after her boyfriend, James Wells, proposed to her. King finished second to Kate Douglass in the 200-meter breaststroke event minutes prior. This came after King had already qualified for the Paris Olympics in the 100-meter breaststroke event earlier this week. When it comes to the U.S. swimming trials, a first-place finish guarantees the winner a spot in that specific Olympic event. A second-place finish doesn't guarantee a spot in that event, but it's very close to a lock that King will be competing in the 200-meter breaststroke in Paris. After exiting the pool, Wells was waiting for King. NBC cameras caught the proposal as the two talked, and Wells eventually popped the question that was met with a resounding \"yes\" from King. King earned gold medals in the 100-meter breaststroke and the 4x100-meter medley relay at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. She followed that up with two silver medals and a bronze medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Now King will be looking to secure a few more medals at the Paris Olympics, which begin next month.",

                    "text": "Peru and Chile eye a strong start to their Copa America journeys on Friday when they face each other in Arlington, Texas during the opening weekend of the tournament. Expectations are not particularly high for either side but after closing out 2023 in the bottom three in CONMEBOL's 10-team World Cup qualifying campaign, both teams are eyeing a redemption narrative of sorts. Their form has trended upward after both made managerial changes, but a faceoff against each other will set the tone for their prospects in the Copa America and also as a measuring stick for their progress in the new year. Here's what you need to know before tuning in. How to watch and odds Date: Friday, June 21 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: AT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasTV: Fox Sports 1 | Live stream: Fubo (try for free)Odds: Peru +330; Draw +210; Chile +100 Group A outlook Considering reigning continental and world champions Argentina are in this group, the other teams -- including Canada -- are most likely competing for second place. The trio are within 17 places of each other in the FIFA rankings, suggesting that there's a chance for each of them to find their way out of the group in closely-contested matchups. It means the stakes are high on the days they are not facing Argentina with three valuable points on the line, but goal differential even in the games they face Lionel Messi and company could prove crucial in determining who makes it to the quarterfinals. Storylines Peru: The Copa America comes with fond recent memories for Peru, who were runners-up in 2019 and were semifinalists two years later but recent results mean the team had to dig themselves out of a hole in 2024. They are currently bottom of the World Cup qualifying table with zero wins in six games, forcing them to replace manager Juan Reynoso with Jorge Fossati. He has steadied the ship so far -- Peru are undefeated in all four games they have played this year, outscoring the opposition seven to one as goalkeeper Pedro Gallese remains their standout star. Fossati's Peru is untested against higher profile opponents, though, and so the Copa America will serve as a testing ground of sorts. Chile: Chile are just eight years removed from becoming back-to-back Copa America champions, but the team have taken a downward slide as their golden generation nears retirement, most notably missing out on the last two World Cups. They now sit eighth in World Cup qualifying with just one win in six, forcing them to swap manager Eduardo Berizzo for Ricardo Gareca, who is getting the best out of the group so far. They have 3-0 wins against Albania and Paraguay in their record in 2024, as well as a 3-2 loss to France in which Marcelino Nunez and Darío Osorio scored. Their recent form teases that Chile might be able to do some damage at the Copa America, but it is still early days in Gareca's tenure. Prediction Chile's upward trajectory under Gareca, even if he has just three games under his belt, seems convincing enough that they might be the better team in their Copa America opener against Peru. Considering Chile have goals in them, expect them to tally a few on Friday and open the tournament on a winning note. Pick: Peru 0, Chile 2",

Portugal's 2-1 victory over the Czech Republic was not quite the same thrill a minute encounter, a familiar game for Cristiano Ronaldo and company where they looked to be less than the sum of their impressive parts even in victory. If that does not change it is hard to see how they rank among the foremost favorites to win it all in the weeks ahead. Here is how you can watch the match and what you need to know: Viewing information Date: Saturday, June 22 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: Westfalenstadion -- Dortmund, GermanyTV: Fox | Live stream: Fubo (try for free)Odds: Turkiye+480; Draw +300; Portugal -167 Group F outlook and permutations Both Turkiye and Portugal go into this game with similar permutations dictating their path to the last 16. The winner of this game will reach the knockout round as Group F leaders if there is either a draw between Georgia and Czech Republic or the team they beat in the first round of fixtures wins. Turkiye, then, need to win and hope the Czechs do not beat Georgia. For Portugal three points of their own and any for Georgia take them through as Group F winners. Team news Turkiye: Don't expect much changing of a winning team from Vincenzo Montella, key man Hakan Calhanoglu would miss the game with the Czech Republic if he receives a booking but Turkiye's priority will be getting the point or points that would have them set fair to make the knockout rounds. Possible Turkiye XI: Gunok; Muldur, Akaydin, Bardakci, Kadioglu; Ayhan, Calhanoglu, Kokcu; Guler, Yildiz; Yilmaz Portugal: Their opening win brought with it familiar questions over whether Cristiano Ronaldo gets the best out of the players around him, who often seem more focused on feeding their captain than building possession play of their own. Regardless the leading scorer in men's international football is unlikely to make way from Roberto Martinez's XI. Rafael Leao might. Possible Portugal XI: Costa; Cancelo, Dias, Pepe, Mendes; Palhinha, Vitinha, Fernandes; Silva, Ronaldo, Felix Prediction Turkiye might just be feisty and aggressive enough to get something in front of what could well be a crowd filled with their supporters from Dortmund and beyond.

                    "text": "Belgium and Romania meet in Cologne on Saturday as UEFA Euro 2024's Group E completes its second round of games. The Belgians suffered a shock 1-0 loss to Slovakia in their opening fixture so cannot afford to not win this while the Romanians thumped Ukraine and could reach the round of 16 with a win. Domenico Tedesco's men were expected to finish top of the pile in this group but suddenly face an uphill task after a VAR-impacted defeat last time out for a first Red Devils loss under the Italy-born German tactician. That is the end of a 15-game unbeaten streak which leaves Belgium third in Group E and top spot could already be beyond them before kick-off if Slovakia beat Ukraine. Euro 2000 was the last time that the Belgians lost more than one game in the same tournament campaign and 1930 was the last time that they lost both of their two first games in any international competition. This contrasts with Romania who are suddenly brimming with confidence after thumping Ukraine with Edward Iordanescu's men getting their biggest ever Euro win in that game. Victory in Cologne would send the Tricolors into the round of 16 and possibly in top spot while only one of their 16 games across all competitions has finished in defeat. They also have three consecutive clean sheets ahead of this game and beat Belgium the last time these two met back in a 2012 friendly. Here's our storylines, how you can watch the match and more: How to watch and odds Date: Saturday, June 22 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Cologne Stadium - Cologne, GermanyWatch: FOX or Fubo (try for free)Odds: Belgium -225; Draw +340; Romania +650 Group E This one is finely poised with Romania and Slovakia in the strongest positions but a balanced group with all four on three points possible if Belgium and Ukraine win these games. Should that happen, Group E could look totally different ahead of the final round of games. Alternatively, it could all be decided now if Romania and Slovakia win their games and book the round of 16 berths with a game to spare. Team news Belgium: Thomas Meunier missed out against Slovakia while Axel Witsel and Jan Vertonghen were also not fit enough to feature. Vertonghen is fit and could come in for Yannick Carrasco but Witsel's availability is uncertain and Meunier is not expected back before the Ukraine game. Orel Mangala, Dodi Lukebakio and Youri Tielemans are on bookings while Johan Bakayoko will hope to start over Jeremy Doku or Leandro Trossard. Possible Belgium XI: Casteels; Castagne, Debast, Faes, Theate; Tielemans, Onana; Doku, De Bruyne, Trossard; Lukaku. Romania: Razvan Marin is one booking away from suspension while Valentin Mihaila could come in to replace Florinel Coman on the left. Mihaila missed out against Ukraine through illness but came on for 30 minutes and was a key figure in qualification with three of his four goals national team goals in that campaign. Possible Romania XI: Nita; Ratiu, Dragusin, Burca, Bancu; R. Marin, M. Marin, Stanciu; Man, Dragus, Mihaila. Prediction Belgium cannot afford to not win this so expect them to narrowly edge past Romania who know that a draw would be a good result and possibly enough to take them through.

                    "text": "In spite of all the complexities that could emerge in the next few days as six sides vie for four bonus spots in the Euro 2024 knockout rounds, the equation for Scotland and Hungary is simple. Win or you're going home. The former got their first point of the contest with a battling 1-1 draw against Switzerland in the second round of games, placing them ahead of a Hungarian side who have lost by two goal margins to both the Swiss and leaders Germany. Bidding to reach the knockout round for the second time in the last three Euros, Hungary not only need to win but win well given that they have lost both of their games by a two goal margin so far. In the two tournaments with 24 sides, no team who got four points from the group stage have failed to reach the knockout rounds. A win should be enough for Scotland. Here is how you can watch the match and what you need to know: Viewing information Date: Sunday, June 22 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Stuttgart Arena -- Stuttgart, GermanyTV: Fox Sports 1 | Live stream: Fubo (try for free)Odds: Scotland +160; Draw +290; Hungary +145 Group A outlook In all likelihood Germany and Switzerland have the top two wrapped up; it would take a heavy defeat for the latter to start the major swing in goal difference that Scotland need to reach second place. Team news Scotland: With Ryan Porteous still suspended for the red card he got in the 5-1 loss to Germany, the last thing Scotland needed was to have their defensive numbers hit further. That is just what happened on Monday night with Kieran Tierney suffering a serious hamstring injury that will sideline him not just for the remainder of the Euros but the start of next season. The Arsenal man is a vital player for his national team, arguably the reason why Steve Clarke plays a back three due to his interplay with Andrew Robertson. Scott McKenna is expected to take his place as he did off the bench against Switzerland but Tierney's absence will be keenly felt. Possible Scotland XI: Gunn; Hendry, Hanley, McKenna; Ralston, McGregor, Gilmour, Robertson; McTominay, McGinn; Adams Hungary: A curious dilemma ahead for Marco Rossi, whose side might arguably need freshening up given their last two results but who were altogether more competitive in defeat to the Germans than they had been against the Swiss. Given that there are no known fitness issues, Hungary might just run it back one more time. Possible Hungary XI: Gulacsi; Fiola, Orban, Dardai; Bolla, A. Nagy, Schafer, Kerkez; Sallai, Szoboszlai, B. Varga Prediction Scotland's injury issues in defense might just be too much for Clarke to adjust to but a narrow win would leave Hungary sweating in the days to come. PICK: Scotland 1, Hungary 2",

Now Group B joins the party with Mexico and Jamaica set to square off at NRG Stadium in Houston, TX on Saturday. The Concacaf rivals will meet for the 29th time and El Tri leads the all-time series (20W-5D-3L) against the Reggae Boyz. The two sides faced each other last summer during the 2023 Concacaf Gold Cup, where Mexico defeated Jamaica 3-0. Here's everything you need to know about the upcoming match: Viewing information Date: Saturday, June 22Time: 9 p.m.Place: NRG Stadium -- Houston, TXTV: Fox Sports 1, TUDN, UnivisionStream: Fox Sports Storylines Mexico: Head coach Jimmy Lozano is leaning into the next generation of players for El Tri during Copa America. Memo Ochoa, Raul Jimenez, and Chucky Lozano were each purposeful omissions from the roster, and the manager has been vocal about utilizing the tournament as crucial prep ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Mexico is considered a favorite of Group B, but it's a collection of teams where anyone could be considered a front-runner. It's likely that 26-year-old Edson Alverez, Mexico's most-capped player this tournament, will help anchor the midfield. The West Ham player will try to open things up with 23-year-old Feyenoord forward Santiago Giménez, on the attacking line. Jamaica: The Reggae Boyz are managing extensive off-field issues with their federation as they return for their third attempt at Copa America. This is the first time in eight years that they'll face squads that aren't Concacaf teams, and some rostered players are dealing with injuries, while Leon Blake has been open about his mistreatment by the federation and has flat-out stated he will not play for the national team till issues are resolved. Still, manager Heimir Hallgrimsson has implemented a style of play for team identity. One that is heavily reliant on defensive organization, and absorbs pressure before striking on quick counters. If healthy, Philadelphia Union's Andre Blake will handle duties in goal, with defender Damion Lowe and midfielders Kasey Palmer and Bobby Decordova-Reid help maintain Jamaica's structure.

                    "text": "That demand continues to push prices higher. The median price of an existing home sold in May was $419,300, a record-high price in the Realtors' recording and up 5.8% year over year. The gain was the strongest since October 2022. Prices gained in all regions. The Realtors noted in a release that the mortgage payment for a typical home today is more than double what it was five years ago. Not only have rates climbed, but home prices are more than 50% higher than they were five years ago. That comes in part because the median is skewing to the higher end. Sales of homes priced below $250,000 were lower than a year ago, while sales priced between $250,000 and $500,000 were up just 1%. Sales priced between $750,000 and $1 million were 13% higher, and sales priced over $1 million were up nearly 23%. Cash is still king, accounting for 28% of sales. First-time buyers are hanging in at 31% of sales, up from 28% the year before. Two-thirds of homes went under contract in less than a month, so competition is still strong despite higher prices. Redfin, a real estate brokerage, is reporting that an increasing number of listings are becoming stale, so if a home comes on the market that is well-priced and doesn't need much work, it goes fast.

                    "text": "Sales of previously occupied US homes fell in May for the third straight month as rising mortgage rates and record-high prices discouraged many prospective homebuyers during what’s traditionally the housing market’s busiest period of the year. Sales of previously occupied US homes fell 0.7% in May from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.11 million, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. Existing home sales also fell 2.8% compared with May last year. The latest sales still came in slightly higher than the 4.07 million pace economists were expecting, according to FactSet. “I thought that we would actually see a recovery this spring —- we are not seeing it,” said Lawrence Yun, the NAR’s chief economist. Despite the pullback in sales, home prices climbed compared with a year earlier for the 11th month in a row. The national median sales price rose 5.8% from a year earlier to $419,300, an all-time high on records going back to 1999. It’s also up 51% from five years ago. Home prices rose even as sales slowed and the supply of properties on the market hit its highest level in 4 years. The US housing market has been mired in a slump going back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Existing home sales sank to a nearly 30-year low last year as the average rate on a 30-year mortgage surged to a 23-year high of 7.79%, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has mostly hovered around 7% this year as stronger-than-expected reports on the economy and inflation have forced the Federal Reserve to keep its short-term rate at the highest level in more than 20 years. Federal Reserve officials said last week that inflation has fallen further toward their target level of 2% in recent months and signaled that they expect to cut their benchmark interest rate once this year. The central bank had previously projected as many as three cuts in 2024. The elevated mortgage rates are keeping many homeowners who bought or refinanced more than two years ago from selling now because they don’t want to give up their fixed-rate mortgages below 3% or 4% — a trend real estate experts refer to as the “lock-in” effect. As of the end of last year, more than 50% of homes with a mortgage had a rate that was 4% or lower, and 87% had a rate at 6% or lower, according to Realtor.com. Another factor that’s constrained the housing market is a tight supply of homes for sale, though that’s been easing this year, partly because homes are taking longer to sell. All told, there were about 1.3 million unsold homes at the end of last month, an increase of 6.7% from April and up 18.5% from May last year, NAR said. That translates to a 3.7-month supply at the current sales pace. In a more balanced market between buyers and sellers there is a 4- to 5-month supply. “Let’s wait to see if this leads to more home sales,” Yun said. “So far, that’s not the case, but at least the inventory is beginning to loosen up.”",

Homebuyers snapped up homes last month typically within just 24 days after the properties hit the market. And 30% of those properties sold for more than their original list price, which typically means sellers received offers from multiple home shoppers. First-time homebuyers who don’t have any home equity to put toward their down payment continue to have a tough time getting into the housing market. They accounted for 31% of all homes sold last month, which is down from 33% in April, but up from 28% in May last year. They’ve accounted for 40% of sales historically. Homebuyers who can afford to sidestep mortgage rates and pay all cash for a home accounted for 28% of sales last month, up from 25% in May last year. And about 16% of homes sold in May were bought by individual investors or homeowners looking to buy a second home, up from 15% a year earlier, the NAR said. « Previous Next",

                    "text": "LOS ANGELES — Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in May for the third straight month as rising mortgage rates and record-high prices discouraged many prospective homebuyers during what’s traditionally the housing market’s busiest period of the year. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell 0.7% in May from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.11 million, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. Existing home sales also fell 2.8% compared with May last year. The latest sales still came in slightly higher than the 4.07 million pace economists were expecting, according to FactSet. “I thought that we would actually see a recovery this spring — we are not seeing it,” said Lawrence Yun, the NAR’s chief economist. Despite the pullback in sales, home prices climbed compared with a year earlier for the 11th month in a row. The national median sales price rose 5.8% from a year earlier to $419,300, an all-time high on records going back to 1999. It’s also up 51% from five years ago. Home prices rose even as sales slowed and the supply of properties on the market hit its highest level in 4 years. The U.S. housing market has been mired in a slump going back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Existing home sales sank to a nearly 30-year low last year as the average rate on a 30-year mortgage surged to a 23-year high of 7.79%, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has mostly hovered around 7% this year as stronger-than-expected reports on the economy and inflation have forced the Federal Reserve to keep its short-term rate at the highest level in more than 20 years. Federal Reserve officials said last week that inflation has fallen further toward their target level of 2% in recent months and signaled that they expect to cut their benchmark interest rate once this year. The central bank had previously projected as many as three cuts in 2024. The elevated mortgage rates are keeping many homeowners who bought or refinanced more than two years ago from selling now because they don’t want to give up their fixed-rate mortgages below 3% or 4% - a trend real estate experts refer to as the “lock-in” effect. As of the end of last year, more than 50% of homes with a mortgage had a rate that was 4% or lower, and 87% had a rate at 6% or lower, according to Realtor.com. Another factor that’s constrained the housing market is a tight supply of homes for sale, though that’s been easing this year, partly because homes are taking longer to sell. All told, there were about 1.3 million unsold homes at the end of last month, an increase of 6.7% from April and up 18.5% from May last year, NAR said. That translates to a 3.7-month supply at the current sales pace. In a more balanced market between buyers and sellers there is a 4- to 5-month supply. “Let’s wait to see if this leads to more home sales,” Yun said. “So far, that’s not the case, but at least the inventory is beginning to loosen up.”",

Aside from T-Mobile and HughesNet (our picks listed above for best rural internet and best satellite internet), here are some of the rural internet options you may encounter in Nebraska. Kinetic: DSL internet like that of Windstream’s Kinetic run service using telephone lines, which are much more readily available in rural areas than cable or fiber connections. Kinetic internet starts at just $40 a month for speeds up to 100Mbps, although most locations will see slower speeds. Nextlink:A close second to T-Mobile in terms of wireless coverage in Nebraska, NextLink is available to many households in the eastern half of the state. Available speeds and pricing vary by location, but it’s possible to get speeds of 500 to 2,000Mbps starting at $30 to $100 a month. Rise Broadband: Another wireless provider, Rise Broadband is available to around a quarter of Nebraska households, primarily in the southern and eastern parts of the state. Maximum speeds aren’t quite as fast as T-Mobile or NextLink, but the starting price isn’t bad at $55 a month and unlimited data is included. Starlink: A fleet of low-orbiting satellites gives Starlink a speed and latency advantage over Hughesnet and Viasat, although the pricing is still sky-high. Expect an equipment cost of $499 to get started and an ongoing monthly rate of $120. Viasat: Like Hughesnet, Viasat is available throughout all of Nebraska. Pricing is a bit higher, but you may be able to get faster speeds and a higher data allowance with the added cost.",

Certain providers only service particular regions of the state. You'll find Sparklight and Frontier in the east, Xfinity around Tucson, and Cox in the south. Desirable fiber connections are limited, leaving many residents with DSL, cable or fixed wireless options. Our picks for the best ISPs are largely based on availability since even the fastest residential providers typically top out at 940 megabits per second in the Grand Canyon State. Limited fiber availability means your best options might be Cox Communications, Optimum, Xfinity, or 5G home internet from Verizon or T-Mobile. Rural homes outside of wired internet reach will likely be looking at a local fixed wireless provider or satellite internet to get online. Source: CNET analysis of provider data. Regarding wired internet for rural Arizona, your best bet will likely be an older network, like CenturyLink’s DSL service, our choice for the top rural ISP in the nation. It has a much broader reach than the company’s fiber offering but can still get you speeds up to 100Mbps in some places. With plans running $55 a month, this is a good place to start in your search for rural internet. If that doesn’t work out, consider fixed wireless or satellite as an alternative. Arizona is full of small fixed wireless ISPs, some of which we’ve included in the chart above. Plug your address into the Federal Communications Commission National Broadband Map to see which ones service your area. Fixed wireless can sometimes be slow and expensive, but it’s better than no connection at all, and it may work out to be a better deal than satellite. Fixed wireless speeds can vary with location and distance. You need a clear line of sight to a tower. Plans vary quite a bit from provider to provider, with some starting at 10Mbps speeds, which doesn’t even qualify as broadband in the eyes of the FCC. Others offer speeds as high as 150Mbps in some areas, but the monthly price can increase to well over $100. Some small providers are working to bring faster internet to underserved areas. AireBeam, for example, has been expanding its fiber network in Florence and Casa Grande and is introducing speeds up to 2,000Mbps in some areas. Its fixed wireless service reaches rural parts of Pinal, Maricopa and Pima counties. If both DSL and fixed wireless fail you, consider satellite internet from Starlink, Viasat or Hughesnet. You just need a clear view of the southern sky for it to work. Satellite equipment costs and monthly fees can be expensive and speeds aren’t always great, so start by considering DSL or fixed wireless options before you turn to satellite.",

One of the top unrestricted free agents on the market, Monk was viewed as the exact type of bucket getter who could end up commanding big money. As it turns out, Monk isn’t going anywhere. According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, the Sacramento Kings took advantage of the exclusive negotiating window teams have with their own free agents to give Monk a 4-year deal worth $78 million, which he intends to sign. Monk is coming off of the most productive season of his career as a member of the Kings, one which saw him finish as the runner-up for the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year award. He averaged 15.4 points and 5.1 assists per game, both of which were the highest marks of his career, and was an important part of head coach Mike Brown’s rotation despite coming off the bench in every game he played this season. After spending the first four years of his career as a member of the Charlotte Hornets and making a pit stop in Los Angeles as a member of the Lakers, Monk joined the Kings on a 2-year deal last offseason, where he was reunited with one of his teammates in college at the University of Kentucky, De’Aaron Fox. Now, he’s getting the chance to cash in on how his stint in Sacramento has gone up to this point.",

On Thursday night, Malik Monk agreed to a four-year deal worth $78 million, including a player option, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski. The Kings, who failed to advance out of the play-in round, were hoping the guard would return during free agency after he recorded a career-best 15.4 points and 5.1 assists per game in 2023-24. They got their wish. Monk, 26, was the league’s Sixth Man of the Year runner-up after his strong campaign. Monk could have started hearing from other teams on June 30 when free agency officially opens up for players to openly and legally communicate with teams on the open market. On Wednesday, the Kings’ De’Aaron Fox spoke to reporters and said he had not talked to Monk about his free-agent decision since the season ended. “I don’t really ask him about it. … I’m not sure,” Fox told ABC10. “We’re friends first. …I’m not really asking him anything about free agency.” “Him being able to be in this situation and obviously having multiple teams that are trying to come after him, I’m definitely happy for him,” Fox added. “Obviously, we want him to stay but, at the end of the day, he has to do what’s best for him.” The upcoming season will be Monk’s third in Sacramento. Monk spent four years in Charlotte after he was drafted by the Hornets in the first round (11th pick) of the 2017 NBA Draft, followed by a one-season stint with the Lakers before going to the Kings.",

Monk, the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year runner-up, had a career-best season, averaging over 15 points and five assists, and he avoids free agency with the maximum deal available to him to stay in Sacramento. His agents, Jeff Schwartz and Marcus Monk of Excel Sports, were able to begin negotiations Tuesday with Kings general manager Monte McNair and assistant GM Wes Wilcox, and Monk intends to sign the new deal once the league's moratorium ends July 6, sources said. Keeping Monk allows the organization to continue building out the roster with confidence now that he has been retained. Monk, 26, has resurrected his career with the Kings and keeping him became a major offseason priority. Monk led the NBA in points and assists off the bench last season and became one of only two players in the past 25 years to have 1,000 points and 300 assists as a reserve, according to ESPN Stats & Information. Monk helped bring the Kings back to the playoffs and play-in in consecutive seasons, ending a 16-year postseason drought. A knee injury cost him the final nine games of the 2023-24 regular season and the play-in tournament. Monk had nine 25-point games off the bench for the Kings, the most since Eddie Johnson did it for the Kings in the 1986-87 season, according to ESPN Stats & Information. Monk was the 11th pick to Charlotte in the 2017 NBA draft, spending four seasons with the Hornets before signing a free agent deal with the Los Angeles Lakers for one season in 2021.",

This was the max contract the Kings could offer Monk with his early Bird rights. It is a big deal that Monk signed before even testing free agency, as he could've been offered $100 million by other teams and it's likely someone would've gone higher than Sacramento. Orlando would've made sense from a scoring need and financial standpoint. Here's how Monk's contract breaks down annually. Monk, who finished as the Sixth Man of the Year runner-up to Naz Reid after averaging a career high 15.4 points and 5.1 assists this season, is an electric scorer for the Kings and has clearly found a home he was not interested in leaving even with more money likely available. It's been quite the rise for Monk over the last two years in Sacramento after he was only able to command the veteran's minimum salary with the Lakers the summer of 2021. He played well for the Lakers, and has broken out with the Kings. Last season, Monk led all bench players in total points and assists and was one of only two players in the past 25 years to have 1,000 points and 300 assists as a reserve, according to ESPN Stats. He also carded the highest assist percentage on drives among all players. He punctures defenses in multiple ways, even as a high-flying lob finisher from the guard position. For the Kings, this checks off their biggest internal box and allows them to focus on free agency and the draft (they have the No. 13 pick) knowing that Monk is on board on a pretty team-friendly deal. Monk can officially sign the contract with Sacramento on July 6.",

                    "text": "By LARRY NEUMEISTER (Associated Press) NEW YORK (AP) — Prosecutors showed jurors at Sen. Bob Menendez ’s trial on Thursday multiple instances when he researched the value of gold as he tried to help a New Jersey businessman who authorities say bribed him with gold and cash. The evidence about the Democrat’s online searches was prominently displayed to a New York jury as prosecutors traced the history of his text messages and internet queries as he allegedly tried to aid Fred Dabies, a prominent New Jersey real estate developer who is on trial with him. The evidence is considered crucial in the government’s effort to prove that Menendez and his wife received gold bars, cash and a luxury car from 2018 to 2022 from three New Jersey businessmen who benefited from favors Menendez allegedly delivered in return. Menendez, Dabies and another businessman and codefendant, Wael Hana, have pleaded not guilty. His wife, Nadine Menendez, faces trial at a later date after she recovers from breast cancer surgery. She too has pleaded not guilty. A third businessman pleaded guilty prior to trial and testified against the other defendants before the trial entered its sixth week in Manhattan federal court. The gold bars found in the home Menendez shared with his wife in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, took a prominent role early in the trial when an FBI agent described a 2022 search of the residence the senator moved into after the couple was married in 2020, two years after they began dating. The search found gold bars worth more than $100,000 and over $486,000 in cash, some stuffed in the pockets of coats hanging in closets or in shoes and boots. A Mercedes-Benz that prosecutors say was a bribe was parked in the garage. On Thursday, the topic of gold came up repeatedly as another FBI agent described internet searches Menendez conducted when he researched the price of gold in April 2019, twice in May 2021, again in October 2021, twice in December 2021, once in January 2022 and again in March and May 2022. Among the searches, Agent Paul Van Wie said, were instances when Menendez researched the worth of a gram, an ounce and a kilo of gold. The agent said a search of Menendez’s internet history since 2008 showed that the senator had never searched for gold prices during that span until April 5, 2019. Defense lawyers have said gold bars found in the home belonged to Nadine Menendez and that she kept the senator in the dark about gifts she accepted when she was strapped for cash. Prosecutors sought to prove Thursday through emails, text messages and the online searches for the price of gold that Menendez was interested in gold as he allegedly sought to recommend a new federal prosecutor for New Jersey who could help Dabies get a favorable outcome to a criminal case against him. The online searches also occurred as Menendez allegedly used his international clout to help Dabies secure a $95 million investment from a Qatari investment fund by taking actions favorable to Qatar’s government. Daibes has been credited with the construction of a string of luxury waterfront buildings, known as the “gold coast,” in the New Jersey town of Edgewater. Prosecutors showed the jury email and text correspondence Thursday reflecting that Menendez introduced Daibes to a member of Qatar’s royal family who was a principal in the investment firm and also met with Qatari officials and made public statements supportive of Qatar as the real estate deal was being negotiated. After the deal was signed in May 2022, prosecutors say, Daibes gave Menendez at least one gold bar. In the 2022 search of the Menendez home, FBI agents found two 1-kilogram gold bars and nine 1-ounce gold bars with serial numbers showing they had previously been possessed by Daibes, along with about 10 envelopes of cash with tens of thousands of dollars bearing the fingerprints or DNA of Daibes, according to the evidence shown to jurors. In August 2021, evidence shown to the jury Thursday showed, Menendez used an encrypted messaging application to send Daibes the text of a press release in which he praised the government of Qatar, before texting Daibes: “You might want to send to them. I am just about to release.” When Menendez was charged last fall, he held the powerful post of chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a position he relinquished after he was charged.

                    "text": "NEW YORK — Prosecutors showed jurors at Sen. Bob Menendez ’s trial on Thursday multiple instances when he researched the value of gold as he tried to help a New Jersey businessman who authorities say bribed him with gold and cash. The evidence about the Democrat’s online searches was prominently displayed to a New York jury as prosecutors traced the history of his text messages and internet queries as he allegedly tried to aid Fred Dabies, a prominent New Jersey real estate developer who is on trial with him. The evidence is considered crucial in the government’s effort to prove that Menendez and his wife received gold bars, cash and a luxury car from 2018 to 2022 from three New Jersey businessmen who benefited from favors Menendez allegedly delivered in return. Menendez, Dabies and another businessman and codefendant, Wael Hana, have pleaded not guilty. His wife, Nadine Menendez, faces trial at a later date after she recovers from breast cancer surgery. She too has pleaded not guilty. A third businessman pleaded guilty prior to trial and testified against the other defendants before the trial entered its sixth week in Manhattan federal court. The gold bars found in the home Menendez shared with his wife in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, took a prominent role early in the trial when an FBI agent described a 2022 search of the residence the senator moved into after the couple was married in 2020, two years after they began dating. The search found gold bars worth more than $100,000 and over $486,000 in cash, some stuffed in the pockets of coats hanging in closets or in shoes and boots. A Mercedes-Benz that prosecutors say was a bribe was parked in the garage. On Thursday, the topic of gold came up repeatedly as another FBI agent described internet searches Menendez conducted when he researched the price of gold in April 2019, twice in May 2021, again in October 2021, twice in December 2021, once in January 2022 and again in March and May 2022. Among the searches, Agent Paul Van Wie said, were instances when Menendez researched the worth of a gram, an ounce and a kilo of gold. The agent said a search of Menendez’s internet history since 2008 showed that the senator had never searched for gold prices during that span until April 5, 2019. Defense lawyers have said gold bars found in the home belonged to Nadine Menendez and that she kept the senator in the dark about gifts she accepted when she was strapped for cash. Prosecutors sought to prove Thursday through emails, text messages and the online searches for the price of gold that Menendez was interested in gold as he allegedly sought to recommend a new federal prosecutor for New Jersey who could help Dabies get a favorable outcome to a criminal case against him. The online searches also occurred as Menendez allegedly used his international clout to help Dabies secure a $95 million investment from a Qatari investment fund by taking actions favorable to Qatar’s government. Daibes has been credited with the construction of a string of luxury waterfront buildings, known as the “gold coast,” in the New Jersey town of Edgewater. Prosecutors showed the jury email and text correspondence Thursday reflecting that Menendez introduced Daibes to a member of Qatar’s royal family who was a principal in the investment firm and also met with Qatari officials and made public statements supportive of Qatar as the real estate deal was being negotiated. After the deal was signed in May 2022, prosecutors say, Daibes gave Menendez at least one gold bar. In the 2022 search of the Menendez home, FBI agents found two 1-kilogram gold bars and nine 1-ounce gold bars with serial numbers showing they had previously been possessed by Daibes, along with about 10 envelopes of cash with tens of thousands of dollars bearing the fingerprints or DNA of Daibes, according to the evidence shown to jurors. In August 2021, evidence shown to the jury Thursday showed, Menendez used an encrypted messaging application to send Daibes the text of a press release in which he praised the government of Qatar, before texting Daibes: “You might want to send to them. I am just about to release.” When Menendez was charged last fall, he held the powerful post of chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a position he relinquished after he was charged. He has resisted calls, including from prominent Democrats, that he resign from the Senate.",

One of the one-kilogram gold bars was found inside a Ziploc bag that had been wrapped in a paper towel, an FBI agent testified at the beginning of the trial. In the same closet, the FBI discovered a safe containing loose cash, envelopes of cash, seven one-ounce gold bars and another one-kilogram gold bar, the agent said.

                    "text": "Conor McGregor’s injury has been revealed as a broken toe that he sustained during a training session just before the fight. “We had a lapse in concentration and engaged in a training session without wearing the full protective gear and I hit the toe off the elbow and broke the toe clean,” McGregor said in an Instagram post on Friday. “It needs a few weeks that’s it. “The fans deserve it and we are getting close. A slight lapse in concentration and a nuisance of an injury was picked up. That’s it. Take the lesson and move forward. I will get this back… I’ve got two fights left on my contract.” There was baseless speculation that McGregor was in rehab due to partying habits, but his public relations manager told The Post that this was not the case. “Mr McGregor is with his family — and any other reports are incorrect,” said Karen Kessler, McGregor’s public relations manager. “He is looking forward to a rescheduled date for his next fight.“ The Post previously reported that McGregor would be ready by August or September, although the promotion will likely have to build up an entirely new fight card in order for that to happen. UFC 305 is currently scheduled for Perth, Australia while UFC 306 is at The Sphere in Las Vegas.

                    "text": "UFC International Fight Week took a major blow after Conor McGregor vs. Michael Chandler was scrapped as the main event of UFC 303. McGregor, eight days before what should have been his long-awaited return, revealed the injury that forced him off the card. McGregor, 35, has not competed since breaking his tibia in a doctor stoppage loss to Dustin Poirier three years ago. McGregor suffered another leg injury ahead of the Chandler fight but squashed speculation that it's related to his previous injury. \"We were so f---ing super ready for this fight it is absolutely gut-wrenching to take,\" McGregor wrote on Instagram. \"... We had a lapse in concentration and engaged in a training session without wearing the full protective gear and I hit the toe off the elbow and broke the toe clean.\" McGregor posted three photos on Twitter, including an X-ray, showing a broken pinkie toe on his left foot. The former two-division UFC champion posted the images to refute Chael Sonnen's claims on ESPN's \"Good Guy / Bad Guy\" that McGregor was in rehab for substance use. McGregor said he only requires a few weeks to heal from the injury but couldn't justify competing at less than 100%. McGregor also revealed he has two fights left on his UFC contract and would fight soon whether or not it's against Chandler. \"The fans deserve it and we are getting close,\" McGregor said. \"A slight lapse in concentration and a nuisance of an injury was picked up. That's it. Take the lesson and move forward. I will get this back. I've got to. I've got two fights left on my contract. \"...I'll be back. See ya's soon. See ya at the top. Chandler or not,\" he added. UFC scrambled to bolster UFC 303 following the cancellation of McGregor vs. Chandler. A short-notice UFC light heavyweight title rematch between Alex Pereira and Jiri Prochazka headlines the June 29 card with Brian Ortega vs. Diego Lopes added as the co-main event.",

                    "text": "A broken toe is what prevented Conor McGregor from fighting Michael Chandler next week in Las Vegas, the UFC star revealed Friday. McGregor (22-6) was due to face Chandler (23-8) at UFC 303 on June 29, but UFC CEO Dana White announced earlier this month that the fight was off. The nature of McGregor's injury was not known until Friday, when McGregor posted about it for the first time since the fight cancellation. \"Man we were so f---ing super ready for this fight it is absolutely gut wrenching to take,\" McGregor posted on Instagram. \"... We had a lapse in concentration and engaged in a training session without wearing the full protective gear and I hit the toe off the elbow and broke the toe clean. It needs a few weeks that's it. I couldn't just justify to my team, or fans, that I make the walk hindered again.\" UFC has since booked a light heavyweight title fight between Alex Pereira and JiYí Procházka to headline UFC 303. The promotion has not announced a time frame for rebooking McGregor. McGregor, 35, has not fought since he suffered a broken leg in a TKO loss to Dustin Poirier in July 2021. His withdrawal from UFC 303 marked the first time in his storied career that he has been forced to pull out of a fight for any reason. Chandler has not indicated whether he will wait for McGregor or book a new opponent. Chandler, 38, has not fought since November 2022, in large part due to waiting for McGregor. The two coached against each other on \"The Ultimate Fighter\" reality series in 2023. McGregor also posted on social media Friday that he is the biggest possible fight for Chandler, writing that \"he would need to fight 10 fights to make what he would make in this one.\" Chandler is getting paid 10x of what his contract states for other fights. Meaning he would need to fight 10 fights to make what he would make in this one. I'm The One.— Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) June 21, 2024 For those saying he could have fought 2 or 3 times by now etc. He'd need 10 to break even with this cheque.— Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) June 21, 2024 McGregor has now made multiple posts, including Friday's on Instagram, promising an eventual comeback. \"I will get this back,\" McGregor wrote. \"I've got [to]. I've got two fights left on my contract. I've got Bugattis and more yachts on my mind. I'm coming to shine. I gotta just take my time ... See ya's soon. See ya at the top. Chandler or not.\"",

                    "text": "NEW YORK — Donald Trump’s campaign outraised President Joe Biden by more than $60 million last month, according to federal filings made public Thursday that detailed the Republican fundraising explosion sparked by Trump’s felony convictions. Biden’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee together raised a robust $85 million in May and reported $212 million in the bank at the end of the month. The strong showing does not include roughly $40 million raised by Biden and his top surrogates in recent days - or a separate $20 million donation from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to pro-Biden groups. Still, Trump’s fundraising for, for one month at least, seemed to dwarf Biden’s. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee said it raised a jaw-dropping $141 million in May, including tens of millions donated immediately after Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in the New York hush money case. At the same time, billionaire Timothy Mellon, donated a stunning $50 million to a pro-Trump super PAC the day after Trump’s guilty verdict, according to filings made public Thursday. Trump’s campaign declined to report how much money it had in the bank at the end of May, prompting Biden’s campaign to question whether the groups were still spending heavily to cover Trump’s legal fees. “Our strong and consistent fundraising program grew by millions of people in May, a clear sign of strong and growing enthusiasm for the president and vice president every single month,” said Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez. “The money we continue to raise matters, and it’s helping the campaign build out an operation that invests in reaching and winning the voters who will decide this election –- a stark contrast to Trump’s PR stunts and photo-ops that he’s pretending is a campaign. Taken together, the numbers detailed in the campaigns’ latest Federal Election Commission filings suggest that Democrats may still maintain a cash advantage in the 2024 presidential contest. But almost four months before Election Day, Trump’s side is closing the gap - if it isn’t closed already. The new fundraising figures also underscore the extent to which the rules of presidential politics are being re-written in the Trump era. At almost any other time in U.S. history, a presidential candidate would have been forced to leave an election after being convicted of dozens of felonies. But in 2024, Trump’s guilty verdict has instead fueled a massive fundraising surge that puts his team in a position to ramp up advertising and swing state infrastructure just as voters begin paying closer attention to the election. Backed by Mellon’s massive donation, the pro-Trump super PAC known as MAGA Inc. reserved $3.5 million in television advertising set to begin July 3 across Georgia and Pennsylvania on Thursday, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. Overall, the group reported a $68.8 million haul for May, ending the month with $93.7 million in the bank. Mellon has been among the biggest donors to Trump and independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., although his support for Kennedy may be fading. Kennedy raised $2.6 million last month and finished May with $6.4 million in the bank. The vast majority of his fundraising total came from running mate Nicole Shanahan, a wealthy Silicon Valley lawyer. The Kennedy campaign spent more than it raised for the month. The numbers reported on Thursday did not include anything raised in June, including roughly $40 million raised by Biden and his top surrogates in recent days. The vast majority came from a glitzy fundraiser last Saturday with movie stars and former President Barack Obama in Los Angeles that raised more than $30 million. First lady Jill Biden also has been on her own personal fundraising swing that has brought in $1.5 million. Meanwhile, Biden also got a big boost from Bloomberg. The billionaire philanthropist, who briefly ran for president as a Democrat in 2020, sent $19 million to the pro-Biden group Future Forward in addition to sending the legal maximum of $929,600 to the Biden Victory Fund, according to a person familiar with the transfers. Bloomberg also formally endorsed Biden on Thursday. “I stood with Joe Biden in 2020, and I am proud to do so again,” Bloomberg said in a statement. The Biden campaign said that the vast majority of its latest fundraising came from grassroots donors such as nurses, teachers and retirees. Overall, the Biden campaign and Democratic National Committee attracted more than three million new donors last month, according to a statement from the campaign. “While Trump is leaching off his billionaire sycophants, our campaign represents the voices of America, and we’re honored to have their support as we race toward November,” Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said. • AP writer Seung Min Kim in Washington and Jill Colvin in New York contributed.",

But Trump&#8217;s fundraising &#8212; for one month at least &#8212; dwarfed Biden&#8217;s. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee said they raised a jaw-dropping $141 million in May. That includes tens of millions donated immediately after Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in the New York hush money case.",

                    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump’s campaign outraised President Joe Biden by more than $60 million last month, according to federal filings made public Thursday that detailed the Republican fundraising explosion sparked by Trump’s felony convictions. Biden’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee together raised a robust $85 million in May and reported $212 million in the bank at the end of the month. The strong showing does not include roughly $40 million raised by Biden and his top surrogates in recent days — or a separate $20 million donation from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to pro-Biden groups. Still, Trump’s fundraising for, for one month at least, seemed to dwarf Biden’s. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee said it raised a jaw-dropping $141 million in May, including tens of millions donated immediately after Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in the New York hush money case. At the same time, billionaire Timothy Mellon donated a stunning $50 million to a pro-Trump super PAC the day after Trump’s guilty verdict, according to the filings. Trump’s campaign declined to report how much money it had in the bank at the end of May, prompting Biden’s campaign to question whether the groups were still spending heavily to cover Trump’s legal fees. “Our strong and consistent fundraising program grew by millions of people in May, a clear sign of strong and growing enthusiasm for the president and vice president every single month,” said Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez. “The money we continue to raise matters, and it’s helping the campaign build out an operation that invests in reaching and winning the voters who will decide this election –- a stark contrast to Trump’s PR stunts and photo-ops that he’s pretending is a campaign.” Taken together, the numbers detailed in the campaigns’ latest Federal Election Commission filings suggest Democrats may still maintain a cash advantage in the 2024 presidential contest. But almost four months before Election Day, Trump’s side is closing the gap — if it isn’t closed already. The new fundraising figures also underscore the extent to which the rules of presidential politics are being rewritten in the Trump era. At almost any other time in U.S. history, a presidential candidate would have been forced to leave an election after being convicted of dozens of felonies. But in 2024, Trump’s guilty verdict has instead fueled a massive fundraising surge that puts his team in a position to ramp up advertising and swing- state infrastructure just as voters begin paying closer attention to the election. Backed by Mellon’s massive donation, the pro-Trump super PAC known as MAGA Inc. on Thursday reserved $3.5 million in television advertising set to begin July 3 across Georgia and Pennsylvania, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. Overall, the group reported a $68.8 million haul for May, ending the month with $93.7 million in the bank. Mellon has been among the biggest donors to Trump and independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., although his support for Kennedy may be fading. Kennedy raised $2.6 million last month and finished May with $6.4 million in the bank. The vast majority of his fundraising total came from running mate Nicole Shanahan, a wealthy Silicon Valley lawyer. The Kennedy campaign spent more than it raised for the month. The numbers reported Thursday did not include anything raised in June, including roughly $40 million raised by Biden and his top surrogates in recent days. The vast majority came from a glitzy fundraiser last Saturday with movie stars and former President Barack Obama in Los Angeles that raised more than $30 million. First lady Jill Biden also has been on her own personal fundraising swing that has brought in $1.5 million. Meanwhile, Biden also got a big boost from Bloomberg. The billionaire philanthropist, who briefly ran for president as a Democrat in 2020, sent $19 million to the pro-Biden group Future Forward in addition to sending the legal maximum of $929,600 to the Biden Victory Fund, according to a person familiar with the transfers. Bloomberg also formally endorsed Biden on Thursday. “I stood with Joe Biden in 2020, and I am proud to do so again,” Bloomberg said in a statement. The Biden campaign said the vast majority of its latest fundraising came from grassroots donors such as nurses, teachers and retirees. Overall, the Biden campaign and Democratic National Committee attracted more than 3 million new donors last month, according to a statement from the campaign. “While Trump is leeching off his billionaire sycophants, our campaign represents the voices of America, and we’re honored to have their support as we race toward November,” Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said. ___ AP writers Seung Min Kim in Washington and Jill Colvin in New York contributed.",

                    "text": "Will Jason Kelce finally be making his Eras Tour debut? The former Philadelphia Eagles star, 36, was photographed out and about in London on Friday ahead of Taylor Swift’s concert at Wembley Stadium. Kelce could be seen posing for photos with fans in a pub in a photo shared to X. Per usual, the athlete dressed down for the occasion, wearing his go-to brown shawl neck sweater, shorts and, of course, flip-flops. “jason kelce in London???” the user wrote. “oh tonight is about to go OFF.” Meanwhile, others joked that they couldn’t wait to see him “shirtless, drunk, and shouting the lyrics” — like his now-famous moment at the Kansas City Chiefs game against the Buffalo Bills. “i just KNOW we’re about to get so many new jason kelce memes in the vip tent oh boy,” a third said. Although his wife, Kylie Kelce, joined him at the Cannes Lions Festival earlier this week, the mother of three wasn’t seen in the photo. Jason’s brother, Travis Kelce, started dating Swift last summer. However, he and Kylie have yet to see one of her record-breaking concerts in person. Although it’s unclear if the couple brought their daughters — Wyatt, 4, Elliotte, 3, and Bennett, 1 — with them, the former athlete recently gushed about how Travis’ relationship with the “Cruel Summer” singer has impacted his role as a dad. While speaking at Stagwell Sport Beach, the brothers admitted that the unwavering support from the Swifties is largely to blame for the success of their “New Heights” podcast. Jason said he loves helping girls “get involved in a sport where previously there wasn’t much interest,” while also bringing dads and daughters together. He explained that the podcast has allowed the pop culture world and the sports world to “collide, which is awesome.” Following the panel, the brothers seemingly flew to the United Kingdom, where Travis will finally reunite with Swift after a month apart. Along with the Kelces, Swift’s bestie Keleigh Teller also posted from London on Thursday night, proving the event is likely to be quite star-studded. Unlike Jason and Kylie, Keleigh has been to a few of Swift’s shows alongside her husband, Miles Teller — including back-to-back shows in New Jersey in May 2023. The “All Too Well” singer is set to play three shows in London before moving on to Dublin.",

                    "text": "Prince William celebrated his 42nd birthday Friday evening at Taylor Swift’s first Eras Tour concert in London with his three children — George, 10, Charlotte, 9, and Louis, 6 — according to royal reporter Roya Nikkhah. Kate Middleton, who announced she was undergoing “preventative chemotherapy” for cancer in March, was not reported to be present at the show. Page Six reached out to reps for Swift and the Prince of Wales to confirm his attendance but did not immediately receive a response. While photo evidence has yet to be revealed, it would be no surprise if William took the trip to Wembley Stadium to ring in his new year of life with his kids. He previously got up on stage with the “Cruel Summer” hitmaker, 34, and Bon Jovi, 62, at the Centrepoint Gala charity dinner at Kensington Palace in London in November 2013 and sang “Living on a Prayer.” He later admitted to “cringing” at the moment on Apple Fitness+’s “Time to Walk” podcast in 2021. “To this day, I still do not know what came over me … But, frankly, if Taylor Swift looks you in the eye, touches your arm, and says, ‘Come with me…’ I got up like a puppy and went, ‘Yeah, okay, that seems like a great idea. I’ll follow you,'” he recalled. “I walked up on stage in a trance, and then sort of halfway through Jon Bon Jovi’s ‘Livin’ on a Prayer’ song, I wake up, and I’m thinking to myself, ‘Am I standing on the stage singing…when I don’t even know the words?'” Swift’s concert Friday evening not only marked the first show in England’s capital for her record-breaking tour, but the first show she’s played in the city since her breakup from British actor Joe Alwyn. The split is thought to have inspired her “TTPD” song, “So Long, London.” In addition to performing for royalty, Swift’s return to London was made special with the support of her beau, Travis Kelce, his brother, Jason, and Jason’s wife, Kylie. They all got into the Swiftie spirit by trading friendship bracelets, with Jason compiling an entire forearm full thanks to her dedicated fans. Travis, 34, and Swift’s dad, Scott, were also spotted greeting each other with a friendly handshake on the floor or Wembley Stadium ahead of the concert. “Bridgerton” star Nicola Coughlan was also photographed trading friendship bracelets at Swift’s show.",

                    "text": "“London Boy” has arrived. Prince William celebrated his 42nd birthday by attending Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour show at Wembley Stadium in London on Friday — and brought along children Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 9, and Prince Louis, 6. “Nothing says happy 42nd birthday quite like taking the kids to see a @taylorswift13 #ErasTour gig,” royal reporter Roya Nikkhah shared on X, formerly Twitter. “Prince William is celebrating his birthday tonight at @wembleystadium with his children.” ABC News also confirmed their attendance. However, Us Weekly reports that Louis may have stayed home. Hours earlier, the royal guard band played “Shake It Off” in front of Buckingham Palace to welcome the musician, 34, into town. Her NFL Kansas City Chiefs boyfriend Travis Kelce, his brother Jason Kelce and sister-in-law Kylie Kelce also traveled across the pond to support her. Swift has three shows in London on June 21-23. After Sunday, she’ll take a break before heading to the Johan Cruijff Arena in Amsterdam, NL, on July 4. Prince William’s estranged sister-in-law Meghan Markle, meanwhile, attended Swift’s August 2023 tour stop in Los Angeles. The future king has met the “Maroon” singer before. In 2013, he, Swift and Jon Bon Jovi performed a rendition of “Livin’ on a Prayer” during a Centrepoint charity event at Kensington Palace. “So, around about — it must be nearly 10 years ago now — I can’t believe I’m actually telling this story,” Prince William said on an episode of Apple Fitness+’s Time to Walk series in 2021. “I went to a charity fundraising gala for Centrepoint, which is a young homeless charity that I am very fond of and have supported for many years. It’s an annual fundraiser, and I turn up, and Jon Bon Jovi and Taylor Swift are at the event, which nearly knocked me off my feet as well.” “When I sat down to watch Jon Bon Jovi do his performance, I thought, ‘That’s it. My job is done. I’ll get a dinner in a minute, and I might be able to have a chat to some people, and, you know, I’m off-duty a little bit now.’ Little did I think what was going to happen next,” he continued. “I’m sat next to Taylor Swift. She’s on my left. And after Jon does his first song, there’s a pause and she turns to me. She puts her hand on my arm, looks me in the eye, and says, ‘Come on, William. Let’s go and sing.’ “ He joked that he still doesn’t know what “came over” him in the moment to oblige. “Honestly, even now, I’m cringing at what happened next, and I don’t understand why I gave in. But, frankly, if Taylor Swift looks you in the eye, touches your arm, and says, ‘Come with me…’ I got up like a puppy and went, ‘Yeah, okay, that seems like a great idea. I’ll follow you,'” he gushed. Prince William’s family outing Friday comes nearly a week since they attended the Trooping the Colour festivities in honor of King Charles’ birthday on June 15. The festivities marked the first time Kate Middleton made a public appearance since announcing her cancer diagnosis. She joined the rest of the royal family and stood next to the monarch on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to watch the traditional military flyover. Last year, Prince William was the one to stand next to his father. Royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams told The Sun that the positioning was perhaps a “gesture of solidarity and support,” as King Charles is battling his own cancer. “Let’s be frank. It would have been very stressful to go through with all of the ceremony,” he said. “King Charles and the Princess of Wales knew very well every movement would be photographed that was public.” Expert Judi James added: “Kate’s body language here showed the world what being a royal is all about: elegant, calm and stoic with not one smallest jot of self-pity or drama. Kate’s non-verbal messages seem to signal a smiling determination to reassure the public and her own children and to get on with the job.” The Princess of Wales stunned as she wore a white Jenny Packham dress with a black-striped belt decorated with a black-and-white bow for the occasion. One day earlier, she announced she would be attending the event. “I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there aregood days and bad days,” the 42-year-old said in a statement. “On those bad days you feel weak, tired and you have to give in to your body resting. But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well.” “I’m looking forward to attending The King’s Birthday Parade this weekend with my familyand hope to join a few public engagements over the summer, but equally knowing I am notout of the woods yet,” she went on. “I am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty. Taking each day as it comes, listening to my body, and allowing myself to take this much-needed time to heal.”",

                    "text": "Prince William and his three children reportedly celebrated his 42nd birthday by attending Taylor Swift's Eras Tour concert at London's Wembley Stadium on Friday. The Duke of Cambridge, his sons Prince George, 10, and Prince Louis, 6, and his daughter Princess Charlotte were among the crowd of 90,000 Swifties at the 34-year-old pop star's sold-out show, according to royal reporter Roya Nikkah. \"Nothing says happy 42nd birthday quite like taking the kids to see a @taylorswift13#ErasTour gig. Prince William is celebrating his birthday tonight at @wembleystadium with his children,\" Nikkah wrote on X. William's wife Kate Middleton reportedly did not join her husband and children at the concert. The 42-year-old Princess of Wales is undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer and has mostly stayed out of the spotlight over the past few months. PRINCE WILLIAM'S DEVOTION TO KATE MIDDLETON DEEPER THAN EVER AS HEIR CELEBRATES 'BITTERSWEET' BIRTHDAY: EXPERT Middleton made her first public appearance since Christmas last weekend when she attended Trooping of the Colour. The royal ceremony celebrated the birthday of King Charles III, who is also battling cancer. The princess announced that she would be attending Trooping the Colour ahead of the event in a statement shared on Instagram. Middleton wrote that she hopes to attend \"a few public engagements over the summer\" but acknowledged that she is \"not out of the woods yet.\" William first met Swift in 2013 at a Centrepoint Gala Dinner that was held at Kensington Palace. The royal later joined Swift and Bon Jovi for a performance of the rock icon's hit 1986 song \"Livin' on a Prayer.\" During a 2021 episode of Apple Fitness+'s \"Time to Walk\" series, William shared the story behind the viral moment. \"So, around about — it must be nearly 10 years ago now — I can't believe I'm actually telling this story,\" he said \"I went to a charity fundraising gala for Centrepoint, which is a young homeless charity that I am very fond of and have supported for many years. It's an annual fundraiser, and I turn up, and Jon Bon Jovi and Taylor Swift are at the event, which nearly knocked me off my feet as well.\" William continued, \"When I sat down to watch Jon Bon Jovi do his performance, I thought, 'That's it.

She puts her hand on my arm, looks me in the eye, and says, 'Come on, William. Let's go and sing,'\" he recalled. KATE MIDDLETON WILL NOT ‘RECEDE INTO THE SHADOWS,’ PLANS FULL RETURN TO ROYAL LIFE: EXPERT \"To this day, I still do not know what came over me,\" William added.\"Honestly, even now, I'm cringing at what happened next, and I don't understand why I gave in. But, frankly, if Taylor Swift looks you in the eye, touches your arm, and says, 'Come with me…' I got up like a puppy and went, 'Yeah, okay, that seems like a great idea. I'll follow you.' \" Ahead of William and his children's reported outing on Friday, Swift received a royal welcome to the United Kingdom from Buckingham Palace. On Friday, the Royal Family and the Army in London's official Instagram accounts shared a video of the Changing of the Guard, a royal ceremony, during which the Military band played Swift's hit \"Shake It Off\" in front of Buckingham Palace. \"Can’t stop, won’t stop grooving,\" the caption read.

Earlier this month, Swift celebrated her 100th show in Liverpool, England, and addressed the end of her international tour for the first time. Over the past year, the 14-time Grammy Award-winner has been known to add dates to her tour. \"I think a lot of people are like, ‘Well, how are you going to celebrate the 100th show?’\" Swift told the crowd, according to Entertainment Weekly. \"And for me, the celebration of the 100th show for me means this is the very first time I've ever acknowledged to myself and admitted that this tour is gonna end in December.\" \"Like, that's it,\" the award-winning singer-songwriter added. \"That feels like so far away from now. But then again, it feels like I just did my first show on this tour, because you guys have made this so much fun for us that we wanted to do 100 shows, 150-something shows,\" she continued. Swift admitted that the \"Eras Tour\" has \"become my entire life.\" She joked that she's forgotten her hobbies, because \"all I do when I'm not on stage is just like sit at home and try to think of some clever acoustic song mashups and thinking about what you might like to hear.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital's Janelle Ash contributed to this post.",

                    "text": "Hockey fans officially have a compelling Stanley Cup Final.Going into Game 6 on Friday night at Rogers Place at 8 p.m. ET on ABC, Florida -- despite one-sided losses in Games 4 and 5 -- is -350 to win the series, and Edmonton is +280 at BetMGM.At DraftKings, Florida is -345 to hold on and raise the Stanley Cup, while Edmonton remains a series longshot at +270.The way Edmonton won Game 4 -- blowing out Florida 8-1 after chasing Sergei Bobrovsky -- gave Oilers fans hope of a historic comeback from down 3-0.Sure enough, Connor McDavid and co. jumped out to an early lead on the road in Game 5, building a 4-1 cushion in the second period. The Panthers cut that lead to 4-3 late, but Edmonton got a empty-net goal late and held on to, in McDavid's words, \"drag Florida back to Edmonton\" for Game 6 on Friday night.For Friday's matchup at what should be a raucous Rogers Place, the Oilers are slight favorites (-120 at FanDuel) to force Game 7, while Florida is even money. FanDuel's Over/Under is 5.5, as it has been for every game in this series, (Over -106, Under -114).Stanley Cup Final Game 6 Betting AnalysisNote: the following admittedly gives no credit to the Panthers, who built a 3-0 lead and nearly came back from down 4-1 in Game 5.But it just feels unwise to bet against Edmonton right now, and not just because of Connor McDavid, who has a chance to complete a historic individual run through the playoffs with two more wins.McDavid has 11 points in this series, including eight in Games 4 and 5 alone, and he's already set a new record for assists in a postseason, with 34 (and counting). Additionally, with 42 points and as many as two games remaining, he has a real chance to break another longstanding Wayne Gretzky record: most points in a single playoffs (47).The Oilers have also dominated the special teams battle in the last two games of this series, with three power play goals and two more shorthanded, while Florida has not scored on the power play since Game 2.Between this version of McDavid, a power play that is clicking at the right time, a goalie, Stuart Skinner, who has quietly outplayed Bobrovsky over the last 120 minutes -- a development no one could have imagined after Games 1 and 2 -- and a rowdy home crowd, it's hard to shake the feeling that this series has Game 7 written all over it.With that in mind, let's get to a few plays for tonight:Play 1: Edmonton Puck Line: -1.5 (+215) at DraftKingsUnfortunately, Edmonton to win at -120 doesn't offer a ton of value. The strong possibility of the Oilers' home crowd -- which helped them win Game 4 8-1 -- helping this team build a big lead makes this a great value play.Another reason to consider the puck line: even if the game is close, a one-goal lead late could very well cover this with another empty-net goal like the one McDavid bagged to ice Game 5.Play 2: Connor McDavid Over 1.5 Points (-130) at DraftKingsThere's a (justifiable) temptation to hammer a bigger number at a more lucrative price, but let's play it safe and go with McDavid to get to two points. This feels inevitable considering how many he's had game by game in this series: Connor McDavid Points Game 1 0 Game 2 1 (1 assist) Game 3 2 (2 assists) Game 4 4 (1 goal, 3 assists) Game 5 4 (2 goals, 2 assists) Play 3: Over 5.5 (-106) at FanDuelThe two low-scoring games to start this series feel like distant memories now.Following a seven-goal Game 3, Edmonton has turned the last two games into shootouts. The Oilers alone scored six goals in the first 40 minutes of Game 4 and added four more in the first two periods of Game 5 to drive the totals in those games to nine and eight, respectively.Newsweek may earn an affiliate commission if you sign up through the links in this article.

Since having the chance to sweep the Oilers in the Stanley Cup Final, things have gone the other way as Florida heads back to Canada for Game 6 with the prospect of a Game 7 looming. The Oilers come into Game 6 on home ice as slight -120 favorites to send he series back to Sunset Arena with history on the line. A team has battled back from a 3-0 series deficit to force a Game 7 nine times in NHL history, with four of those teams winning Game 7. It has happened just one time in Stanley Cup Finals history, though, via the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs rallying to down the Red Wings Before Edmonton can get excited about being the second hockey team to make Cup Final history, they it first need to take care of business at home as -120 favorites on BetMGM. Panthers vs. Oilers prediction Things have seemingly unraveled for Florida as Sergei Bobrovsky went from the overwhelming favorite to win the Conn Smythe to on the outside looking in. Stuart Skinner appears to be the advantage goalie in this matchup right now, holding the Panthers down with an excellent 93.8 save percent over the last two games. Skinner did this same Houdini act against the Dallas Stars last series, who appeared to have his number before he crushed their dreams in Games 5 and 6. The Oilers’ attack has been aided by Connor McDavid going back to his roots as the league’s premier passer, setting a record for assists in NHL playoff history. Betting on the NHL?

An overtime affair in Edmonton with a chance to really turn up the heat in South Florida is the prediction.

                    "text": "Commercial Content. 21+. Action Network is the official betting partner of the Chicago Tribune. The Oilers have the Stanley Cup Final back on serve. Led by Connor McDavid, they have outscored the Panthers, 13-4, in the last two games and now have the opportunity to force a Game 7 after trailing 3-0. The betting market views Game 6 in Edmonton as essentially a coin flip, but the hockey world seems to believe the momentum is clearly with the Oilers after two legacy-raising performances from McDavid. Here are three of our best bets for the game. Panthers vs. Oilers Game 6 best bets By Nick Martin One of the more consistent trends in the NHL this postseason has been Games 6 and 7 averaging far lower totals than the rest of the series and lower than oddsmakers are expecting. Unders in Games 6 and 7 are 10-1-1 in the playoffs, and the first-period under is 10-2, including six games that had no score after the first period. Players generally look to ease into spots like this making conservative and safe plays, while attention to detail on defense is always at the forefront of the game plan. Nick’s pick: First-period under 1.5 goals (-120 at BetMGM) By Tony Satori Not only has Connor McDavid lead Edmonton to consecutive victories, but he also scored three goals and added five assists. This is one of the best individual runs in playoff history, and the Panthers are finding it difficult to slow him down. To make matters worse, goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky has started to regress. He is 1-2 over the past three games for Florida with a .838 SV% and 5.05 GAA. If Florida is to go on and finally clinch the Stanley Cup Final in Game 6, it will be in a high-scoring game, which puts McDavid in position to play a big part for the Oilers. Tony’s pick: Connor McDavid to score a goal (+135 at FanDuel) By Michael Leboff While momentum is with Edmonton, you do have to wonder if the blueprint we saw in Game 5 is sustainable. The Oilers got ahead on a shorthanded goal, added a couple of markers on the power play and were gifted an ugly one by Sergei Bobrovsky. The Panthers have come a bit unglued over the past two games. Florida’s discipline has deserted it at perhaps the worst possible time and the Panthers will need to get a grip if they want to avoid the pressure-cooker of a Game 7 after blowing a 3-0 lead. This sets up to be a tight game and I’d expect the first 20 minutes to be quite cagey, with both teams trying to avoid making a big mistake and go behind early. That puts plenty of value on the first period to end scoreless at +350. Michael’s pick: First-period 0-0 tie (+350 at FanDuel)",

                    "text": "The Florida Panthers aim to avoid having to play one more home game when they visit the Edmonton Oilers on Friday for Game 6 of the 2024 Stanley Cup Final. Florida won the first three games of the series to get within one victory of the first championship in franchise history but has been unable to seal the deal, getting outscored 13-4 in losing the last two contests -- including Game 5 at home. Edmonton will attempt to become just the third team in history to force a Game 7 after trailing 0-3 in the Stanley Cup Final. Opening faceoff at Rogers Place is set for 8 p.m. ET. Edmonton is a -120 favorite (risk $120 to win $100) in the latest Oilers vs. Panthers odds, while the over/under for total goals scored is 5.5. Before making any Panthers vs. Oilers picks, you need to check out the NHL predictions from the SportsLine Projection Model. SportsLine's model simulates every NHL game 10,000 times, taking into account factors like current form, individual matchups, injuries and short- and long-term trends when making NHL picks. It entered the 2024 Stanley Cup Final on a 7-4 run on top-rated puck-line picks. Now, the model has set its sights on Oilers vs. Panthers and just locked in its NHL picks and Stanley Cup Final predictions. You can visit SportsLine now to see the picks. Here are the latest NHL odds and trends for Panthers vs. Oilers: Oilers vs. Panthers money line: Edmonton -120, Florida +100Oilers vs. Panthers over/under: 5.5 goalsOilers vs. Panthers puck line: Edmonton -1.5 (+210)EDM: The Oilers have outscored Florida 15-4 over the last seven periodsFLA: The Panthers have allowed 13 goals in the last two games after yielding 12 over six contests against the New York RangersOilers vs. Panthers picks: See picks at SportsLine Why you should back the Oilers Limited to a total of just one goal in the first two games of the Stanley Cup Final, Edmonton has produced 16 over the last three contests. The club has netted five tallies in the third period over that span after scoring one in the session over its previous nine contests. The Oilers' special teams have been dangerous since the team was pushed to the brink of elimination, recording three power-play goals and a pair of short-handers in the last two games. Edmonton owns a 93.9% success rate on the penalty kill, the highest mark over a minimum of 15 games in a postseason since 1978, and has denied its opponents on 43 of their last 44 power-play opportunities while scoring three short-handed goals during that stretch. The Oilers possess five of the eight players with 20 or more points this postseason, with superstar Connor McDavid leading the NHL with 42 -- five shy of the all-time record set in 1985 by the legendary Wayne Gretzky. Evan Bouchard is second with 32, the most by a defenseman in one playoff year, and Leon Draisaitl has collected 30 while Zach Hyman -- who has scored a league-high 15 goals -- and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins have notched 21 apiece. See who to back at SportsLine. Why you should back the Panthers Florida has yet to lose three games in a series this postseason and dropped three in a row only twice during the regular season, most recently when they suffered four straight defeats from March 14-23. Matthew Tkachuk came up with his best performance of the Final in Game 5, scoring a goal and setting up another. The 26-year-old left wing recorded just one assist over his previous six contests, including the final two of the Eastern Conference Final against the New York Rangers. Tkachuk leads the Panthers with 22 points this postseason and needs two to match the franchise record for most in one playoff year, which he set during the team's run to the Stanley Cup Final last year. Carter Verhaeghe has gone four games without a point but remains Florida's top goal scorer with 10, one shy of Tkachuk's franchise postseason mark (2023). Fellow center Evan Rodrigues netted his fourth tally of the series on Tuesday after recording just three over the first three rounds of the playoffs and has landed on the scoresheet in five of his last six contests. Meanwhile, Sam Bennett has been held without a point in only five of his 17 outings this postseason. See who to back at SportsLine.

While he didn't provide an update on his condition, Sanders wrote on social media that he is \"taking this opportunity to prioritize my health and well-being.\" \"It was unexpected and served as a reminder of the importance of staying vigilant about our physical well-being, even when we are feeling fine,\" Sanders wrote. \"I am grateful for the amazing doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals for providing me with needed care. My family and I are thankful for your prayers and support during this time.\" Sanders, 55, currently serves as an ambassador for the Lions. He was recently seen at the 2024 NFL Draft, which was held in Detroit. During the draft, Bill Belichick said that Sanders was the most difficult opponent to defend during his 49 years as an NFL coach. In January, Sanders and former 49ers Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana served as honorary captains for the NFC Championship game, which was won by the 49ers over Sanders' Lions. Last September, Sanders became the first Lions player to have a statue built in his honor. In November, Amazon Prime released a documentary on Sanders detailing his career and his decision to retire despite being less than 1,500 yards away from breaking Walter Payton's all-time career rushing record. A first-ballot Hall of Famer, Sanders is the first player to rush for over 1,000 years in each of his first 10 seasons. He won four rushing titles during his 10-year career (that spanned from 1989-98) and in 1997 became the third player in history to rush for over 2,000 yards in a season. Sanders shared league MVP honors that season with then-Packers quarterback Brett Favre.",

                    "text": "One of the best running backs in NFL history shared some concerning news on Friday. Former Lions great Barry Sanders announced on X that he “experienced a health scare related to his heart” last weekend. Sanders added that the event was “unexpected” but did not disclose any information about the severity of the injury or his current condition. Additionally, the Hall-of-Famer said that he is “taking this opportunity to prioritize my health and well-being.” Sanders’ post drew messages of support around the football community. “Get well soon Barry” was inscribed on a graphic created by the Detroit Lions’ X account. “We’re thinking of you, Barry,” wrote the College Football Hall of Fame, of which Sanders is a member. Sanders was seen signing autographs and meeting fans at the Detroit Sports Spectacular event last weekend. The icon also made a cameo during the 2024 NFL Draft, which was held in Detroit in late April. The Oklahoma State alum ranks fourth in NFL history with 15,269 rushing yards, which he accomplished in only 10 seasons. He made the Pro Bowl every year of his prodigious career and tacked on six All-Pro nods. Still only 55, Sanders’ retirement came famously early at just 31. The 5-foot-8 running back partially attributed him stepping away due to ongoing futility from Lions management. In September 2023, the Lions unveiled a statue in honor of Sanders, one of the most beloved players to ever don Honolulu Blue and one of the most electrifying players in football history. Sanders generally had a clean bill of health during his brief but memorable career. In 1993, he missed five games with a torn left ACL. However, he played in at least 15 of 16 games in each of the other nine seasons he played in Detroit. Since calling it a career in 1998, Sanders has stayed in touch with football through his social media channels, posting often about throwbacks to his playing days and retweeting supporters that share promotional materials, such as the Madden NFL 25 cover he graced in 2013.",

                    "text": "Hall of Fame running back Barry Sanders experienced a heart-related health scare last weekend, he said in a statement posted to social media Friday. Sanders did not offer details on the exact nature of his condition, but described the experience as \"unexpected\" and \"a reminder of the importance of staying vigilant about our physical well-being, even when we are feeling fine.\" In his statement, the Detroit Lions legend also shared his gratitude for the doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals who treated him. Sanders, who turns 56 next month, went on to say that per doctor recommendation, he is \"taking this opportunity to prioritize my health and well-being.\" The Lions issued their own social media post saying, \"Get well soon Barry.\" Sanders was a six-time All-Pro while starring for the Lions from 1989-98 before his sudden retirement at age 31. One of the most electrifying players in league history, Sanders is fourth on the NFL's career rushing list with 15,269 yards in just 10 seasons, including 2,053 yards in his MVP season of 1997. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2004. Sanders spent his entire career with the Lions, who selected him with the third overall pick in the 1989 NFL draft after his Heisman Trophy-winning season with Oklahoma State. Last season, the Lions unveiled a statue outside Ford Field of Sanders, the first player in franchise history to receive such an honor. Information from ESPN's Eric Woodyard and The Associated Press was included in this report.",

                    "text": "The Stanley Cup will be in the building once again on Friday night with the Florida Panthers getting their third chance to win the first championship in franchise history in Game 6 against the Edmonton Oilers. The Panthers led the series 3-0 before losing back-to-back games. “There’s no way necessarily to prepare for that new experience,” Panthers coach Paul Maurice said Thursday in Fort Lauderdale before traveling back to Alberta. “Now, we’ve got kind of two games under our belt ... so we’re learning. We’re learning how to do this. We’re learning how to feel it.” To close out the series and finally be atop the NHL, Florida will have to deal with Connor McDavid likely cruising to playoff MVP honors and a raucous sellout crowd of over 18,000 fans hoping to see their team force a Game 7 in South Florida on Monday night. Oilers fever is alive and well in the city of nearly a million people trying to will the their team back across North America. “It’s been incredible to witness,” said veteran winger Corey Perry, who is in the final for the fourth time in five seasons. “Everybody notices it. You can hear them honking the horns when we’re in our dressing room. You can hear everything. It’s pretty special, pretty tremendous to be here and going through that.” They are back in Edmonton thanks in large part to McDavid, Edmonton’s captain who had four points apiece in Games 4 and 5. He is the first player in league history with consecutive four-point games in the final, and his 42 are five shy of Wayne Gretzky’s record set in 1985. “Connor doing Connor things,” linemate Zach Hyman said. “That’s what makes him special. He’s able to elevate his game at the most important time — the biggest reason why we’ve come so far. We’re not here without him. He continues to drive the bus.” Matthew Tkachuk drove it for the Panthers in Game 5, the second-best player on the ice behind McDavid with a long gap to who might have been third. Tkachuk scored a goal and assisted on another, sparking a comeback bid that fell just short despite his diving save to keep the puck out of an empty net in the final minute. “He’s one of the best players in the world,” teammate Ryan Lomberg said. “He’s one of our main leaders. When guys like that lead by example, everybody else is well on board.”",

                    "text": "EDMONTON, AB. – Drag them back to Alberta.

The matchup is available on multiple streaming services for free. Today’s game will broadcast live on ABC and stream on ESPN+ with the puck dropping at 8 p.m. Eastern. (6 p.m. Mountain).

How do I watch the Stanley Cup Finals for free? You can watch Game 4 for free by utilizing free trials from FuboTV and DirecTV Stream. A thriller in the Sunshine State The Oilers outlasted the Panthers in an instant classic in Game 5, forcing Florida 2,997 miles back north. Drag them back to Alberta, indeed. Every time Florida seemed like it was going to sneak back, Connor McDavid and Edmonton were there to shut the door, including a dazzling sequence where Matthew Tkachuk slid from center ice to halt a creeping puck heading straight for an empty net only to have McDavid hammer it home to finally clinch the 5-3 victory. He became the first player in NHL Playoff history to have back-to-back four-point games in the Stanley Cup Final as he tallied two goals and two assists. Evan Bouchard notched three assists in a power performance on the road. Connor Brown, Zach Hyman and Corey Perry also tallied goals. Stuart Skinner continued his dynamic play with 29 saves. After shaky starts through the playoffs, Skinner has elevated his game to match the moment of the Stanley Cup Finals. Evan Rodrigues (fourth of the series) and Tkachuk each nabbed a goal and an assist for Florida, as did Oliver Ekman-Larsson. They were playing behind all evening. Even the sturdiest nerves were shaken as the Stanley Cup was in the building for a franchise who had never won it before. Now they are two losses away from blowing a 3-0 lead in the Stanley Cup Finals, which has only ever been done once. Carrying over from dominant 8-1 victory, the Oilers jumped out to a 3-0 lead behind another shorthanded goal. Connor Brown connected on the disadvantage turned advantage as the Oilers fiery momentum was visible across the ice. Interference by Florida’s Niko Mikkola as time expired in the first set up Hyman’s turn to shine on the power play as he made it 2-0 in the opening seconds of the second period. McDavid notched a goal three minutes later, and it appeared the rout was on. Panthers’ goalie Sergei Bobrovsky was again shelled, halting 19 shots for Florida. He has allowed nine goals in the past two games. Striking numbers from someone who was considered a strong candidate for the Conn Smythe Trophy just a week ago. The Panthers have allowed 13 goals in the last two games. They allowed 12 total in the entire six-game Eastern Conference Finals series against the New York Rangers. No team has ever lost after leading by three in a title-series game since Edmonton against Carolina in 2006. The Panthers tried to make history of their own while still trying to avoid the ultimate meltdown. The Panthers struck for two in the second period, to revive a stunned Amerant Bank Arena and send chills across the ice. After McDavid had set up Perry with a beautiful pass flying by the net for the score, it was 4-2 heading into a final period, and Florida was attacking at will. Ekman-Larsson broke through four minutes into the third to pull the Panthers within one. The Oilers’ special teams have been lethal since the team was pushed to the brink. They have tallied three power-play goals and a pair of short-handed goals in the last two games. Furthermore, the penalty kill has been nearly flawless, having denied its opponents on 43 of their last 44 power-play opportunities. With their fans on edge, Florida battled through an intense third period. Their moment never arrived. Instead, Bobrovsky left the net with just over three minutes left, that set up the thrilling final sequence. Survival at its finest. The Oilers have outscored the Panthers 15-4 over the last seven periods. A colossal swing of momentum could turn a pipe dream into reality. Relive the thrilling Game 5 with this video recap below.

                    "text": "Jennifer Lawrence already has many career highlights, including taking home the Best Actress Oscar. Now there's one more thing the 33-year-old can add to the list: starring in a movie inspired by her beloved Real Housewives franchise. Apple Original Films announced Friday that the Silver Linings Playbook actress will produce and star in a murder mystery called The Wives. Fellow producers include Justine Ciarrocchi, Josh Godfrey, and Jeremy O. Harris, who posted on X that the project is \"the culmination of almost 7 years of work.\" While plot details have yet to be revealed, the movie will be written by Michael Breslin and Patrick Foley, who wrote and performed the acclaimed theater production, This American Wife. Want more movie news? Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free newsletter to get the latest trailers, celebrity interviews, film reviews, and more. Lawrence has been open about her interest in reality TV for years, especially the women who populate Bravo's shows based on socialites in locations ranging from New York City to Atlanta, Miami, and beyond. She raved about her obsession in an October 2014 Vanity Fair story. \"I do love my Real Housewives,\" she said. \"New York Housewives, and Beverly Hills, New Jersey and Atlanta Housewives. I mean, I love them all, but Miami — oh, my God! Miami is really special.\" Lawrence's love of reality television was still going strong in December 2017, when Oprah Winfrey interviewed her for The Hollywood Reporter and asked which three people, living or dead, she would like to have dinner with. She responded, \"Scott Disick [from Keeping Up With the Kardashians], Luann [de Lesseps] from Real Housewives of New York, Bethenny Frankel [also formerly from RHONY]. And I'm not proud of that, but that's what comes from my heart.\" Happily, Watch What Happens Live host and Housewives producer Andy Cohen made some of Lawrence's wish come true in March 2018, when he threw her a surprise dinner party, with de Lesseps and Frankel as guests, on an episode of his show.",

Eight months later, they toasted the franchise’s 18th championship in what has become the signature Boston celebration, joined Friday by a huge crowd for a duck boat parade to mark the 13th championship won this century by one of the city’s franchises in the four biggest U.S. sports leagues. The Celtics, Patriots, Red Sox and Bruins have all commemorated championships by jumping aboard the duck boats — amphibious vehicles usually ridden by sightseeing tourists. In Boston, firing up the boats for a slow cruise down city streets has become synonymous with its feeling of sports supremacy. Friday’s parade was the latest component of what has been a rolling salute to the Celtics since they finished off the Dallas Mavericks in five games in the NBA Finals on Monday night. Starting at TD Garden, the procession lasted about 90 minutes, turning first onto Causeway Street in front of the arena, past City Hall, through Boston Common, down Boylston Street and ending at Hynes Convention Center. Along the way, there were plenty of moments for the city to salute a franchise that just broke a tie with the rival Los Angeles Lakers for the most titles in league history. Fans marked the moment by hanging on light posts, flashing homemade signs or standing on subway entrances. “It’s unbelievable. It still doesn’t seem true. But just trying to stay in the moment,” All-Star Jayson Tatum said during a pre-parade rally at the Garden. Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck gave fans an early treat about 90 minutes before the trade began. He was attempting to drive to the arena with the Larry O’Brien Trophy and newly made 2024 championship banner along with his wife, Emilia Fazzalari, and their daughter. They couldn’t get through because of traffic and barricades. So they walked a half-mile down Causeway Street, passing by a sea of fans while carrying the trophy and banner. Inside the Garden, the rally included players and their family members, members of the Celtics organization, arena staff, season ticket holders and guests including Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu. After celebrating in the locker room Monday night by spraying Champagne and posing for pictures with the trophy, the team flew to Miami for a private party. When the Celtics returned Wednesday, coach Joe Mazzulla took the party back to people, allowing fans to see the trophy up close — and in some cases touch it — while he carried it through Boston’s famed North End. “I drove all the way from Ohio (Wednesday) because we were coming for the parade,” Celtics fan Jason Hawkins told Boston’s ABC affiliate, WCVB-TV. “I touched trophy, man. I got video of it.” The golden basketball was on display for all to see Friday as players, flanked by Celtics personnel and members of their families, waved and interacted with fans. The Celtics broke every huddle this season by saying, “Together.” Jaylen Brown said Friday the theme for this year’s team was unity. “Whatever it took for us to win, that’s what I was willing to do,” Brown said. As much as the day was a celebration of that team-first mantra that Mazzulla championed this season, it was also the culmination of mission that stars Brown and Tatum began after each was drafted third overall — Brown in 2016 and Tatum a year later. The duo made it to four conference finals and one NBA Finals — a loss to the Golden State Warriors in 2022 — before finally reaching the league pinnacle. Brown earned Finals MVP honors, which he said also belonged to his “partner in crime.” While the city had to wait nearly two decades for this celebration, the Celtics are in a solid position to try to become the NBA’s first back-to-back champions since the Warriors in 2018. All five starters — Tatum, Brown, Jrue Holiday, Derrick White and Kristaps Porzingis — are under contract for next season. After having secured long-term extensions with Brown, Holiday and Porzingis, the Celtics are expected to do the same with Tatum and White this summer. Reserve Luke Kornet didn’t let fans forget the Celtics’ history of titles, leading fans on a count from one to 18 at the end of the parade route. Their message to the city is clear: Keep the duck boats gassed up. Comments are not available on this story.",

                    "title": "Five men were convicted for running Jetflicks, a low-cost streaming service that amassed more TV shows than Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime combined",
                    "text": "A federal jury in Las Vegas convicted five male defendants for their roles in a complex scheme of scraping popular television shows and award-winning movies from pirate sites and bundling them into a streaming service called Jetflicks, said the Department of Justice in a statement on Thursday. According to the indictment, Jetflicks operated as a subscription-based streamer that allowed users to watch and download copyrighted TV shows and movies without permission from the copyright owners. “The defendants operated Jetflicks, an illicit streaming service they used to distribute hundreds of thousands of stolen television episodes,” said principal deputy assistant attorney general Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, in a statement. According to the DOJ, the group ripped off thousands of copyrighted television episodes generating a mass of content larger than “the combined catalogues of Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, and Amazon Prime.” For a $10 monthly subscription fee, users could watch shows on multiple devices and platforms within days of new episodes appearing on legitimate services and channels, authorities said. “The defendants ran a platform that automated the theft of TV shows and distributed the stolen content to subscribers,” said assistant director in charge David Sundberg of the FBI Washington Field Office, in a statement. The five are Kristopher Dallmann, Douglas Courson, Felipe Garcia, Jared Jaurequi, and Peter Huber. The indictment states that the cadre obtained content from pirate sites such as SickRage, (also known as SickChill), Sick Beard, SABnzbd, and TheTVDB and offered it up in one place to subscribers. At one point, Jetflicks claimed to have more than 37,000 paid users and 183,200 episodes of television. Authorities estimated the monetary harm to program owners to be in the millions. Like a legitimate business, Jetflicks eventually ran into problems, such as subscribers sharing logins and passwords, authorities alleged in the indictment. Officials also said the group tried to disguise the site as an entertainment service for aircraft flyers after it faced inbound demands to remove unlicensed content. “When complaints from copyright holders and problems with payment service providers threatened to topple the illicit multimillion-dollar enterprise, the defendants tried to disguise Jetflicks as an aviation entertainment company,” noted Sundberg. And much like in the legitimate business world, about seven years after Jetflicks started, one member of the group broke away to launch a new, competing endeavor, officials said. Darryl Julius Polo, aka djppimp, launched iStreamItAll, which allowed users to stream and download TV and movies, the indictment states. iStreamItAll (ISIA) subscription plans had a monthly fee of $19.99, plus quarterly, semi-annual, and yearly options. Similar to Jetflicks, ISIA did not have permission to provide content, officials said. Polo, a computer programmer, pleaded guilty in 2019 to one count of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement and one count of criminal copyright infringement. Polo was sentenced to 4.75 years in prison and ordered to pay $1 million. Jetflicks also had its own org structure, authorities alleged. Dallman ran operations while Courson and Jaurequi assisted with management involving strategic decisions, hiring, and dealing with vendors and payment processors. Programming and coding was handled by Dallman, Polo, and Huber, who wrote and revised computer scripts for the website and mobile applications. That group also handled web design, customer interface, and technical assistance, authorities said. In 2016, an undercover agent streamed an episode of the science fiction show The OA, which aired on Netflix, according to the indictment. The agent also downloaded two episodes of a dystopian series, 12 Monkeys, which caused the distribution of the episodes without permission from the copyright owner, authorities wrote. Courson, Garcia, Jaurequi, and Huber each face a maximum penalty of five years in prison, and Dallmann faces a maximum penalty of 48 years in prison, according to the DOJ. A sentencing date has not been set.",

                    "text": "Five men have been convicted of running a massive, unauthorized streaming service for more than a decade by a federal jury in Las Vegas. Kristopher Dallmann, Douglas Courson, Felipe Garcia, Jared Jaurequi and Peter Huber began operating an online streaming service, called Jetflicks, as early as 2007, according to court documents.The streaming service could be subscribed to and provide users with illegal copies of hundreds of thousands of copyrighted television episodes. The five men used \"sophisticated computer scripts and software to scour pirate websites\" for the copies, officials said in a news release.Jetflicks had a streaming catalog larger than that of Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Amazon Prime combined, authorities said. The service generated millions in subscription revenue, court documents said, with \"tens of thousands\" of people subscribing to the service every month. The \"illicit multimillion-dollar enterprise\" came to light when copyright holders complained and payment service providers reported problems, FBI Washington Field Office Assistant Director in Charge David Sundberg said in the news release. When the complaints threatened to expose the organization, Sundberg said, the five co-conspirators tried to disguise the illicit streaming service as an aviation entertainment company - which failed.\"FBI will indeed investigate those who illegally profit from the creative works of others,\" Sundberg said. A Las Vegas jury convicted each man of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement. Dallmann was also convicted of two counts of money laundering by concealment and three counts of misdemeanor criminal copyright infringement. Courson, Garcia, Jaurequi, and Huber each face up to five years in prison, according to the news release, while Dallman faces a maximum penalty of 48 years in prison.

                    "text": "The illegal streaming service Jetflicks once boasted on its website that visitors could watch just about any TV show or movie “Anytime. Anywhere.” Now the five people behind the bootleg streaming service are facing some serious jail time. A jury found Kristopher Dallman, Douglas Courson, Felipe Garcia, Jared Jaurequi and Peter Huber guilty in a Las Vegas federal court on Friday for conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement. Dallmann was also found guilty on two counts of money laundering and three counts of misdemeanor criminal copyright infringement for leading the Jetflicks operation, according to court documents and a US Department of Justice press release. Jetflicks used computer scripts and software to scour the internet for illegal copies of movies and television shows and posted hundreds of thousands of illegal copies as far back as 2007 from torrent and Usenet sites. The defendants created a catalog of bootleg shows and movies bigger than the combined collections of streaming services including Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Amazon Prime, according to the Department of Justice. Users could pay a subscription fee to access the site on pretty much any media streaming device with a web browser. Jetflicks claimed to “offer more than 183,200 television episodes and have more than 37,000 subscribers,” according to the initial indictment filed in the Eastern District of Virginia in 2019. Dallmann, the leader of the group, and his co-conspirators “made millions of dollars streaming and distributing this catalog of stolen content,” according to the press release. At one point, operators and employees of Jetflicks were making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year from its subscription service. Dallman wrote in an online chat that his site made $750,000 in one year, according to the indictment. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) took notice of Jetflicks in 2012 and sent cease and desist letters to the site’s operators. Four years later, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) started its undercover operation of the site by paying for a six-month subscription. Undercover agents recorded multiple instances of illegal uploads of shows like Shameless, Ray Donovan, The OA and SyFy’s 12 Monkeys alongside charges for accessing them. Then the agents traced those charges back to the defendants’ bank accounts, according to court records. A sentencing hearing has yet to be scheduled. The Department of Justice says Dallman could face up to 48 years in prison and the four remaining defendants could each face five years in prison.",

The Princess of Wales, 42, shared a sweet action shot of William jumping in the sand with the pair’s three children Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis. “Happy birthday Papa, we all love you so much! Cx,” she captioned the snap, shared on X. Elsewhere, King Charles also shared a special birthday tribute for his son. “Happy Birthday to The Prince of Wales! ?,” the monarch, 75, wrote on X alongside a photo of himself holding baby William. William’s birthday celebrations come just one day after he traveled to Germany to watch England’s national soccer team take on Denmark in the Euro 2024. The heir to the throne, who serves as the president of the Football Association, snapped a photo alongside Denmark’s King Frederik X ahead of the 1-1 draw on Thursday. “May the best team win ?????????⚽ #ENGDEN #EUROS2024,” William captioned the pic, shared on X. On Wednesday, William attended the Royal Ascot with several members of the royal family, including his cousins Zara Tindall, Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice. While Princess Catherine wasn’t at the event, her parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, were in attendance. The duo were seen chatting to William, and at one point, the Prince helped his 69-year-old mother-in-law when her heel got stuck in the grass. He helped her hand as she put her shoe back on, and they laughed about the snafu. This week’s events came hot on the heels of Saturday’s Trooping the Colour ceremony, which saw the Princess of Wales make her first public appearance since her cancer diagnosis. The mom of three, 42, delighted fans by appearing on the Buckingham Palace balcony alongside her husband and father-in-law King Charles to watch the traditional military flypast with her three children. After the Red Arrows shot past the palace, spraying the colors of the Union Jack flag behind them, Middleton and her family waved to the crowd below. William has faced a challenging 2024 so far after his wife and his father were diagnosed with cancer earlier this year. After taking some time away from public-facing duties to be with his cancer-stricken wife, William recently returned to the spotlight by taking on an extra workload.",

                    "text": "Kate Middleton publicly celebrated Prince William’s 42nd birthday with a playful new picture. On Friday, the Princess of Wales posted a photo of her husband jumping into the air during a beach trip with their three kids. The Prince of Wales wore a navy hoodie and pink board shorts in the sweet snap as he held hands with Princess Charlotte, 9, and Prince Louis, 6. Prince George, 10, made up the end of the chain, holding onto his younger brother. The photo was taken last month by Middleton in Norfolk, England, Kensington Palace confirmed to People. “Happy birthday Papa, we all love you so much! Cx,” Middleton, 42, gushed on her social media accounts. “? The Princess of Wales, 2024.” Her family members were all smiles in the social media upload, with their outfits noticeably differing from the similar shot she shared on Father’s Day over the weekend. That photo was also taken at the beach as William and his children stood with their arms around each other, backs to the camera. “We love you, Papa. Happy Father’s Day ? G, C & L,” she captioned the picture. ““? The Princess of Wales, 2024.” The royals have been having a rough year as Middleton was diagnosed with cancer following abdominal surgery in January. At the time, she stepped back from public duties — which led to rampant conspiracy theories about her absence. Middleton revealed her health struggles in March and explained her delay in sharing. “It has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them and to reassure them that I am going to be OK,” she said. Middleton made her first public appearance on Saturday for Trooping the Colour — and the outing took “a toll” on her, royal expert Katie Nicholl told Entertainment Tonight two days later. “The princess has this sort of swan-like quality about her,” she noted on Monday. “She’s sort of gliding on the surface, but beneath the water, I think often she’s paddling quite frantically.”",

As seen in a new Instagram post on Friday, June 21, the now-42-year-old Prince of Wales was seen holding hands with his and Kate’s children — Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis — while they jumped onto a beach together. “Happy birthday Papa, we all love you so much! Cx,” the caption read, while also giving photo credits to the Princess of Wales, 42. View this post on Instagram Last week, Kate shared a separate picture of her husband and their children to Instagram in honor of Father’s Day. Based on the image, it appeared to have been captured at the same beach. In the shot, William and their kids’ backs were turned toward the camera while looking out at the ocean. The royal family recently stepped out together for the annual Trooping of the Colour event. The celebration was Kate’s first major public outing since she underwent a planned abdominal surgery in January. In March, the Princess of Wales announced in a video message that she had been diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer. Less than three months later, Kate shared an update on her chemotherapy journey, noting that she has been “making good progress” but also pointing out that she has “good days and bad days.” “On those bad days, you feel weak, tired and you have to give in to your body resting,” she explained in her Instagram post last week, adding, “But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well.” Kate then revealed how much longer she will be undergoing chemotherapy. “My treatment is ongoing and will be for a few more months,” she continued. “On the days I feel well enough, it is a joy to engage with school life, spend personal time on the things that give me energy and positivity, as well as starting to do a little work from home.” Due to her current condition, Kate has not been able to tend to her public duties nor participate in other engagements. However, she is leaning “how to be patient, especially with uncertainty” when it comes to the future, the royal added in her caption.",

French Gates announced in May that she would be resigning as co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, almost three years after she and her ex-husband announced their separation. Her last day with the foundation was June 7. Per the terms of the Gateses' divorce agreement, French Gates departed the foundation with a $12.5 billion grant. Her net worth is estimated at more than $13 billion, according to Bloomberg. French Gates did not say in her endorsement on Thursday whether she plans to donate to Biden's campaign.",

                    "text": "Charli XCX surprise-released a remix of Brat‘s “Girl, So Confusing,” her song dedicated to Lorde, alongside the “Supercut” singer herself. Earlier on Thursday, Charli used the now-coined Brat wall to announce the collaboration, by having a pair of painters write Lorde’s name on a white wall. To say the least: the girls and gays were gagged. After the announcement, Charli posted a snippet from the song to her private 360_brat page, where Lorde can be heard singing, “Well honestly, I was speechless when I woke up to your voicemail when you told me how you’re feeling, let’s work it out on the remix.” On the original track, Charli sings about her overthinking, insecure tendencies around her “awkward,” frenemy relationship with a fellow singer, whom she doesn’t “have much in common” besides being two of the internet’s favorite artists. “People say we’re alike/They say we’ve got the same hair/We talk about making music/ But I don’t know if it’s honest,” sings Charli in the track’s pre-chorus before she repeats the refrain, “It’s so confusing, sometimes, to be a girl.” In the second verse of the song, Charli references Lorde’s “Team” lyric — “I’m kind of over gettin’ told to throw my hands up in the air” — and sings to Lorde, “You’re all about writing poems, but I’m about throwing parties/Think you should come to my party and put your hands up.” After listening to Brat, fans quickly learned the song’s lyrics were likely friendly after Lorde was spotted attending Charli’s album release party in New York City. Charli also remixed Lorde’s song “Green Light” during her Party Girl DJ event in Mexico City Wednesday night. The new track follows Charli’s release of a deluxe version of the album, titled Brat and it’s the same but there’s three more songs so it’s not, last Sunday. The new version of the LP included songs such as “Hello goodbye,” “Guess,” and “Spring breakers.” “On Brat, she stays out later and goes harder than ever before,” reads Rolling Stone’s review of the album. “And while she’s spinning around on the dance floor she’s also spiraling out in her head, digging deep into the types of insecurities and fears reserved for the comedown the morning after.”",

Well, that has now been pretty much confirmed with Lorde hopping on a new remix of the track. On the song (officially titled “The girl, so confusing version with lorde”), Lorde responds to the original lyrics, singing, “Well, honestly, I was speechless / When I woke up to your voice note / You told me how you’d been feeling / Let’s work it out on the remix.” In a May cover story with Rolling Stone UK, Lorde spoke about some envy she felt when Lorde first found fame, saying, “When ‘Royals’ came out, I was super jealous of the success that that song got, and that Ella got. You piece all this stuff together in your brain, like: ‘She was into my music. She had big hair; I had big hair. She wore black lipstick; I once wore black lipstick.’ You create these parallels and think, ‘Well, that could have been me.’ But it couldn’t have because we’re completely different people. I wasn’t making music that sounded anything like ‘Royals.’ I think you just read what you want into it because you’re feeling insecure about your own work.” Listen to the “Girl, So Confusing” remix above.",

After Charli sang about a tense, complicated friendship with a fellow pop star on her Brat album track \"Girl, so confusing,\" fans speculated she was talking about Lorde — and it seems like they were right. On June 21, the two musicians teamed up for a vulnerable remix of the song, titled \"The girl, so confusing version with lorde,\" on which they each unpack their feelings toward one another. The original song finds Charli, 31, wondering how another musician truly feels about her despite both of them claiming to be friends. \"Yeah, I don't know if you like me / Sometimes I think you might hate me / Sometimes I think I might hate you / Maybe you just wanna be me,\" she sings on the first verse. Throughout the track, released June 7 on Brat, the \"Von dutch\" performer addresses she and Lorde, 27, failing to follow through on hanging out and collaborating, as well as them garnering comparisons to one another for having \"the same hair.\" Lorde responds to Charli's thoughts on the remix, explaining that she didn't realize her actions made such an impact. \"Well, honestly, I was speechless / When I woke up to your voice note / You told me how you'd been feeling / Let's work it out on the remix,\" she sings. The \"Green Light\" performer admits to canceling on their plans in the past due to feeling \"so lost in my head\" and not wanting to take photos with Charli because she was dealing with body image issues at the time. \"'Cause for the last couple years / I've been at war with my body / I tried to starve myself thinner / And then I gained all the weight back,\" sings Lorde. \"I was trapped in the hatred / And your life seemed so awesome / I never thought for a second / My voice was in your head.\" Later in the Grammy winner's verse, she reflects on building defensive traits as a child and realizing they still impact her today — to the point where Charli feels rejected as a result. \"She believed my projection / And now I totally get it / Forgot that inside that icon / There's still a young girl from Essex,\" concludes Lorde's verse, before they duet the rest of the track. \"I ride for you, Charli,\" declares the \"Royals\" singer before the final chorus. Throughout their careers, Lorde and Charli have received comparisons — mainly for having similar looks and coming up in the industry around the same time. While they've praised each other's music in the past, Charli recently told Rolling Stone UK she was \"super jealous\" of Lorde's success with \"Royals\" in 2013. \"You piece all this stuff together in your brain, like: ‘She was into my music. She had big hair; I had big hair. She wore black lipstick; I once wore black lipstick,'\" she told the outlet. \"You create these parallels and think, ‘Well, that could have been me.’\" Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Upon the release of Brat earlier this month, Lorde praised the album in an Instagram Story post. \"Charli just cooked this one different,\" she wrote at the time. \"So much grit, grace and skin in the game. I speak for all of us when I say it’s an honour to be moved, changed and gagged by her work. There is NO ONE like this bitch,\" she added.",

                    "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Charli XCX Getty Images for Spotify Charli XCX’s new album Brat has gotten fans around the world dancing with her incomparable approach to hyperpop and electroclash. Shortly after its release, the British songstress expanded the Brat universe with the deluxe edition titled Brat and It's the Same But There's Three More Songs So It's Not. Now, one of the project’s most buzzed-about tracks has gotten a remix featuring the subject of the original song. Upon the album’s release, fans deduced that the song “Girl, So Confusing” was about Lorde—more specifically, Charli being compared to the New Zealand singer throughout her career and the insecurity she developed as a result. Charli herself reflected on their relationship in a recent interview with Rolling Stone UK. “When ‘Royals’ came out, I was super jealous of the success that that song got, and that [she] got,\" Charli said. \"You piece all this stuff together in your brain, like: ‘She was into my music. She had big hair; I had big hair. She wore black lipstick; I once wore black lipstick.’ You create these parallels and think, ‘Well, that could have been me.’ But it couldn’t have because we’re completely different people. I wasn’t making music that sounded anything like ‘Royals.’ I think you just read what you want into it because you’re feeling insecure about your own work.\" Charli and Lorde have been amicable in the time since then. “You get over it and then you try to figure out all the things that are unique about you and you pursue that, and then probably in five months’ time you have a breakdown about something else,” she said.

She confessed that she had no idea how Charli was affected by her success. “I was trapped in the hatred / And your life seemed so awesome / I never thought for a second / My voice was in your head,” she says. Lorde goes on to outline what she’s been dealing with in recent years, which include some difficult personal and physical battles. “For the last couple years / I've been at war with my body / I tried to starve myself thinner / And then I gained all the weight back,” she croons. The Brat rollout has been filled with surprise drops like these, and it’s entirely likely the “360” singer isn’t done yet. Considering her emotional attachment to the art, more releases shouldn’t come as a shock. “I was born to make dance music. I came from the clubs,” she stated plainly on social media of the project. “[Brat] is the album I’ve always wanted to make.”",

                    "title": "Count Ymir quest and steps in Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree",
                    "text": "The sorcerer Count Ymir is an NPC in Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC located in Manus Metyr cathedral. Not only will Ymir teach you unique sorceries, but he also has a big quest that will earn you special gear, exclusive spells, and a strong spirit summon. Ymir’s quest also includes in a major optional boss battle with a Boss Remembrance. Completing Ymir’s quest requires having access to much of Shadow of the Erdtree’s map, including the Hinterlands and Cerulean Coast area. You’ll also need to acquire at least one of two items — an Iris of Grace or Iris of Occultation — to receive certain rewards from Ymir’s servant, Jolán. In this Elden Ring guide, we’ll show you every step of Count Ymir’s quest, including whether you should use the Iris of Grace or Iris of Occultation. Here’s a list of all the steps you need to go through in order to complete Ymir’s quest. Manus Metyr cathedral can be accessed after defeating Rellana, Twin Moon Knight at Castle Ensis and entering Scadu Altus. Starting from the Highroad Cross Site of Grace, head north to the guide stele and acquire the Scadu Atlus Map Fragment. Further north, at the fork in the road, turn right and head southeast to head toward another site of grace at Moorth Ruins. At the southern end of the ruins, you’ll see a hole in the ground that leads to an underground cavern. You can safely jump down there using various ledges and rooftops, and take a tunnel pathway toward a new location, Bonny Village. From the Bonny Village site of grace, head east, over a small ravine and across two bridges, to reach another site of grace, Bridge Leading to the Village. From there, take the road north (past many wolves and a Furnace Golem) to yet another site of grace, Church District Highroad. The road then takes a southward turn, and terminates at Cathedral of Manus Metyr. Ymir will be quietly sitting on the throne in the apse of Manus Metyr. Speak to him, and he’ll give you the Hole-Laden Necklace item and Ruins Map that points toward your first destination: Finger Ruins of Rhia, west of Jagged Peak. When he’s not at his throne, Ymir can be found in a small graveyard connected to Manus Metyr. Speak to him there or at his throne to advance his dialogue and quest, resting at the cathedral’s site of grace to progress. Ymir will also teach you new glintstone sorceries. Check his stock to see if there’s anything new. Ymir’s first Ruins Map points you to Finger Ruins of Rhia, west of Jagged Peak. The Finger Ruins of Rhia location is accessible from the Finger Ruins of Rhia Site of Grace. To get there, head northeast from the Cerulean Coast Cross Site of Grace, riding along the coast westward until you reach a giant stone slab ramp, on the other side of which is the Finger Ruins of Rhia Site of Grace. Finger Ruins of Rhia is a massive crater filled with Fingercreepers and Snakemen. Near the northern end of the crater is a ritual site of four standing stones shaped like fingers, with a Hanging Bell at its center. Simply walk up to the bell, where you’ll be prompted to “Sound the hanging bell.” You’ll receive the Crimson Seed Talisman +1. Once completed, return to Ymir, who will give you another Ruins Map. Ruins Map (2nd) points you to Finger Ruins of Dheo, east of the Hinterland in Scaduview. The Hinterland and Scaduview are accessible through Shadow Keep. From the Shadow Keep, Back Gate Site of Grace, walk north, where you’ll see a side passage to the east that leads to a headless statue of Marika. At this altar, you’ll need to use the “O Mother” gesture to open a secret passageway leading to the Hinterland site of grace. From Hinterland, head east to the Fingerstone Hill Site of Grace, then southeast to another crater populated with Snakemen (including Snakemen who can paralyze you with a powerful spell). Near the southern end of the crater is a ritual site of four standing stones shaped like fingers, with a Hanging Bell at its center. Approach the bell, where you’ll be prompted to “Sound the hanging bell.” You’ll receive the Cerulean Seed Talisman +1. Once completed, return to Ymir, who will give you another Ruins Map. Ruins Map (3rd) points you to Finger Ruins of Miyr, which lies underneath Manus Metyr. To access this area, known as the Finger Birthing Grounds, Ymir cannot be on his throne. If he is, rest at a site of grace until he moves to the graveyard at Manus Metyr. Approach Ymir’s throne, which has a secret switch underneath its seat. Interact with it to open a secret passageway leading to Finger Birthing Grounds. One more Hanging Bell awaits, with a battle against the boss Metyr, the Mother of Fingers on the other side of it. However, as you enter the Finger Ruins of Miyr, you’ll be invaded by Swordhand of Night Anna. Defeat her, and you’ll be rewarded with a claw weapon, Claws of Night. Having vanquished Anna, you are now free to battle Metyr, the Mother of Fingers. Metyr, the Mother of Fingers is a Remembrance boss. You can cash in her Power of Remembrance with Finger Reader Enia at Roundtable Hold to receive either the Staff of the Great Beyond, a catalyst used for casting both sorceries and incantations; or the Gazing Finger, a club with a unique skill known as Kowtower’s Resentment, a charge attack that will cause an explosion. Once Metyr, the Mother of Fingers has been felled, return to Manus Metyr. If you’ve been conversing with the curt swordswoman Jolán, you’ll know by now she’s not a nice person. After defeating Metyr, the Mother of Fingers, return to Ymir’s throne to inspect it. You’ll immediately be invaded by Swordhand of Night Jolán. Kill the invader. After the battle with Jolan, Ymir will spawn at his throne and attack you, now as Count Ymir, Mother of Fingers. Kill him to receive the following items: Return to the cemetery to the west, where you’ll receive the Cherishing Fingers sorcery, one of the spells Ymir used during your fight against him. Jolán clings to life when you’ve spoken to her in Manus Metyr. Talk to her, and you’ll be presented with a choice, to use either an Iris of Grace or an Iris of Occultation to decide her final fate. There’s just one more task involving Jolán. If you chose the Iris of Grace option and have the Swordhand of Night Jolán Spirit Ashes, you should teleport back to the Hinterland Site of Grace in Scaduview, then head east to the Shaman Village. This quiet, flower-covered peak abuts Rabbath’s Rise in Scadu Atlus below. From the east corner of Shaman Village, you’ll need to jump down a handful of ledges, then jump to a balcony on Rabbath’s Rise, where you’ll find Anna’s puppet — the physical manifestation of Swordhand of Night Anna. Interact with Anna’s puppet and you’ll see the prompt “Usher Anna into Swordhand of Night Jolán’s spirit ashes?” Selecting “Yes” will transform the Swordhand of Night Jolán Spirit Ashes into the Jolán and Anna spirit ashes — meaning, you’ll summon two Swordhand of Night spirits when using the ash. You’ll also have the option to revert this Spirit Ashes upgrade, if you prefer. Looking for more Shadow of the Erdtree guides?

You’ll need to pick up the Storeroom Key and unlock the Storeroom door before you can meet her. After your first conversation, you can check in with her a couple more times after defeating the Divine Beast Dancing Lion and Messmer the Impaler. Our Elden Ring DLC guide will walk you through where to find Hornsent Grandam, and all the steps you’ll need to take to complete her questline. You’ll find Hornsent Grandam as you explore Belura. You’ll to meet her after you find the Storeroom Key. Use the Storeroom Key to unlock a door to the south of the Small Private Altar Site of Grace. Inside, you’ll meet Hornsent Grandam. There’s nothing to do with her yet, but she’s creatively insulting. After you defeat the Divine Beast Dancing Lion, you’ll get the (ridiculous) Divine Beast Head helmet. Head back to Hornsent Grandam and put on the helmet before you talk to her again. Importantly, you have to do this before defeating Messmer the Impaler at Shadow Keep. This time, she’ll have a lot of new dialogue for you and you’ll get the Watchful Spirit spell. Head back to the site of grace and then return again. This time, she’ll give you some Scorpion Stew. After Castle Ensis, you’ll meet Hornsent in his second location at the Highroad Cross Site of Grace. You can give him the Scorpion Stew for a little more dialogue (but it doesn’t seem to have any real effect). You might also notice that Hornsent Grandam asks you to take her son into battle with you — presumably Hornsent — but doing so doesn’t seem to affect her questline. Once you’ve defeated Messmer the Impaler at Shadow Keep, return to Hornsent Grandam again (with or without the helmet on). This time, you’ll get the Gourmet Scorpion Stew, which works as a healing item and restores your health over time. After that, she’ll doze off and you won’t get anything else out of her until after you’ve defeated the DLC’s final boss. Looking for more Shadow of the Erdtree guides?

When you pick it up, you’ll already be past where you need to use it, so it’s easy to miss the door it unlocks — and the NPC you’ll meet inside. Our Elden Ring DLC guide will walk you through where to find the Storeroom Key and the Storeroom, and what to do with the NPC inside, Hornsent Grandam. You’ll find the Storeroom Key as you explore Belurat. You’ll pick it up after you pass by the Storeroom — it’s near the Small Private Altar Site of Grace. From the Small Private Altar Site of Grace, head north and up the stairs. Take out the Horned Warrior, and then turn left. You’ll be at the top of the waterfall that falls down to the fountain square from earlier in your exploration. Stick to the right (north), to find an alley that leads around to the other side — watch for Shadow Undead as you go. Take a left at the river, and then head into the building on your right. Climb the ladder to find the Storeroom Key on a corpse at the top. Head back to the Small Private Altar Site of Grace. This time, when you leave, take a left (south) to cross the bridge those annoying casters snipe from. At the far end, you’ll use the Storeroom Key to unlock a door to meet Hornsent Grandam. There’s nothing to do with her yet, but she’s creatively insulting. Unlock the other door just to have more options — it’s not really a shortcut, but it does give you the drop on the Shadow Undead in that dead end. She’s got some rewards with you if you keep checking in with her at certain points. We’ll walk you through those steps in our Hornsent Grandam guide. Looking for more Shadow of the Erdtree guides?

                    "text": "Sir Ansbach is one of many NPCs in Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. You’ll meet him early on in your adventure — in Gravesite Plain — and if you follow his quest, he’ll be with you through the entire expansion. In this Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree guide, I’ll walk you through how to complete Sir Ansbach’s quest in the Shadow Realm of the Lands Between. Sir Ansbach is pretty tough to miss, as he’s standing by the giant Miquella Cross outside of Belurat, the first major dungeon you’re likely to encounter in Shadow of the Erdtree. As you’re riding up to the castle gates, keep left and look for a little bluff. Here you can formally meet Sir Ansbach — former servant to Lord Mohg — and Moore, the shopkeep at the Main Gate Cross Site of Grace. Talk to Ansbach to learn a bit more about him and his interests. He’ll tell you he’s researching Miquella’s Crosses, and ask you to visit them and report back any secret ones you find. This is an optional part of Sir Ansbach's quest, and plays a bit into the quest of another NPC, Hornsent. During the first half of the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, Hornsent will give you a map showing you the locations of a few hidden Miquella Crosses. If you find them, interact with them, and then speak to Sir Ansbach to get some additional lore. Whether you get the extra lore or not, once you’ve introduced yourself to Sir Ansbach you can progress through the main story until the great rune breaks outside of Shadow Keep. When you get close to the Shadow Keep dungeon in Scadu Atlus, you’ll get a notification that the great rune has broken. This is supposed to happen — you didn’t do anything wrong — and will progress all the various NPC quests throughout the world, including Ansbach’s. Return to Ansbach and talk to him until he starts repeating himself. If you rest, he’ll disappear. You’ll bump into Sir Ansbach again in Shadow Keep, on the first floor of the Specimen Storehouse area. To reach Ansbach’s research nook, head forward from the Storehouse, First Floor Site of Grace, past the great beast, up the stairs on your left, and then hang right past the first bookshelf. You’ll find him reading in the corner of a small room. Exhaust his dialogue once again before continuing your journey through the storehouse. To progress Sir Ansbach’s quest further, you’ll first need to find the Secret Rite Scroll. Thankfully, you’re already in the right spot to locate it: the Shadow Keep Specimen Storehouse. Make your way to the Storehouse, Fourth Floor Site of Grace. From the site of grace, turn left and follow the path past the burning boats and enemies. Take the next stairs up and move forward. To your left, you’ll find a staircase leading down, away from the main path. Take these stairs and take out the enemies on the landing below. Go inside the nearby doorway to find a small research library. Head toward the edge, but be careful not to fall. To your right, on a table, you’ll see a purple pillar of light. Interact with it to get the Secret Rite Scroll. With the Secret Rite Scroll in hand, head back to Sir Ansbach on the first floor. When you talk to him, you’ll get the option to hand it over. Do so and he’ll learn that Lord Mohg’s body has been stolen and Miquella has plans for it. Exhaust Ansbach’s dialogue before you continue to the next step. Now it’s time to help Redmane Freyja, another NPC who has her own quest. After the great rune breaks, you can talk to Freyja at the Three-Path Cross Site of Grace back in Gravesite Plain to send her to Shadow Keep. You’ll meet Freyja on the seventh floor of the Specimen Storehouse, just behind the site of grace. She’ll be ducked down by the fireplace looking through some objects and loudly grumbling to herself. If you talk to her, she’ll tell you she’s busy and then complain about not talking to Ansbach when she had the chance. Travel down to the first floor again and tell Ansbach about Freyja’s frustrations. Exhaust his dialogue and then go rest again. Return to Ansbach and he’ll hand you a letter meant for Freyja. (If he doesn’t give you the letter after you rest, talk to Freyja again before talking to Ansbach). Bring the letter to Freyja to progress her quest, then talk to her until you exhaust her dialogue. She’ll give you the Golden Lion Shield for your trouble. You should then return to Ansbach to tell him about Freyja’s reaction to his letter. Once you’ve done all of Ansbach’s quests in Shadow Keep, go visit Leda at the Highroad Cross Site of Grace, outside Castle Ensis. Speak to her a few times and she’ll eventually reveal that it’s time to hunt down our buddy Ansbach. Once she asks for your help, the quest will be in motion, so head back to Ansbach’s hideaway in Shadow Keep. When you arrive, Ansbach won’t be there. Instead, you’ll find a red summon marker and a gold summon marker. If you want to see the end of Ansbach’s quest, move past the red summon maker and interact with the gold one — “assist Sir Ansbach.” This will teleport you to an arena inside the Specimen Storehouse. Ansbach will be there with you, and Leda will appear as an Invader. Work together with Ansbach to defeat her. Once you return to your own world, Sir Ansbach will still be missing, but you’ll receive Ansbach’s Longbow and Leda’s Rune (worth 40,000 Runes). With Leda defeated and Ansbach defended, you’ve completed most of the missable steps in the Ansbach quest. Now you just need to progress the story to the end, where you’ll meet up with many of the game’s NPCs — including Ansbach — before Shadow of the Erdtree’s final boss.

                    "text": "By RIO YAMAT (Associated Press) LAS VEGAS (AP) — A strange monolith found jutting out of the rocks in a remote mountain range near Las Vegas has been taken down by authorities. Its discovery over the weekend, and quick removal, revived a pandemic-era mystery that captured the public’s imagination when similar objects began to appear around the world. How it got there is still a mystery. “It remains unknown how the item got to its location or who might be responsible,” Las Vegas police said Friday in a series of posts on X announcing the removal of the glimmering, 6-foot-4 rectangular prism. Its removal was quick, because it was illegally installed on federal land managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and because of concerns over public safety and the land, a wildlife refuge. Members of the police department’s search and rescue team had discovered the object over the weekend near Gass Peak, part of the vast Desert National Wildlife Refuge where bighorn sheep and desert tortoises can be found roaming. It was the latest discovery in a series of mysterious shiny columns popping up around the globe since at least 2020. In November of that year, a similar metal monolith was found deep in the Mars-like landscape of Utah’s red-rock desert. Then came sightings in Romania, central California and on the famed Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas. All of them disappeared as quickly as they popped up. The Utah structure, believed to be the first in the series, had been embedded in the rock in an area so remote that officials didn’t immediately reveal its location for fear of people getting lost or stranded while trying to find it. Las Vegas police said the same concerns led them to tear down the latest monolith on Thursday afternoon. The department said it is being stored “at an undisclosed location” while authorities try to figure out the best way to dispose or store the massive object made out of a reflective sheet of metal that was molded around the prism and secured with rebar and concrete. The otherworldly structure evokes the object that appears in the Stanley Kubrick movie “2001: A Space Odyssey.” The Desert National Wildlife Refuge, which was established to protect bighorn sheep and is home to rare plants, is the largest wildlife refuge outside of Alaska and can cover the state of Rhode Island twice. Christa Weise, the wildlife refuge’s acting manager, confirmed Friday in a brief phone call with The Associated Press that the object was torn down but declined to further comment.",

                    "text": "The first round of WNBA All-Star game fan votes are in, and they are led by Las Vegas Aces star A'ja Wilson and Indiana Fever rookie sensation Caitlin Clark. Wilson holds 217,773 votes to Clark's 216,427. Rounding out the top five is Fever second-year forward Aaliyah Boston (171,864), New York Liberty forward Breanna Stewart (151,984) and Dallas Wings guard Arike Ogunbowale (130,838). Wilson currently leads the WNBA in scoring with 27.9 points per game on 52.3% shooting from the field, 43.8% from three and 84.6% from the free-throw line. Clark has put up 16.3 points, 5.5 rebounds and 6.2 assists on .390/.328/.912 splits. Chicago Sky star rookie Angel Reese is seventh in the first wave of All-Star voting returns with 118,490 votes -- a mere 449 away from sixth place. She recently set a WNBA rookie record with her seventh consecutive double-double in the Sky's 83-72 win over Dallas. The top-ten list also features five members of the Team USA roster bound for the 2024 Paris Olympics -- Wilson, Stewart, Liberty guard Sabrina Ionescu, Aces guard Kelsey Plum, and Minnesota Lynx forward Napheesa Collier. The Women's National Team will also participate in All-Star weekend, facing Team WNBA in a star-studded matchup on July 20. The selection process for that game is a unique one. The top-ten vote getters will automatically qualify for the All-Star Game, and any top-ten members who are not part of Team USA will be assigned to Team WNBA. The rest of Team WNBA's roster will be selected by coaches, who will pick from a pool of the next 36 highest-voted players. Fans make up 50% of the All-Star game vote, while current WNBA players and a panel of writers and broadcasters make up 25% each. Voting runs through Saturday, June 29. Final results will be announced on Tuesday, July 2.",

                    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — A’ja Wilson leads Caitlin Clark by just over a thousand votes in early fan voting for the WNBA All-Star Game, the league announced Friday. Clark’s Indiana teammate Aliyah Boston is third, about 40,000 votes behind the leaders. Wilson is having an incredible season, averaging 27.9 points and 11.3 rebounds. She has 217,773 votes. Clark is right behind with 216,427. The Las Vegas Aces star received the most fan votes last season, but that total was only 95,860. New York’s Breanna Stewart is fourth and Dallas’ Arike Ogunbowale is fifth. Chicago’s Angel Reese is seventh in the voting and is the only other rookie in the top 10. Fellow first-year players Cameron Brink and Kate Martin were just outside the top 10 in 11th and 12th. Sabrina Ionescu of New York (sixth), Kelsey Plum of Las Vegas (eighth), Napheesa Collier of Minnesota (ninth) and Dearica Hamby of Los Angeles (10th) round out the first 10. The All-Star Game will be played on July 20 in Phoenix and will pit WNBA All-Stars against the U.S. Olympic team. All-Stars are picked by a combination of fan vote (50%), current WNBA players (25%) and media (25%). After voting closes, the top 10 vote-getters will be named as All-Star Game participants, with any players competing for the U.S. on the Olympic team staying on their team. The remainder of the WNBA team will be chosen by the league’s coaches from a pool of the next 36 highest vote-getters, which must include 15 post players and nine guards. Coaches aren’t allowed to vote for their own players. The final WNBA All-Star Game rosters will be announced on July 2. ___ AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",

                    "title": "How a German Olympian helped take on CrossFit to build Hyrox, the next-generation fitness race with 34,000% growth",
                    "text": "As the race progresses, the music fades while the claps and cheers get louder. The participants, now glistening in sweat, need all the motivation they can get. When you scan the room, you will see all kinds of people—first-time Hyrox entrants to chiseled athletes, Gen Zs to baby boomers. The crowds cheering people in a gigantic arena make the race experience equal parts “cool” and serious business. Hyrox’s ingredients might sound familiar to any other fitness fad: a test of stamina and physical endurance lasting hours, a ticking clock, and a clear finish line. Races aren’t new to sports—think Spartan Race and Tough Mudder, which have been around longer. Hyrox classifies itself as a fitness race different from its arch nemesis, CrossFit, a specific breed of training that’s technical and harder to master with Olympic weightlifting and gymnastic elements. But, more importantly, it sets itself apart from the marathons and sporting championships of the world by asking a simple enough question: If going to the gym is a sport, how can we make something more of it? “There was a void in the world of sports,” Moritz Fürste, the co-founder of Hyrox and three-time German Olympian in field hockey, told Fortune in an interview. “It’s like this missing piece of the fitness world where people, for whatever reason, go to the gym every day, but they never compete.” Seven years on, Hyrox’s reputation precedes it around the world. While its first iteration in 2017 saw a meager 618 participants, the race has grown exponentially since, with the 2023/24 season closing with over 210,000 participants across 30 cities. That’s despite a little blip called COVID-19 that kept people locked inside their homes for nearly two years. Hyrox keeps on growing. Fürste thinks what the race has achieved so far is just the tip of the iceberg as it continues to attract average gym-goers, accomplished athletes, and CrossFit enthusiasts alike, whether in Miami, Milan, or Melbourne. Leaping past the seatbacks Hyrox started with a stumble. It was about 10 years ago when Fürste and his business partner and Hyrox’s CEO Christian Toetzke first met. They were instrumental in Germany’s campaign to host the 2024 Olympics and Paralympic Games. Despite a persuasive pitch, Hamburg’s residents voted against hosting the games in a 2015 referendum. “We went from opening bottles of champagne to literally closing them again and giving them back to the supermarket,” Fürste said of the day they learned about the referendum. But if sport teaches you one thing, it’s to never stop at the first stumble. Fürste and Toetze, a sporting events veteran, continued discussing ways to collaborate. While looking for ideas, they came across a staggering statistic that most people identified working out at the gym as their “sport.” That left the duo with lingering questions—and a seed of an idea for what would later evolve into the Hyrox race we see today. “We were like, ‘Okay, interesting, but what the hell is your sport?’” Fürste said. “If you were to think [of] all the people that are officially a member in a gym, I think we’re talking about the biggest organized sport in the world.” Hyrox was born. Rising above Once they had whipped the Hyrox model into shape, the next challenge was convincing people that, unlike other sporting events, it was indeed accessible. It offers various “divisions” based on age and fitness level to encourage more participants. With a couple of hundred racers in the first year and single-digit thousands the following year, selling the idea of mass participation wasn’t easy. Soon after, the pandemic hit, quickly limiting the number of people seeking such events. But Fürste and others at the Hyrox team were determined to keep the brand on people’s minds—so they organized a race in Hamburg with several rounds of COVID-19 testing daily. “I think we spent $100,000 on this mid-pandemic, without any kind of global hope that it would ever be better,” Fürste said. While a little outlandish, those efforts paid off. In 2022, when the world began opening up, people seemed more motivated and willing to try new things, which Hyrox still felt like it was, at the time. Its participants and race locations began to grow steadily before outstripping the number of runners at the New York and London Marathons, which was around 50,000. Leveling up the race experience Helena Sharpe, a 44-year-old recruitment director at JP Morgan, had been on a path to transform her lifestyle for five years. In the process, she dabbled in strength training, high-intensity cardio workouts, and more. Last year, she set herself a goal to finish London’s Hyrox race in May 2024 to motivate herself to return to fitness following a shoulder surgery. And now, having experienced the race once, Sharpe says she’s sure she’ll do it once again. “I think just the atmosphere spurs you on,” Sharpe told Fortune, adding that it was like nothing she had done before. “Something about it… I didn’t feel too intimidated.” Because Hyrox races happen in indoor arenas, the group has a lot more freedom with the atmosphere it builds for its participants—whether that’s with its start tunnels, colorful lights, or motivational speeches. “We’re trying to create a setup that makes actual athletes out of participants,” Fürste said. He likened the race to iconic marathons like the one in New York, which is equally about the place and the race itself. And like CrossFit, Hyrox also emphasizes the community feeling to boost people’s motivation. While it’s like many things people have heard of or experienced before, Hyrox is also unlike them in critical ways. For instance, Fürste argues that most people try to run marathons as a bucket list item, while only a handful are repeat runners. But he wants Hyrox to be something people feel they can constantly improve in, as with any other sport. He also highlighted that, unlike other sports, Hyrox tries not to gate-keep its events to just the crème de la crème. The race’s structure also helps prevent injuries—a common concern with CrossFit—as it aims to use different body parts and muscle groups, Fürste says. But he thinks there’s more room to educate people to pace themselves and be more aware of their abilities when entering a Hyrox race. As Toetze told The New York Times in April, the models that marathons and CrossFit have established are still great benchmarks of success. The latter specifically aims to build overall physical fitness instead of just elevating one domain, as running or rowing might. Hyrox draws on some of these forms of exercise while still keeping it straightforward, which is why Fürste is confident that Hyrox will stand its own ground. The excitement for the race is palpable—in Birmingham, it sold out 16,000 tickets in just four minutes. The event is eyeing over 450,000 participants in its upcoming season, over double its participants this year, in addition to more race dates. While this level of growth may not last forever, Hyrox is undoubtedly here to stay, Fürste says. “I’m 100% convinced that the overall sport of fitness racing will, in 10 years, be as big as running globally,” Fürste said.",

Among the famous faces departing are 22 current and former secretaries of state. Most notable are former prime minister Theresa May, former deputy PM Dominic Raab and current levelling-up secretary Michael Gove among the Tories, while former Labour ministers Harriet Harman and Margaret Hodge are also not seeking re-election. They are joined by Ian Blackford, the former Westminster leader of the SNP, two current deputy speakers, Rosie Winterton and Eleanor Laing, and the chairs of 10 select committees. By far the highest number of MPs standing down are from the Conservative Party, with 78 heading for pastures new. While MPs retire for all sorts of reasons, \"the thought that their party could be heading for another historic drubbing and a long spell in opposition is sure to be playing on Tory minds\", said the BBC.

Sign up So who are the next generation of MPs that will shape the future of British politics? The Week takes a look at four of the brightest prospects. Darren Jones Keir Starmer's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury emerged as a rising star thanks to his role as chairman of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee. It was on TikTok primarily where footage of \"his pithy and often brutal grillings of evasive ministers and hapless executives\" went viral, said Jane Merrick on the i news site. Jones was elected to the Commons in 2017, when Jeremy Corbyn eliminated Theresa May’s majority, but \"he is no Corbynista\", said The Guardian. It was the policies of Tony Blair's 1997 Labour government that transformed his life, he told the paper. \"It should be, in my view, at the heart of our plan to transform the country, and at the heart of our political vision – but you would have to anchor it in people's concerns and experiences,\" he said. Now destined for a prominent role in a future Starmer cabinet, Jones has the opportunity to practise what he preached. Katie Lam A former adviser to Boris Johnson and Suella Braverman, Lam's selection for \"what is expected to be a safe constituency the Tories should win\" in Weald of Kent, said the Kent Messenger, underlines her future prospects. Lam was deputy chief of staff to Johnson in No. 10 and a vice-president at Goldman Sachs. Following in some illustrious footsteps she was also president of the Cambridge Union but is perhaps most well-known as an \"award-winning lyricist behind Broadway and West End shows\", said the Messenger. Lam penned the lyrics to a musical adaptation of \"The Railway Children\", so perhaps a role at the Department for Transport could be appropriate should Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives pull off an unlikely victory. Carla Denyer After 14 years, Caroline Lucas, the Green party’s sole MP, will stand down at the next election but ready to take her place in the party's somewhat limited limelight is Denyer. Looking to win the Labour seat of Bristol Central, Denyer served as a local councillor from 2015 to 2024. She was named by the Women's Engineering Society as one of the UK's top 50 women in engineering due to her work on the climate emergency motion and also featured in Bristol Live's Pink List of the most influential LGBT+ people in Bristol. \"Obviously, I'm not going to have the keys to Number 10,\" Denyer told Politico. \"But as we've already seen with Caroline Lucas in Westminster, having a Green in the room has allowed her to ask questions, put forward motions, put things on the agenda that were simply not on the agenda before,\" she said. \"That's what Greens can do.\" Zarah Sultana The Labour MP for Coventry South is the youngest Muslim MP ever elected in this country and carries the twin distinction of being the most followed British politician on TikTok and also the most abused online. She told Elle: \"I'm a woman, I'm young, I'm Muslim, I'm left wing. When people attack me, it's usually for one – or all – of those reasons.\" Since her election in 2019, Sultana has been praised for delivering \"speeches on issues that matter to her\", said the London Evening Standard. These include \"ending child hunger, stopping gas licences in favour of a Green New Deal, free healthcare, and providing better pay to rail workers to end strikes\". Sultana's left-wing credentials could be just the ticket for Starmer to prove Labour is a broad church when it comes to choosing a potential cabinet.

                    "text": "The line began forming early Tuesday morning in Racine, Wisconsin, the usual river of red hats, cargo shorts, canes, and conspiracy theories, except that here and there were the fresh faces that the old-timers needed most. “I was in fifth grade when Trump was elected,” Kylie Smith, 18, was saying, excited for her first rally. “I just remember my dad yelling, ‘Trump won! Trump won!’” “I just wanted to be here—it’s a learning experience,” her friend Libby Kramer, 20, was telling me, as an older man in an I’m Voting for the Felon T-shirt listened in. “Welcome to the party,” he said. “It’s so good to see you girls,” a white-haired woman wearing a Fuck Biden hat said. Nearly a decade into the “Make America great again” movement, what Donald Trump needs to return to the White House is new voters, and among the most promising are the youngest, most impressionable voters of all. They were in elementary school when Trump was first elected, and the machinations being deployed to sweep them into the fold are less about issues such as Gaza or the planet or student loans than lights, screens, music, and the emotional appeal of righteous belonging—which has always been necessary for building armies and social movements. That kind of production has remained the essence of Trump rallies such as the one in Racine. And it has been the year-round specialty of Turning Point USA, the right-wing youth organization whose recent “People’s Convention” in Detroit was a carnival of swirling lights and booming music, with sponsors including the Association of Mature American Citizens—the MAGA version of the AARP. That event drew a crowd of young attendees who cheered 70-year-old Steve Bannon as he yelled “Victory or death!,” and 78-year-old Trump as he spoke of “the largest deportation operation in American history,” and two young men in sunglasses who walked onstage and unfurled a red flag that read White Boy Summer, a white-supremacist slogan. Outside of such events, the task of introducing young people to the shame-free camaraderie of the MAGA movement has been up to social-media influencers, parents, and, as the election nears, long-timers at rallies such as the one in Racine, where an older woman scanned the faces up and down the line. “It’s so good to see all the young people here,” she said. Just ahead, the rally was setting up in a park along a harbor of Lake Michigan: the stage, the screens, the speakers, the huge American flag hanging limp from a crane. “I think we’re moving,” said a young man holding hands with his wife, both of them 21-year-olds for whom supporting Trump was a kind of rebellion. “I grew up in a Democratic household, but I’m an adult now and I have to think for myself,” the woman was saying as her husband pulled her ahead. “We’re against abortion; we’re against illegal immigration.” “We don’t support the culture Biden supports,” her husband said, and behind him, an older woman in the ubiquitous Fuck Biden T-shirt offered her solidarity: “And the economy has gone to hell—I’m scared for you young people.” Behind her, a man from the state GOP was handing out cards. “Join the Milwaukee GOP! We’re on Instagram! We’re on Twitter! The whole political world is coming to Milwaukee!” he was saying, referring to the Republican National Convention next month. Behind him, the line was getting longer. There were mothers who’d brought daughters, and fathers who’d brought sons. Joe Vacek smiled and nodded as his 18-year-old son, Chase, said, “I guess I was 12 when Trump was elected.” “Yep, we were at hockey practice,” his dad said. “I remember the TVs in the lobby and these big portraits kept coming up,” the son said, recalling how Trump’s image began to seep into his consciousness. “I guess I started paying closer attention in 2020, especially when people started talking about election integrity. I was like, What are they talking about?, and I started researching.” He glanced at his father. “You’re doing great,” Joe Vacek said. Behind them was 19-year-old Jordan Lazier, who’d come with his grandparents. He had decided that his first presidential vote would be for Trump. “I remember when he was elected, I just liked him,” he said, recalling how his mother felt similarly. “I just knew he was better than Hillary; I couldn’t tell you how.” “You’re a smart kid,” his grandmother said. “Don’t forget about the evil versus good.” “Good versus evil,” Jordan repeated, looking at her. “I know about satanic stuff most Democrats are into. Republicans talk about worshipping Jesus Christ, and Democrats worship the government.” “We listen to a lot of prophets, and we understand Bohemian Grove,” his grandmother said, referring to some bleak corner of the QAnon conspiracy. Behind her, a veteran rallygoer was explaining something called the Rattle Trap conspiracy to a newcomer who was saying, “There’s so much out there I don’t know about.” Behind them were Bob Harper, 18, and Katherine Hughes, 19, who figured her journey to this point had begun in fifth grade, when her teacher instructed the class to color the states on a U.S. map red and blue after Trump got elected in 2016. That was the first time she thought about people as red or blue, and the country as something other than united. And she wanted to feel united, which is how being here made her feel. “We can’t really talk about all this with many kids our age—they call you racist, homophobic,” Hughes said, referring to the mood on her community-college campus, where she said most students were liberal, and many were Muslim, and she felt ostracized. “I just feel we should really be one country instead of divided,” Harper said, and soon the line began moving faster. Music started blaring from the rally site. Someone from the pro-Trump Right Side Broadcasting Network began filming, and people chanted for the camera, “Trump! Trump! Trump!” Tyler Marquisse, 19, was getting excited. He had driven over from his hometown of Kenosha, where the formative experience of his young political life had come in the summer of 2020, when protests and riots had broken out after the police shooting of a Black man named Jacob Blake, and a young white man named Kyle Rittenhouse had shot and killed two protesters. Marquisse was 14 at the time, and his reaction had mostly been fear. He recalled his parents telling him there was a gun in the bedroom, and a gun in the kitchen. They told him, “If someone walks through that door, you protect yourself,” and he remembered Trump coming to Kenosha soon after that. “Trump protected us,” he said now, standing near the front of a line that stretched several blocks past tables piled with T-shirts depicting Trump as an Old West outlaw, as a mafioso-looking convict, and with two middle fingers held up to the world. Seeing all of this, Matt Lahee, 20, was not sure what to think yet. “I’m just curious mostly,” he said, standing in line with his younger brother and his friend, both of whom were wearing red MAGA hats. Lahee was not. He wasn’t sure whom he would vote for in November. He had come with his siblings because he was home from school in Vermont, and because he wanted to see for himself what Trump and his rallies were all about. What he remembered about growing up in an upper-middle-class Chicago suburb with Trump as president: bobblehead dolls of Trump and Hillary Clinton. Snapchat groups where kids took sides. A social-studies teacher who had a Trump T-shirt on the classroom wall. Another teacher who taught students about mass incarceration. Neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia. Having Latino friends. Running track, fishing, and doing what you do as a kid up until 2020, when everything was upended by the pandemic and the police killing of George Floyd and the protests he never joined, even though he remembered the video, and feeling very sad about what happened. “Hey, Matt?” his brother, Ryan, said now. “What was that thing you were saying in the car? About nostalgia?” “I was saying things seemed like they were going smoothly before COVID hit,” Lahee said. “But I don’t know if that’s just nostalgia, or if it was really better?” He wasn’t sure, and now the line was moving, and soon they were all inside. Their first Trump rally had soft green grass, and a view of Lake Michigan, and the smell of hot dogs and fries. A warm breeze was blowing, and the sun was out. “Isn’t it a great day to be at a Trump rally?” one of the warm-up speakers said. People milled around. A young couple talked about the possibility of Trump being assassinated. A young man with long black hair, a beard, and an ankle monitor stood alone for a while until several police officers approached and quietly escorted him away. The loudspeakers began blaring “Time in a Bottle,” and older people mouthed the words. Matt Lahee found a place toward the back of the crowd. He yawned. He sat on the grass through “Pinball Wizard” and a video of Elvis Presley, and when the crowd got restless and started chanting “We want Trump!,” he did not join in. When Trump arrived and “God Bless the U.S.A.” swelled and people hoisted their phones, Lahee folded his arms. He listened as Trump mocked his successor’s age, and the crowd chanted “Fuck Joe Biden,” and he did not join in. He listened as Trump talked about illegal immigrants and “all the killing you’re going to see unless you elect me.” And as the crowd chanted “Kick them out!” and “Do it! Do it!,” he did not join in, and instead listened. He listened to the whole hour-and-a-half speech, and when it was over and the Village People were blasting, he headed toward the exit, still unsure what all of this meant. “I don’t know,” Lahee said. “It was kind of dark.”",

                    "text": "Jason and Kylie Kelce are “Shaking It Off” in London! The former Philadelphia Eagles center, 36, and his wife, 32, were spotted by fans at night one of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour shows in London on June 21. The Kelces were seen wearing black shirts as they made their way into the VIP section at Wembley Stadium before the concert. Ross Travis, a close friend of Jason's brother Travis Kelce, was also spotted entering the VIP tent on Friday. Fans shared videos of Jason signing an Eagles jersey and a hat, and exchanging friendship bracelets. He was spotted with a full arm of bracelets soon after getting to their seats. While Travis has previously gone to Swift’s shows in South America, Australia, France and Missouri, this is the first time Jason and Kylie have publicly attended the record-breaking tour. The “Love Story” singer was last publicly seen with Jason and Kylie at the Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas while cheering on Travis for his back-to-back Super Bowl wins. The three were spotted in a stadium box alongside Swift’s pals Blake Lively and Ice Spice. The couple’s attendance at the Eras Tour comes a day after Jason and Travis appeared on a panel at Sport Beach 2024 in Cannes in support of their podcast “New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce.” At the event, Jason spoke about how the brothers have embraced Swifties as a new part of their fanbase and podcast's demographic. \"It's been fun for me, I have three little girls, so in some ways, the show and everything that's transpired over the past year, has given reasons for girls to get involved in a sport where previously there wasn't that much interest,\" Jason said at the panel. \"So all of a sudden, dads are hanging out with daughters and there's worlds colliding, and our show gets to be another place where worlds collide, and it's awesome.\" Travis first expressed interest in the “Cruel Summer” singer after attending her Eras Tour show at Missouri’s Arrowhead Stadium last July. He said on his New Heights podcast that he put his number on a friendship bracelet and had planned to give it to Swift after the show, but things didn’t go according to plan. “I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings. So I was a little butthurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her,” Travis joked on his podcast.

Swift and Travis later confirmed their relationship in September 2023, after the singer was spotted cheering on the Kansas City Chiefs at a home game. Swift is set to play two more shows in London this weekend before heading off to Dublin the following weekend for her next set of shows on the European leg of the tour. She will come back to Wembley Stadium Aug. 15 for five more show dates. Swift is estimated to have 700,000 fans in attendance across all eight shows.",

Before Taylor took the stage at Wembley Stadium, Travis, Jason and Kylie were seen entering the VIP section together. One lucky fan even got Jason to autograph their New Heights podcast hat. The Kelces' U.K. night out marks Jason and Kylie's first time seeing Taylor's Eras Tour since she and Travis began dating. But that doesn't mean the former Philadelphia Eagles player—who shares daughters Wyatt, 4, Elliotte, 3, and Bennett, 14 months, with Kylie—hasn't been staying updated on her concerts.

                    "text": "He’s back to making her feel “So High School.” Travis Kelce was spotted at Taylor Swift’s first London Eras Tour stop at the famed Wembley Stadium on Friday after not being publicly seen with the pop star since last month. Kelce, 34, was joined by his brother and sister-in-law, Jason and Kylie, who took in their first show of the world tour. The retired Eagles center was seen wearing a slew of friendship bracelets on his wrist as he graciously traded them with excited Swifties in the audience. Fans learned Jason, 36, might be attending the event earlier in the day after he was spotted taking photos with fans at a pub in London following a quick jaunt to the South of France for the Cannes Lions Festival. The Kansas City Chiefs star — who joined his brother at Cannes Lions to record their “New Heights” podcast — entered the venue after his brother and sister-in-law, but still managed to make it before the 34-year-old pop star hit the stage. Travis’ look-alike pal, Ross Travis, also made the trip across the pond to watch Swift do her thing. “We do have a lot of new football fans coming in,” Travis shared. “So not just talking football like we would in the locker room, trying to, like, necessarily dumb it down or make it more simple so that everybody can follow along and still enjoy the show.” Jason chimed in, adding that the podcast has brought together fathers and daughters as young girls want to “get involved in a sport where previously there wasn’t much interest.” Meanwhile, the last time Travis attended the international leg of Swift’s tour was May 12 in Paris. At the time, pals Gigi Hadid and Bradley Cooper joined the three-time Super Bowl winner as they showed their support for the pop icon. Following the concert, Swift and Travis headed south to Italy for a romantic getaway to Lake Como. They stayed at a $21,000-per-night villa and were spotted enjoying a romantic dinner and taking a private boat ride around town. The couple is approaching their one-year anniversary. They’ve been dating since last summer after the NFL star attempted – and failed – to give his girlfriend his phone number at her Eras Tour concert in Kansas City, Mo., in July 2023. They took their romance public in September 2023 as Swift attended her beau’s game against the Chicago Bears. Sources previously told Page Six the “Cruel Summer” singer and Travis plan to get engaged this summer.",

                    "text": "Darren Lewis, the Texas A&M star who broke Eric Dickerson's Southwest Conference rushing record before addiction derailed his football career and post-football life, died Thursday night from cancer. He was 55. Lewis, who was a star at Dallas' powerhouse Carter High School, was among the country's top prospects in 1987, often mentioned alongside Emmitt Smith. He rushed for 5,012 yards 1987-90, breaking Dickerson's mark (previously held by Earl Campbell) of 4,450 yards, before bowl statistics were included. He finished his career fifth on the NCAA career rushing list, behind Tony Dorsett, Charles White, Herschel Walker and Archie Griffin. A two-time All-American while in College Station, \"Tank,\" as he was known because of his punishing running style, is still 1,309 yards ahead of second place on the career rushing list at Texas A&M. But during the NFL draft process, Lewis said he was exposed to cocaine at parties, and by prospective agents, and was assured he would test clean. Instead, he was the only player who tested positive for cocaine at the combine, and his stock plummeted to the sixth round, where he was drafted by the Chicago Bears, who claimed they did not know of his negative test, and was sent to rehab. He started just five games among his 33 appearances in the NFL for the Bears, rushing for 431 yards in his career. He never failed a drug test, but he was arrested on domestic battery charges and released in 1993. Lewis did not attempt to continue playing and returned to Dallas to try to straighten out his life, but he continued to deal with addiction. He told Texas A&M's 12th Man Magazine he had lost all of his money and his house by 1995, then was arrested for the first time on shoplifting charges in 1998. He was arrested again in 2004, 2005 and 2006, landing in state prison on robbery charges, and was released in 2010. In 2014, he was sentenced to 27 years in prison for a string of armed robberies at hotels and convenience stores, including shooting a 7-Eleven cashier in the leg, which Lewis claimed was an accident. \"I was selfish. I just wanted what Darren Lewis wanted and I didn't think about the people I may be hurting,\" Lewis told the Bryan-College Station Eagle last week. \"It was all about what I wanted at that time.\" Lewis was imprisoned in Pollock, Louisiana, where he developed a mass on his shoulder that later ruptured and was determined to be metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, which begins as skin cancer and later spreads to organs. He was moved to a prison in North Carolina for medical care before being released last year as part of a compassionate release program. Lewis told the Eagle last week while he was in hospice care that he was grateful for the long sentence because it allowed him to turn his life around in prison. He said that he hoped his life would be a lesson to others. \"I encourage the young people to use me as an example,\" Lewis told the newspaper. \"Making the wrong choice could cost you your career, your life, your family and your friends. It doesn't cost you anything to make the right decisions, but make one wrong decision and it could cost you your life.\"",

                    "text": "Darren Lewis, who starred at running back at Texas A&M and later played three seasons in the NFL for the Bears, has died of cancer at 55 years old. Lewis rushed for 5,012 yards and 45 touchdowns at Texas A&M from 1987-90, breaking Eric Dickerson’s Southwest Conference total rushing yards record, which had stood at 4,450 yards. According to ESPN, when Lewis finished with the Aggies, only four college running backs had more yards — Tony Dorsett, Charles White, Herschel Walker and Archie Griffin. Lewis was selected by the Bears in the sixth round of the 1991 NFL Draft. He played for the team for three seasons, the most notable coming in 1992, when he started five games, carrying the ball 90 times for 382 yards and four touchdowns, with an additional 18 catches for 175 yards. Lewis left football after the 1993 season, following a domestic battery arrest, and fell into a life of addiction and crime. In 2014, Lewis pled guilty in a string of armed robberies in the Dallas area and was sentenced to 27 years in federal prison. In one of the robberies, Lewis shot a 7/11 clerk in the thigh; he later told the Dallas Morning News that it was by accident. As he was dying in prison, Lewis granted a recent interview to the Bryan-College Station Eagle, via questions submitted to his wife, Tammie Thibodeaux. “I was selfish; I just wanted what Darren Lewis wanted and didn’t think about the people I may be hurting,” Lewis told the outlet. “It was all about what I wanted at that time.” He said he found reform in prison through religion and the support of his family. “Prison changed me in many ways,” Lewis said. “Prison actually saved my life. Prison changed the way I looked at things. Prison changed the way I approach things. Prison gave me the opportunity to sit down and study God’s word so that God could minister to me with his word.” Lewis added, “My wife Tammie, who has always been there for me no matter how low I was sinking, never left me. I also relied on my family.” Lewis was suffering from Stage IV metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, a rare form of skin cancer that can spread to other parts of the body. “When I was in prison I learned how to totally depend on God,” Lewis told the Eagle. “I allowed him to comfort me through his word. I would have been so lost and depressed if I had not gave my life over to Christ.”",

The Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), which represents about 28,000 American Airlines flight attendants, said it has moved closer to a strike as the airline did not present a favorable agreement. The airline’s flight attendants, however, cannot walk off the job until the National Mediation Board (NMB) grants them permission. The board will first have to determine that both the parties are at an impasse and further bargaining would not be productive. This lengthy and complex process makes it rather difficult for airline workers to strike. Last year, the NMB denied a request from the union to be released from federal mediation. American Airlines in an emailed statement to Reuters on Thursday said it will continue to negotiate with the union so that its flight attendants benefit from the contract. “This agreement is within reach and we look forward to additional dates being scheduled,” the airline spokesperson said. The current round of negotiations started in January 2020, but was paused at the height of the pandemic. Talks resumed in June 2021. Earlier this month, the airline had offered its flights attendants immediate wage increases of 17% in their new contract, which was later unanimously rejected by the APFA.",

This process, known for its complexity and duration, is expected to cause challenges for airline workers seeking to strike.Last year, the NMB rejected the union's request to exit federal mediation.Following the breakdown in recent talks, the union told its members in an email: \"We do not believe further negotiations will be scheduled prior to the National Mediation Board determining to release the parties into a thirty-day cooling-off period.

Union officials claim that flight attendants have faced significant challenges since the pandemic, including dealing with unruly passengers who resisted mask mandates on planes.Meanwhile, American Airlines expressed optimism that further negotiations with the APFA would soon be scheduled by the NMB, indicating that a deal is \"within reach.\"In a statement, the airline highlighted recent progress in the talks: \"We made good progress in negotiations this week, adding even more to the industry-leading proposal we've had on the table for months.\"We look forward to continuing negotiations so our flight attendants can benefit from the contract they deserve.\"The current round of negotiations between the union and American Airlines started in January 2020, but it was paused at the height of the pandemic.

The lack of a deal could impact up to 28,000 flight attendants. “After years of bargaining, including almost a year of mediated talks with the assistance of the National Mediation Board, and despite the Union’s best efforts, American Airlines did not come to the table with an agreement that adequately compensates American’s 28,000 Flight Attendants,” said APFA National President Julie Hedrick in a statement. “Flight Attendants will move the process forward to secure overdue economic improvements.” While the union is threatening a strike and already picketing at some airports, flight attendants will not be permitted to walk off the job until the National Mediation Board gives them permission to do so. It will only do that if it feels the parties are at an impasse and further negotiating sessions would make no sense. Even if it releases the union from mediation, there’s a 30-day cooling off period. If no deal is struck in that time, the union could strike. At present there’s no indication the board is preparing to release the parties from mediation. American has offered its flight attendants an immediate wage increase of 17%, but the union has rejected that offer. Negotiations between the two parties got underway in January 2020, then resumed in June 2021 after they were paused during the pandemic. American Airlines, in a statement, said it expects a deal to be reached. “This agreement is within reach and we look forward to additional dates being scheduled,” the carrier said.",

                    "text": "A union representing flight attendants for American Airlines Group said on Thursday that the latest round of talks with the carrier did not lead to an agreement this week. The Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), which represents about 28,000 American Airlines flight attendants, said it has moved closer to a strike as the airline did not present a favorable agreement. The airline’s flight attendants, however, cannot walk off the job until the National Mediation Board (NMB) grants them permission. The board will first have to determine that both the parties are at an impasse and further bargaining would not be productive. This lengthy and complex process makes it rather difficult for airline workers to strike. Last year, the NMB denied a request from the union to be released from federal mediation. American Airlines in an emailed statement to Reuters on Thursday said it will continue to negotiate with the union so that its flight attendants benefit from the contract. “This agreement is within reach and we look forward to additional dates being scheduled,” the airline spokesperson said. The current round of negotiations started in January 2020, but was paused at the height of the pandemic. Talks resumed in June 2021. Earlier this month, the airline had offered its flights attendants immediate wage increases of 17% in their new contract, which was later unanimously rejected by the APFA.",

                    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — South Carolina will hold runoff elections on Tuesday to decide a handful of races in which no candidate received a majority of the vote in the primary held just two weeks earlier. In the 3rd Congressional District, a candidate backed by former President Donald Trump faces off against the preferred candidate of Republican Gov. Henry McMaster in a contest that will likely determine who will succeed retiring GOP U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan. Voters in the June 11 primary winnowed the crowded Republican field down to pastor Mark Burns and nurse practitioner Sheryl Biggs. Burns has Trump’s endorsement and was the top vote-getter in the primary, with about 33% of the vote. Biggs placed second with about 29%. Biggs has McMasters’ backing while also prominently featuring photos of herself with Trump on her campaign website. Biggs slightly outraised Burns for the cycle, but Burns had almost triple the campaign cash Biggs had available heading into the primary. The winner will face Democratic nominee Byron Best, the manager of a paint store in Greenwood. Both Burns and Biggs would be heavily favored in November in the safe Republican district. Trump won the area with 68% of the vote in 2020 and 67% in 2016. Duncan ran unopposed in 2022. Also on Tuesday’s ballot are eight state Senate and four state House runoffs. All 170 state legislative seats are up for election in November. Republicans enjoy lopsided majorities in both chambers. Here’s a look at what to expect on Tuesday: PRIMARY RUNOFF ELECTION DAY South Carolina’s primary runoff election will be held Tuesday. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET. WHAT’S ON THE BALLOT The Associated Press will provide vote results and declare winners in 13 runoff elections, including one U.S. House, eight state Senate and four state House contests. WHO GETS TO VOTE Registered voters may participate in a partisan primary runoff election if they voted in the same party’s primary on June 11 or if they did not vote in the primary. In other words, Republican primary voters can’t vote in a Democratic runoff or vice versa. DECISION NOTES The 3rd Congressional District covers part or all of 11 counties, of which Anderson and Pickens tend to contribute the most votes. Trump carried both counties in the presidential primary with 69% and 68% of the vote, respectively. In the competitive 2018 Republican primary for governor, McMaster narrowly lost to Pickens but won a plurality of the vote in Anderson. He also won five of the counties in the southern half of the district by double-digit margins. The AP does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why. In South Carolina, recounts are automatic if the margin between the winning and losing candidates is not more than 1% of the total vote. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome. WHAT DO TURNOUT AND ADVANCE VOTE LOOK LIKE? As of June 5, there were about 3.3 million registered voters in South Carolina. The state does not register voters by party. In the June 11 primary, turnout was 14% of registered voters. About 32% of votes were cast before primary day, according to data from the South Carolina Election Commission. As of the second day of early voting on Thursday, a total of 7,850 ballots had been cast ballots before primary runoff day, almost all of them through in-person early voting. HOW LONG DOES VOTE-COUNTING USUALLY TAKE? In the June 11 primary, the AP first reported results at 7:18 p.m. ET, or 18 minutes after polls closed. The election night tabulation ended at 10:53 p.m. ET with 99.9% of total votes counted. ARE WE THERE YET? As of Tuesday, there will be 133 days until the November general election. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.",

                    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Tensions within the Democratic Party about President Joe Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war are playing out in a key New York primary race on Tuesday. Rep. Jamaal Bowman faces Westchester County Executive George Latimer in Tuesday’s highly contentious Democratic primary in New York’s 16th Congressional District. This is a safe Democratic district, but it encapsulates the fissures that have emerged within the party. The race headlines a ballot that includes six primaries for the U.S. House, plus races for state Senate, state Assembly and county district attorney. The ugly primary in the 16th District has exposed the party’s deep divide over U.S. policy on Israel, with current and former members of the New York congressional delegation sniping at each other and both candidates here seeking to paint the other as out of touch with and unfit for the district. Bowman, allied with the progressive group of representatives known as the “squad,” represents the left’s opposition to Israel’s conduct during the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and to the Biden administration’s support for Israel. Latimer is running on a more centrist, establishment position: His platform affirms Israel’s “rights of existence, stability, self-defense, and peace.” The race has already seen eyebrow-raising spending in New York City’s expensive media market. The two candidates have spent $3.2 million apiece in the race, according to campaign finance filings. Outside spending has injected an additional $14.4 million into the district, with the United Democracy Project -- the super PAC associated with the pro-Israel American Israel Public Affairs Committee -- leading these groups with $11.5 million in support of Latimer. Bowman has been endorsed by his fellow members of the “squad” and Democratic House leadership. Latimer has been endorsed by former Democratic presidential nominee and Westchester resident Hillary Clinton (though she lives in Chappaqua, which falls in the 17th District), local mayors and council members, and multiple Westchester County legislators. The winner of the Democratic primary of the 16th congressional district is favored to win the seat in November. In the 1st Congressional District, Democrats Nancy Goroff and John Avlon are competing for the nomination to face Republican Rep. Nick LaLota, who represents a district that Biden narrowly carried in 2020. Goroff previously led the chemistry department and taught at Stony Brook University. In 2020, Goroff was the Democratic nominee and lost to Republican Lee Zeldin. Avlon is a former CNN anchor who helped create No Labels, a centrist political group. Goroff boosted her fundraising advantage with a $1.2 million personal loan to her campaign. As of their latest filings, Goroff’s campaign had spent $1.7 million on the race while Avlon’s campaign had spent $1.2 million. However, a PAC backing Avlon is spending $1.4 million on the race, according to data from AdImpact. In the 22nd Congressional District, based in Syracuse, Democratic voters will choose between Air Force Veteran Sarah Klee Hood and former public school teacher John Mannion. Klee Hood leads in fundraising and has backing from VoteVets, a progressive group that supports veterans running for office. Mannion represents part of the district – stretching from Syracuse suburbs to Lake Ontario – in the state Senate. Several Democratic House incumbents are facing under-funded primary challengers in races that are not expected to be competitive. Rep. Claudia Tenney is the only House Republican facing a challenge in Tuesday’s primary, though her challenger, Mike Fratto, trails in fundraising, too. Albany County District Attorney David Soares faces a rematch of his 2012 race against attorney Lee Kindlon. Soares is running on a tough-on-crime message, while Kindlon, an attorney, accuses the incumbent of financial scandals. Kindlon is spending roughly $9,300 on advertising in the primary, according to data from AdImpact, while Soares is spending $4,000. Soares first won the Albany County District Attorney seat in 2004, and won his last primary election in 2020 with 56%, or 18,674 votes. Here’s a look at what to expect on Tuesday: PRIMARY DAY The primary will be held on Tuesday. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET. WHAT’S ON THE BALLOT The Associated Press will provide coverage for 46 contested races, including U.S. House, state legislature, and county district attorney. WHO GETS TO VOTE New York has a closed primary system, which means that only voters registered with a political party may participate in that party’s primary. DECISION NOTES The 16th District includes parts of two counties: northern reaches in Bronx County and southern Westchester County. After redistricting, around 90% of the district’s residents live in Westchester. These district lines work in favor of Latimer, who has spent more than three decades in state and local government in Westchester. Bowman, who has represented this district since 2021, was elected from a version of this district that included a much larger piece of the Bronx. Latimer and Bowman have tried to pitch themselves to two different pieces of the Democratic Party base. Bowman has emphasized his support among working-class people of color, who tend to live in denser parts of the district closer to New York City, such as the Bronx, Yonkers (where his campaign is headquartered), Port Chester and Mount Vernon. Latimer, who hails from Rye, has sought to forge connections among suburban voters and the district’s Jewish electorate. One of the key factors in the primary will be turnout in the Bronx and Yonkers, where Bowman is likely to perform better than in Westchester. One area to look at is Co-Op City, which has more than 47,000 residents and is the largest housing cooperative in the United States. Latimer’s path to victory runs along the New Haven and Harlem Metro-North train lines, which pass through wealthy suburbs like Pelham Manor, Scarsdale, Larchmont and Rye, among others. New York is not particularly fast at counting its votes. Additionally, mail ballots can arrive up to a week after election day, provided they are postmarked by election day. Late-arriving ballots could delay a race in a close contest. The AP does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why. In New York, recounts are automatic if the margin between the winning and losing candidates is within 20 votes or not more than 0.5% of the total vote. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome. WHAT DO TURNOUT AND ADVANCE VOTE LOOK LIKE? As of Feb. 27, there were 13,108,347 registered voters in New York. Of those, 49% were Democrats and 22% were Republicans. In the 2022 race for governor, turnout was 7% of registered voters in the Democratic primary and 3% in the Republican primary. About 20% of votes in that election were cast before Election Day. As of June 18, a total of 44,204 ballots had been cast. HOW LONG DOES VOTE-COUNTING USUALLY TAKE? In the 2022 Republican primary election, the AP first reported results at 9: 04 p.m. ET, or four minutes after polls closed. The election night tabulation ended at 2:51 a.m. ET with about 96% of total votes counted.",

                    "title": "What to expect in Utah's state primaries",
                    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Anti-Trump Republicans lost their standard-bearer in the Senate when Sen. Mitt Romney announced he wouldn’t seek a second term. On Tuesday, Utah voters will decide whether a similar brand of politics can still succeed in Republican primaries. Even before Romney announced he wouldn’t run again, former state House Speaker Brad Wilson had already formed an exploratory committee and Riverton Mayor Trent Staggs joined the primary. Both highlighted their support for former President Donald Trump. U.S. Rep. John Curtis has also entered the race and is widely seen as the candidate best positioned to win the crowded primary. Primary voters in Utah will also choose candidates for governor, the U.S. House and state legislature. Curtis leads in most of the public polling for the Senate race, but Staggs has the backing of Trump and the state Republican Party, after winning the most votes at the state convention. Wilson has a financial advantage, having loaned his campaign $3 million. Jason Walton, who’s pitching himself as a businessman in the style of Trump, is also running. Curtis has reiterated that he would vote for the Republican former president, but his primary opponents have criticized him for a lukewarm embrace of Trump. But while vying for Trump’s support is key in red districts and states, Utah is different. The most conservative candidates, while embraced by the state party, are often snubbed by voters. Winning a Utah nominating convention means that a candidate’s name will appear on the primary ballot, but candidates can also submit signatures to appear on the ballot. While the nominating convention traditionally rewards the most loyal members of the party, it doesn’t have a strong record of selecting the eventual nominee. In 2018, Romney lost the state convention to state Sen. Mike Kennedy. In the primary, however, Romney defeated Kennedy by more than 40 percentage points. Gov. Spencer Cox, who is running for another term, was booed at this year’s nominating convention. The state party endorsed Phil Lyman, who has supported Trump’s false claims of election fraud in his 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. However, while Cox may have been considered too moderate for the state delegates, he is still favored to win the primary on Tuesday. An exception to that rule was Rep. Celeste Maloy, who won the primary for a special election last year after placing first at the nominating convention. That victory, which was an upset, turned the little-known congressional staffer into the front-runner for the nomination. In November, she was sworn into the House. However, in her race for a full term this year, Maloy lost the nominating convention to Colby Jenkins, who has the backing of Sen. Mike Lee. Still, Maloy has a major fundraising advantage and an endorsement from Trump. Trump has not endorsed a candidate in Curtis’ open seat in the 3rd Congressional District. Kennedy, who lost to Romney in 2018, won the state party’s endorsement at the April convention. He faces state Auditor John Dougall, Roosevelt Mayor JR Bird, trampoline park empire owner Case Lawrence, and attorney Stewart Peay, who is backed by his wife’s uncle, Romney. Here’s a look at what to expect on Tuesday: PRIMARY DAY The primary will be held on Tuesday. Polls close at 8 p.m. local time, or 10 p.m. ET. WHAT’S ON THE BALLOT The Associated Press will provide coverage for 34 elections, including primaries for governor, U.S. Senate, U.S. House, state attorney general, state auditor, state Senate, state House, and state Board of Education. WHO GETS TO VOTE In Utah, political parties choose what kind of primary to hold. For Tuesday’s state primaries, the Democratic primary is open to all voters, while the Republican primary is open only to registered Republican voters. DECISION NOTES The 3rd Congressional District covers the eastern part of the state, stretching from Park City’s winter resorts, south to Provo and southeast to Moab. Kennedy represents a district in the state Senate that’s based in Alpine, between Salt Lake City and Provo. Bird is running as the candidate who represents rural voters. He is mayor of Roosevelt, a town in Duchesne County in northeast Utah. Wilson’s former state legislative district was in Davis County, northwest of Salt Lake City. The AP does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why. There is no automatic recount provision in Utah, though the state will pay for a candidate-requested recount if the margin between the top two candidates is 0.25 percentage points or less. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome. WHAT DO TURNOUT AND ADVANCE VOTE LOOK LIKE? As of June 13, there were 1,969,880 registered voters in Utah. Of those, 14% were Democrats and 50% were Republicans. In the 2022 U.S. Senate race, turnout was 22% of about 1.9 million registered voters in the Republican primary. In the 3rd Congressional District, turnout was 29% of roughly 113,000 voters in the 2022 Republican primary. Utah conducts its elections entirely through mail ballots. As of June 20, a total of 180,599 voters had cast ballots before Election Day, about 12% in the Democratic primary and 87% in the Republican primary. HOW LONG DOES VOTE-COUNTING USUALLY TAKE? In the 2022 Republican Senate primary election, the AP first reported results at 10:03 p.m. ET, or three minutes after polls closed. The election night tabulation ended at 1:46 a.m. ET with about 83% of total votes counted. ARE WE THERE YET? As of Tuesday, there will be 133 days until the November general election. ___ Associated Press writer Hannah Schoenbaum in Salt Lake City contributed to this report. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.",

                    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Colorado’s congressional delegation faces a reshuffling in Tuesday’s state primaries after a retirement, a resignation and a relocation have ensured that at least a third of the state’s population will have new representation in Washington next year. Tuesday’s primaries will also lay the groundwork for a general election in which two competitive Colorado districts could help determine control of the narrowly divided U.S. House in November. In the 3rd Congressional District, two-term Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert faced a tough rematch with Democrat Adam Frisch, who came within 546 votes of toppling the congresswoman in 2022. However, when fellow Republican Ken Buck decided in 2023 not to seek a sixth term in the neighboring 4th Congressional District, Boebert opted instead to head east and run for Buck’s open seat, where Republicans enjoy a bigger electoral advantage. She now faces a crowded Republican primary field that includes state Reps. Mike Lynch and Richard Holtorf, conservative activist and talk radio host Deborah Flora, Logan County Commissioner and former state Senate President Pro Tempore Jerry Sonnenberg and banking executive Peter Yu. Running for the Democratic nomination are speechwriter Trisha Calvarese, Marine Corps veteran Ike McCorkle and engineer John Padora. Buck resigned from his seat in March, triggering a special general election to serve out the remaining six months of his term. The race appears on the ballot alongside the regularly scheduled primaries for the full term. Several of the candidates vying for the full-term seat also sought the Republican nomination to fill Buck’s vacancy, but a state Republican Party committee nominated former Parker Mayor Greg Lopez, who is not running for a full term. He will face Democrat Calvarese and two third-party candidates. Since her election in 2020, Boebert has become a polarizing figure for her combative style and penchant for controversy. The past year has been particularly chaotic for Boebert’s personal life, with a messy divorce, the arrest of her son in a series of break-ins and thefts, a health scare requiring surgery for a blood clot and her highly publicized ejection from a Denver theater for causing a disturbance. Despite the controversies, Boebert likely improved her chances at reelection with the move to a district that former President Donald Trump carried twice with almost 60% of the vote. She leads the field in fundraising and has the backing of Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson and the state party. Back in Boebert’s former district, Frisch is unopposed for the Democratic nomination. He will face the winner of a crowded Republican primary field, which includes former state Rep. Ron Hanks, the state party’s preferred candidate. Although Frisch came close to beating Boebert in 2022, the district still leans Republican. Voters there gave Trump 53% of the vote in 2016 and 2020. Colorado’s most competitive U.S. House race this fall will likely be in the 8th Congressional District, where first-term U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo is unopposed in the Democratic primary. Her Republican opponent will be either state Rep. Gabe Evans or former state Rep. Janak Joshi. Evans is an Army veteran and former police officer, while Joshi is a retired physician and has the state party’s endorsement. Caraveo won her seat in 2022 with just 48% of the vote in this new district near Denver, Boulder and Fort Collins. Trump received 46% of the vote in the area in the last two presidential elections, enough to outperform Hillary Clinton in 2016 but about 4 percentage points shy of Joe Biden in 2020. In the 5th Congressional District, Republican U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn’s upcoming retirement after nine terms has created an opening for this Republican-friendly seat anchored by Colorado Springs. Political consultant and talk radio host Jeff Crank and state party chairman Dave Williams are running for the Republican nomination. Williams has Trump’s endorsement as well as that of the state party he runs. Some Republicans including Crank have criticized Williams for using the state party apparatus to promote his own congressional aspirations. The Democratic nominee will be either River Gassen or Joe Reagan. Trump received 53% of the District’s vote in 2020 and 56% in 2016. Lamborn received 56% in his 2022 reelection. Farther down the ballot are contested primaries for state Senate and state House. About half of the state’s 35 state Senate seats and all 65 state House seats are up for election this year. Democrats enjoy about a 2-to-1 majority in both chambers. Here’s a look at what to expect on Tuesday: PRIMARY DAY The Colorado state primary will be held Tuesday. Polls close at 9 p.m. ET. WHAT’S ON THE BALLOT The Associated Press will provide vote results and declare winners in 35 contests, including six contested primaries for the U.S. House, seven for the state Senate, 18 for the state House, two state boards of education, one for the University of Colorado Board of Regents and one special general election for the 4th Congressional District. WHO GETS TO VOTE Registered party members may vote only in their own party’s primary. In other words, Democrats can’t vote in the Republican primary or vice versa. Independent or unaffiliated voters may participate in any party’s primary. DECISION NOTES By running for a different seat, Boebert exchanged Colorado’s sprawling westernmost district for its sprawling easternmost district. In the 3rd District, the most influential counties in elections are Republican-friendly Mesa to the west, which includes Grand Junction, and Democratic-friendly Pueblo to the east. The candidate who carries both counties, as Boebert did in the 2020 primary when she unseated incumbent GOP Rep. Scott Tipton, would be difficult to defeat. In Boebert’s new 4th District, the key county to win is Douglas, nestled between Denver and Colorado Springs. Douglas has by far the largest population in the district, casting more than half of the votes in Buck’s 2022 reelection. A candidate trailing in Douglas would need overwhelming margins in the rest of the District to eke out a win. Douglas votes less Republican than the rest of the District, giving Trump about 52% of its vote in 2020, compared to about 60% to nearly 90% in other counties. The AP does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why. Colorado allows for automatic recounts in races where the vote margin is 0.5% or less of the leader’s vote total. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome. WHAT DO TURNOUT AND ADVANCE VOTE LOOK LIKE? As of June 1, there were nearly 4.5 million registered voters in Colorado. Of those, 26% were Democrats, 23% were Republicans and about half were unaffiliated or independent. In the 2022 primaries, turnout was 12% of registered voters in the Democratic primaries and 15% in the Republican primaries. Colorado conducts its elections predominantly by mail. As of Tuesday, a total of 449,721 ballots had already been cast, about 42% in the Democratic primary and 41% in the Republican primary. A total of 75,516 votes have already been cast in the 4th Congressional District special election. HOW LONG DOES VOTE COUNTING USUALLY TAKE? In the 2022 primaries, the AP first reported results at 9:04 p.m. ET, or four minutes after polls closed. The election night tabulation ended at 4:05 a.m. ET with about 90% of total votes counted. ARE WE THERE YET? As of Tuesday, there will be 133 days until the November general election.",

                    "text": "New York (CNN) — Amazon is eliminating the use of the puffy plastic air pillows used in delivery boxes, joining other major companies that are cutting their plastic use. The company said it was shipping 15 billion plastic pillows annually, and the changes represent its largest plastic packaging reduction effort in North America. Amazon has already stopped using them in 95% of deliveries and they will stop completely by the end of the year. A new paper filler made from 100% recycled content will replace the plastic pillows. Amazon says it offers the same, if not better, protection to products. The announcement comes ahead of Prime Day, the shopping spectacular held in July, which Amazon said that nearly all of its Prime Day deliveries will be free of plastic air pillows. Amazon has stopped using plastic pillows in other countries, including Australia, India and nations across Europe, in recent years, which resulted the company in using nearly 12% less plastic in 2023 compared to the year prior. Pollution from single-use plastic remains a major problem, with a recent report finding that companies are producing record amounts despite efforts to be more sustainable. Plastic is problematic because it’s mostly made from polymers created from dangerous fossil fuels. Oceana, an advocacy group that has long criticized Amazon’s plastic use, said the change was a “significant step forward,” but the company “needs to build on this momentum and fulfill its multiyear commitment to transition its North America fulfillment centers away from plastic.” “Then, the company should expand these efforts and also push innovations like reusable packaging to move away from single-use packaging everywhere it sells and ships,” Matt Littlejohn, Oceana’s senior vp of Strategic Initiatives, said in a statement.

                    "text": "Amazon has announced plans to remove 95% of plastic air pillows from its packaging in North America, a major environmental initiative that it hopes will help it reduce its carbon footprint. The move is part of a broader company effort to eventually replace plastic fillers with 100% recyclable paper fillers, which would eliminate nearly 15 billion plastic pillows annually. By opting for paper packaging, Amazon is not only giving it a second life through recycling but also significantly reducing its dependence on plastic, a material derived from fossil fuels. Amazon set to replace plastic packaging with paper fillers “For Prime Day this year, nearly all of our customer deliveries will not contain plastic air pillows,\" the company said. Looking ahead, VP of Mechatronics and Sustainable Packaging, Pat Lindner, said: “We are working towards full removal in North America by end of year and will continue to innovate, test, and scale in order to prioritize curbside recyclable materials.” Amazon has already gained some experience using paper packaging in place of plastic air pillows. Last October, it opened an automated fulfillment center in Ohio that focused on using 100% recycled paper to protect items within its parcels. Amazon states that paper offers “the same, if not better” protection compared with its plastic counterpart, with the added benefit of being recyclable by regular households without having to be sent off to a special recycling facility. The company has also taken other measures to reduce wasted material, such as shipping items in original packaging, which accounted for 11% of all packages globally in 2022. Approaching a $2 trillion market cap, Amazon is the world’s fifth most valuable companies, and with all eyes on its environmental performance, the company hopes that pulling plastic from its packaging will speak volumes.

                    "text": "“We want to ensure that customers receive their items undamaged while using as little packaging as possible to avoid waste and prioritizing recyclable materials,” Amazon said in a press release. “The removal of 95 percent of our plastic air pillows is another step in our path to avoid and reduce packaging—and part of our multi-year effort to remove plastic delivery packaging from North America fulfillment centers.” The e-commerce giant has come under fire about its use of plastic from some environmental groups, including the nonprofit Oceana, which has released its own reports on the plastic packaging waste generated by Amazon. Related StoriesCalifornia Fines Amazon Nearly $6 Million for Violating Warehouse Worker Quota Law6/19/2024Amazon Labor Union in NYC Votes to Join Forces With Teamsters6/18/2024 Matt Littlejohn, senior vice president of strategic initiatives at Oceana, welcomed Amazon’s efforts to reduce plastic packaging but said the company still needs to do more to reduce waste. “While this is a significant step forward for the company, Amazon needs to build on this momentum and fulfill its multiyear commitment to transition its North America fulfillment centers away from plastic,” Mr. Littlejohn said in a statement. “Then, the company should expand these efforts and also push innovations like reusable packaging to move away from single-use packaging everywhere it sells and ships.” Earlier this year, Oceana estimated that Amazon “generated 208 million pounds of plastic packaging waste” in the United States in 2022, up more than 9.6 percent the year before, according to its report, “Amazon’s United States of Plastic.” Amazon investors have broadly supported the company’s efforts and urged it to outline its plan to reduce waste. The company disclosed the amount of single-use plastic it used across global operations for the first time in 2022 after investors sought more details on plans to reduce waste. The company said it used 85,916 metric tons of single-use plastic that year, an 11.6 percent decrease from 2021. “For example, in Europe, the company has claimed it reduced single-use plastic delivery packaging with 100 percent recyclable paper and cardboard throughout its fulfillment network,” Oceana said in a press release in April. Amazon said it began moving away from plastic air pillows in October 2023 at an automated fulfillment center in Ohio, where the company said it was able to test and learn, which helped it transition more quickly to recycled paper filling. The process required Amazon to change machinery and train employees on the new machines and systems. Through its testing, Amazon said it discovered that the paper filler, which is made from 100 percent recyclable content and is curbside recyclable, provides the same—if not better—protection for shipping compared to plastic air pillows. Christian Garcia, who works at Amazon’s fulfillment center in Bakersfield, California, said in a press release that the paper filler is easier to work with and that the machinery gives staff more space so that it’s easier to pack orders. The company’s ongoing efforts to reduce waste include a campaign to ship items without any additional packaging. In 2022, 11 percent of all Amazon’s packages shipped worldwide were without added delivery packaging. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Amazon is working to remove all plastic air pillows in North America by the end of 2024, Pat Lindner, the vice president for sustainable packaging said in a statement.

A 2020 study found 1.9 million microplastic pieces in an area of about 11 square feet in the Mediterranean Sea.Marine life that consumes plastics can get eaten by larger prey, which in turn can get ingested by humans.

The “Good Will Hunting” star admitted to being “a little bit shy” and explained that he doesn’t “like a lot of attention.” “That’s why people see me and they’re like, ‘Why’s this dude always mad?’ Because somebody has their camera and sticks it in my face and I’m like, ‘OK, here we go,’” Affleck continued. The 51-year-old — who shares three kids with ex-wife Jennifer Garner — added that he doesn’t “give a f–” if he’s photographed by himself or while attending an event, but does get pissed off when shutterbugs snap photos while he’s with his family. “Actually, what I’d like to do is much more definitive than just look at you like this,” he said. “I don’t mind; you can take my picture at a club or a premiere, with my wife … Knock yourself out. I don’t notice you. But with my children, that’s a different thing.” “People are projecting something onto me that I don’t feel about myself at all,” he told the comedian. The conversation was recorded in January, before rumors started to circulate that his marriage to Jennifer Lopez was on the rocks. ©2024 New York Daily News. Visit nydailynews.com.

The 5-4 decision rebuffs an agreement that had come recommended by a federal judge overseeing the case over how New Mexico, Texas and Colorado must share water from the Rio Grande. The high court found that the federal government still had claims about New Mexico's water use that the settlement would not resolve. U.S. Circuit Judge Michael Melloy had called the proposal a fair and reasonable way to resolve the conflict between Texas and New Mexico that would be consistent with a decadeslong water-sharing agreement between the two states as well as Colorado. The federal government, though, lodged several objections, including that the proposal did not mandate specific water capture or use limitations within New Mexico. New Mexico officials have said implementing the settlement would require reducing the use of Rio Grande water through a combination of efforts that range from paying farmers to leave their fields barren to making infrastructure improvements. Some New Mexico lawmakers have voiced concerns, but the attorney general who led the state's negotiations had called the agreement a victory. Farmers in southern New Mexico have had to rely more heavily on groundwater wells over the last two decades as drought and climate change resulted in reduced flows and less water in reservoirs along the Rio Grande. Texas sued over the groundwater pumping, claiming the practice was cutting into the amount of water that was ultimately delivered as part of the interstate compact. The proposed settlement would recognize several measurements to ensure New Mexico delivers what’s owed to Texas. New Mexico, meanwhile, agreed to drop its challenges against Texas in exchange for clarifying how water will be accounted for as it flows downstream. The agreement also outlined transfers if not enough or too much water ended up in Texas.",

                    "text": "Subscribe to The Y’all — a weekly dispatch about the people, places and policies defining Texas, produced by Texas Tribune journalists living in communities across the state. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a deal struck between Texas and New Mexico on Friday over the management of water in the Rio Grande, ruling the federal government should have a say in any agreement reached. The 5-4 opinion is the latest twist in a conflict dating back to the 1930s, when Colorado, New Mexico and Texas agreed to share water in the Rio Grande. Most recently in 2022, Texas and New Mexico sought an agreement that side-stepped the federal government. Federal regulators objected because it would impact an international water treaty with Mexico. In the majority opinion, the court said “we cannot now allow Texas and New Mexico to leave the United States up the river without a paddle.” The ruling comes as Texas and other states clamor for water. The region along the Rio Grande, in particular, is still considered in a drought. Water “is never an issue until there isn't enough. When there isn't enough, suddenly everybody starts to look at the various agreements that share this water source,\" said Amy Hardberger, a water law professor at Texas Tech School of Law, about the water conflicts. The decades-long dispute centers around an 80 year-old water agreement, known as the Rio Grande Compact, which legally binds Colorado, New Mexico and Texas to share the water in the Rio Grande. The 1938 agreement ended years of water disputes between the three states and directed how the states should split surface water. Under the compact, Colorado must deliver a proportion of water each year to New Mexico at the state line and New Mexico must deliver a certain amount of water to the Elephant Butte Reservoir, located in southern New Mexico, for Texas. In a 2013 complaint, Texas sued New Mexico, alleging groundwater pumping by New Mexico was taking water from the Rio Grande owed to Texas, causing river levels in the state to drop and depriving Texans of the water they're obligated to. Texas accused New Mexico of violating the interstate compact that has governed water allocations between the two states and Colorado for decades. Water law experts say the Supreme Court's recent decision has significant implications for future interstate water disputes, which would allow the federal government to intervene in water conflicts between states moving forward. Texas and New Mexico came up with a compromise that allowed for a higher number of water pumping from New Mexico than the original 1938 agreement stated, but not big enough to run Texas dry. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which is also responsible for delivering water to Texas and New Mexico, did not agree with their allocations and requested intervention because that same water, in the Rio Grande, impacted the international 1906 water treaty that requires the U.S. to deliver 60,000 acre-feet of water from the Elephant Butte Reservoir to Mexico. The federal government argues it cannot meet its obligation if New Mexico does not comply with their obligations. “You’ve got all these competing responsibilities here that have never been put together in one agreement,” said Gabriel Eckstein, a legal expert on water issues at Texas A&M University. “It’s a number of different projects and agreements that now have to work together so this is why the U.S. government thought to intervene in the dispute.” The U.S. Supreme Court decided that the U.S. needs to be in agreement with Texas and New Mexico. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the International Boundary and Water Commission, which oversees the international treaty, both declined to comment on the ruling. A spokesperson for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality said the agency does not comment on pending litigation. Gage Zobell, a water law expert and attorney with Dorsey & Whitney said today’s decision will allow for the potential increase of federal involvement in water management. “This has turned that long held principle on its head,” Zobell said. “What we have here is Supreme Court precedent that states that there are federal interests that can actually be brought forward as claims when two states are fighting over water, and that the federal government has a seat at the table, and that has been unheard of.” Hardberger, the water law professor at Texas Tech, said that the Texas, U.S. and New Mexico will need to go back to the drawing board to figure out how they are going to resolve this conflict. She said there's an opportunity to continue negotiating, but the court has made it clear that all parties have to be in agreement. “There's definitely not enough water in South Texas and Southwest Texas. I think everyone knows that,” Alex Ortiz, the volunteer Water Reservoir Chair for the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club, adding the ruling doesn’t mean there will be more water or less water available. “It means that it's possible that there's more water than what the consent decree would have allowed for but it's up to the United States now.\" The water disputes come at a time when South Texas battles severe drought conditions, tremendous water shortage issues impacting farmers, and there were these impending conflicts between the U.S. and Mexico about how that water is being shared. While the water in dispute is not directly related to water deliveries in South Texas, one environmentalist group argues there are downstream effects. “If there's not enough water coming into the state as a whole, that puts more pressure on the upper part of the Rio Grande,” Ortiz said. “It changes a little bit of the management strategies for reservoirs that might already be struggling.\" Disclosure: Texas A&M University and Young President's Organization - Lone Star Chapter have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

                    "text": "HENLEY-ON-THAMES, England (AP) — Endurance swimmer Joan Fennelly is undaunted by frigid water and long distances, swimming year-round in the wild. But she takes extra precautions in her own backyard. The River Thames is one of Britain’s many waterways contaminated with sewage and agricultural pollution. “If it looks right, if its smells right, I’ll go in,” Fennelly said. Britain has become notorious as a place where a casual swim could lead to an extended visit to the toilet, if not the hospital. A torrent of news on dirty water has spilled into next month’s election to determine which party controls government for the next four or five years. While not a top campaign issue, it stinks of a larger problem: Britain’s aging infrastructure — from aging schools, hospitals and prisons to pothole-riddled streets. Bad water is decades in the making, tied to the privatization of waterworks under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government in 1989 and to fiscal austerity after the 2008 financial crisis that slashed budgets for watchdogs and others. The British public discovered the extent of the mess during the COVID-19 pandemic as outdoor recreation such as canoeing and wild swimming took off. The sight and smell of feces, toilet paper and other waste in streams and on beaches led to an outcry, along with clean water campaigns by some London newspapers. “We are suffering with shockingly poor infrastructure as a consequence of long-term underinvestment by water utilities who appeared more interested in paying shareholder dividends,” said Nick Kirsop-Taylor, an environmental policy lecturer at the University of Exeter. “There’s far more to it than just that, though … it’s the culture of poor regulation.” Britain had such an anti-regulatory culture on the environment that it was known as the “the dirty man of Europe” in the 1970s and 1980s, Kirsop-Taylor said. That changed when it joined the European Union, but he said there has been backsliding since its vote in 2016 to leave the EU. While private companies have run regional monopolies providing combined water and sewage service, the population has swelled and industrial demand on the system has increased. Plumbing — dating to the Victorian era in many places — has not been updated to meet needs. On top of that, climate change has brought heavier rainfall to overburdened sewers. “The water companies have a choice: they either allow sewage to back up into people’s homes or they open the pipes and it flows out into nature,” said Charles Watson, founder and chair of River Action, founded in 2021. “That is why our rivers are full of human excrement.” The number of untreated sewage discharges increased by more than 50% last year from the previous one to a record 464,000 spills. The cumulative duration of the spills doubled to 3.6 million hours, according to the Environment Agency, one of the two water regulators. The increase was largely due to a wetter year and because monitors have now been installed on most sewage outflow pipes, according to Water UK, a trade group for water companies. But there’s no similar monitoring for farm runoff like manure, an even bigger problem than sewage. While sewage releases are legal during periods of rain, their frequency has drawn scrutiny and led to criticism that the industry’s financial regulator, Ofwat, has not done enough to ensure infrastructure is updated. Water companies accuse Ofwat of not allowing them raise rates enough to finance improvements. Ofwat would not comment on specific criticism because of the pending election but noted that companies had underspent their budgets for improvements by 25% since 2020. Water companies have felt the pressure. Water UK apologized last year for sewage releases, with CEO David Henderson saying the industry should have woken up sooner. “We recognize the current levels of sewage spills are unacceptable and have a plan to sort it out,” Water UK said in a statement to The Associated Press. “Companies want to invest more than 10 billion pounds ($12.7 billion) to reduce spills by 40% by the end of this decade. We now need Ofwat to give us the green light so we can get on with it.” Activists accuse the companies of paying dividends to shareholders while running up large debts. Watson with River Action said the industry paid 11 million pounds ($14 million) last year for environmental violations such as dumping sewage while paying more than 100 times that in dividends — 1.4 billion pounds ($1.8 billion). “That is not a deterrent,” Watson said. “That is an incentive to pollute.” A bipartisan committee in the House of Lords last year found the two regulators needed to go further in fining and prosecuting polluters and needed more government funding. The Environment Agency’s number of prosecutions has declined significantly over the years, from 787 cases in 2007-2008 to 17 in 2020-2021. The Industry and Regulators Committee also said Ofwat had prioritized lower water bills for customers over infrastructure improvements. Political parties are capitalizing on the crisis with tough talk. Labour leader Keir Starmer has accused the Conservative government of “turning Britain’s waterways into an open sewer.” But neither Conservatives nor left-of-center Labour has offered much of a detailed plan. Like most other parties, they have not promised to increase regulator funding. The leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, has made the biggest campaign splash, plunging into water for the cameras. “The Conservatives have allowed the water companies to pump their filthy sewage into our rivers, into our lakes, onto our beaches and into our sea,” Davey said as he announced a detailed plan that includes replacing Ofwat with a tougher new regulator. The Green Party, which struggles in a political system that makes it hard for small parties to win seats in Parliament, has even suggested that water services be nationalized again. Some communities agree. The town council in Henley-on-Thames, in a Conservative bastion west of London, this month cast votes of no confidence in Thames Water, which is on the brink of insolvency, and called for its water provider to be nationalized. The town is the site of the Henley Royal Regatta that draws 50,000 people a day for rowing races in July. But dirty water has tarnished its image. The center of town is downstream from a Thames Water sewage treatment plant, which the company says it plans to upgrade by the end of 2026. “I wouldn’t swim that stretch for love nor money,” said endurance swimmer Fennelly, who suspects she got a nasty E. coli infection once there. She and other members of the Henley Mermaids, a group of wild swimmers, now consult the Thames Water phone app that shows sewage releases. They also do the sniff test before jumping in. On a recent morning, Fennelly and Jo Robb walked across a pasture, tied floating devices around their waists and climbed down to the Thames. The current was strong from rain the night before. Robb screamed as she hit the river, not because it was dirty, but because of the chill. It was refreshing — the way water should be.",

Alaska Wildlife Troopers and the Alaskan Command identified the men as Col. Mark “Tyson” Sletten, 46, of Anchorage, and Paul Kondrat, 41, of Utah. They were aboard a small airplane on an instructional flight that crashed into Crescent Lake near Moose Pass on Alaska’s Kenai Peninsula on Tuesday.

Two hikers had notified troopers that they saw a plane crash at Crescent Lake near Moose Pass on Tuesday afternoon. An Alaska Department of Public Safety helicopter and U.S. Fish and Wildlife float plane went to the area and found debris on the lake but no signs of survivors in the water or on shore.

Clint Johnson, who is the Alaska regional chief with the National Transportation and Safety Board, said it isn’t known how deep the plane is in the water. “There were some witnesses at Crescent Lake that apparently saw this accident,” he said, according to Alaska’s News Source. “The NTSB is in the process of trying to talk with those witnesses to get a good account of what they saw. But my understanding is they’re still in the field, and hopefully that’ll take place by the end of the day.” Alaskan Command is located at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage.

Col. Mark \"Tyson\" Sletten, 46, was reported missing Tuesday after two hikers witnessed a plane crash at Crescent Lake near Moose Pass on the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska and contacted state troopers. By Thursday, his body had been recovered and he was confirmed among the deceased on the aircraft. \"The news has been devastating for all of us here at Alaskan Command, and the loss of Tyson is being felt throughout our community,\" Lt.

David Nahom, the head of Alaskan Command, said in a news release Friday. \"Right now, our priority is taking care of his family and our teammates that were close to Tyson.\" Read Next: Sailors Who Fail 2 Consecutive Fitness Tests Will No Longer Face the End of Their Career, Navy Says Sletten was in a Piper PA-18 Super Cub, a small, civilian two-seater airplane, alongside Paul Kondrat, a 41-year-old Utah resident. A search team consisting of the Alaska Army National Guard and professional volunteers from the Alaska Dive Search, Rescue and Recovery Team located the crashed plane Thursday in nearly 200 feet of water. \"Both Paul Kondrat and Mark Sletten were found inside of the plane deceased,\" the Alaska Department of Public Safety said in a statement. \"Their bodies were transported to the State Medical Examiner's Office for autopsy. Next of kin have been notified.\" The Anchorage Daily News reported that the plane was operated by Alaska Float Ratings and that Kondrat was a certified flight instructor with the company. Sletten was the director of operations for Alaskan Command, or ALCOM, which is a subordinate group of U.S. Northern Command based at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. It's responsible for joint operations among 16,000 Air Force, Army, Navy and Coast Guard personnel in the state. According to photo archives in the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service, Sletten also previously served as the 8th Fighter Squadron commander at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. That squadron was reactivated in 2017, and Sletten was part of the leadership that revived the F-16 Fighting Falcon training unit. Sletten identified himself as a fighter pilot on his LinkedIn page. \"Our mission is to build the future of air power and to lead the Air Force in developing airmen while training F-16 fighter pilots,\" Sletten said in a 2017 press release. \"My goal is to produce airmen and fighter pilots who are first and foremost professionals, and who are lethal and passionate when it comes to their craft.\" The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating to determine the cause of the crash, according to the Division of Alaska State Troopers.

The Post’s CEO and publisher, Will Lewis, announced Winnett’s decision to withdraw in a note to staff on Friday morning. He will stay as deputy editor of the Telegraph in London. Several published reports had raised questions about Winnett’s involvement in articles where a source was paid and information gathered through deceptive means — practices more commonplace in England but frowned upon by journalists in the United States. As part of a reorganization that has backfired, Lewis had named Winnett, a former colleague, to take over the Post’s core newsroom functions after the November election.

                    "title": "UK Telegraph's Robert Winnett won't become top editor at Washington Post: report",
                    "text": "Robert Winnett, the deputy editor of the British broadsheet Telegraph, will not be joining The Washington Post as its top editor, according to a report. “I’m pleased to report that Rob Winnett has decided to stay with us. As you all know, he’s a talented chap and their loss is our gain,” Telegraph Editor Chris Evans said in an email to staff. Washington Post Chief Executive William Lewis confirmed the change in a note to staff, adding that the paper will launch a formal search for a new editor. “It is with regret that I share with you that Robert Winnett has withdrawn from the position of Editor at The Washington Post,” Lewis wrote. “Rob has my greatest respect and is an incredibly talented editor and journalist.” The news reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. The Post has sought comment from The Washington Post. Winnet was slated to assume the role of editor at The Washington Post after this fall’s presidential elections. He was picked for the job by Lewis, another Brit who recently was named chief executive and publisher at the Jeff Bezos-owned publication, which has been hemorrhaging cash in recent years. The appointment of Lewis has raised hackles at the paper, where Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists went on record and demanded that Bezos reverse course and remove Lewis over questions about his integrity and ethics. More than a decade ago, Lewis was a senior executive at News International, the parent company of the now-defunct News of the World, whose reporters were accused of hacking the phones of high-profile officials in the UK. Lewis has denied any wrongdoing in the phone hacking scandal. News International has since been renamed News UK, which shares common ownership with The New York Post. Last weekend, The Washington Post published an investigative piece digging into Winnett’s journalistic past. The story alleged that Winnett had close ties to a trained actor who used subterfuge and illegal means to obtain information, including an attempt to steal a soon-to-be-released copy of a memoir by former Prime Minister Tony Blair. A New York Times article last week reported that Lewis and Winnett both used fraudulently obtained phone and company records in newspaper articles while they worked as journalists in the UK two decades ago. Lewis assigned the article based on stolen information when he was business editor of The Sunday Times, according to the report. Winnett’s byline appears on another story that is alleged to have been based on information that was fraudulently obtained, according to The New York Times. At the time that Lewis and Winnett were working for The Sunday Times, the newspaper was relying on the services of a private investigator who later acknowledged that he obtained information using deceptive means. The Sunday Times, however, has denied that it ever paid anyone to break the law. The Sunday Times is owned by Times Newspapers Limited, which is a subsidiary of News Corp, The Post’s parent company. The New York Times also reported last week that Lewis paid more than 100,000 British pounds — which was equal to around $160,000 — to a source in exchange for information while he was editor of The Daily Telegraph. Most American newspapers adhere to a policy that bars payment to sources. News of the appointment of both Lewis and Winnett outraged newsroom staffers at The Washington Post, who say that these alleged ethics lapses by the two British journalists disqualify them from a position of leadership at the venerable paper. Bezos on Tuesday sent a memo to top editors at The Washington Post in which he expressed his “full commitment on maintaining the quality, ethics and standards we all believe in.” David Maraniss, an associate editor at The Washington Post who has won two Pulitzer Prizes, wrote a Facebook post demanding that Bezos dismiss Lewis. “I don’t know a single person at the Post who thinks the current situation with the publisher and supposed new editor can stand,” Maraniss wrote. “There might be a few, but very very few.” Scott Higham, another Pulitzer-winning journalist at the newspaper, seconded Maraniss’ argument, writing in reply on Facebook: “Will Lewis needs to step down for the good of The Post and the public.” “He has lost the newsroom and will never win it back.”",

                    "text": "The man tapped to become the top editor of the Washington Post is no longer going to join the media outlet, the paper said on June 21. “It is with regret that I share with you that Robert Winnett has withdrawn from the position of Editor at The Washington Post,” William Lewis, CEO and publisher of the Post, wrote in a note to staffers. Mr. Winnett is remaining at The Daily Telegraph, a British paper, he said. “We will immediately launch a new search for Editor of our core coverage. We will soon announce both the recruiting firm and process we will utilize to ensure a timely but thorough search for this important leadership role,” Mr. Lewis wrote. Mr. Winnett, the Telegraph’s deputy editor, could not be reached. Mr. Lewis, 55, is a native of England who was editor of the Telegraph from 2006 to 2009. He hired Mr. Winnett to be the Post’s top editor after Sally Buzbee, the paper’s executive editor, resigned rather than take the position. Matt Murray, former editor-in-chief of the Wall Street Journal, will remain the Post’s executive editor until after the November presidential election, according to Mr. Lewis. Mr. Winnett was set to become the editor, a new position, starting after the election, the Post said in a press release dated June 2. The paper said at the time he “has an excellent track record in investigative reporting, delivering scoops and leading significant newsroom transformations.” The Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has been losing money in recent years. Mr. Lewis informed employees in May that the company lost $77 million over the past year. “To speak candidly: We are in a hole, and we have been for some time,” he said, the Post reported. He called the situation “repairable.” Mr. Bezos said in an email to senior editors on Tuesday that he’s committed to “maintaining the quality, ethics, and standards we all believe in.” He said “we do need to change as a business” but that the Post’s journalistic standards would not change. Mr. Lewis plans to unveil a new division of the newsroom to try to rectify the financial situation, according to the company. It said in a statement the division “will be comprised of service and social media journalism and run separately from the core news operation,” with a goal of giving Americans “who feel traditional news is not for them but still want to be kept informed compelling, exciting and accurate news where they are and in the style that they want.” The new division is slated to be fully rolled out in early 2025, Mr. Lewis said on Friday.",

                    "text": "In a reversal, British journalist Robert Winnett will not become The Washington Post editor and will remain at his job in London, the D.C. newspaper reported Friday. Mr. Winnett will stay at the Daily Telegraph after a tumultuous few weeks at the storied Washington newspaper and a revolt against his announced hiring. The Post raised questions about journalistic practices used by Mr. Winnett and the new Post executive who hired him, William Lewis, during their work in U.K. newsrooms. “I’m pleased to report that Rob Winnett has decided to stay with us,” Telegraph editor Chris Evans wrote in a staff memo obtained by The Post. British newsrooms operate differently than American ones, and the abrupt departure of Post Executive Editor Sally Buzbee sparked reports that the incoming U.K. executives may have done stories based on stolen records. The revelations sparked drama and soul-searcing at the D.C. newspaper and forced Amazon founder and Post owner Jeff Bezos to weigh in, promising the staff that journalistic standards would not change. The proposed leadership changes were designed to breathe life into the paper, which like other outlets has suffered from a drop in readership and revenue.",

                    "text": "Dear Amy: Several years ago, I was involved in projects with a female friend (I’m a man). I occasionally made jokes and said things that in retrospect I realize were inappropriate. She finally set me straight. Then Covid and the MeToo movement hit, and I had time to revisit a number of things that at the time I felt were innocent remarks or actions, but were in fact wrong. We have since become friends again, but I occasionally think that I’d like to apologize for every time I made her uncomfortable. I know there are other men who have been even guiltier than I, but they have never apologized. Do I need to? Would my apologizing now, years later, be just for my benefit – or would it be a kind gesture to a good friend? – Conflicted Dear Conflicted: Other people doing worse things than you have done should not enter into your equation. You cannot justify your own choices by finding negative examples to compare yourself to. There is no downside for you to apologize to your friend for mistakes, “jokes” or comments you made years ago. She called you out at the time, and your friendship took a hit, but seems to have recovered. Maya Angelou said it best: “Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.” An apology would definitely benefit you, and offering forgiveness (if necessary) would also benefit her. You say that your friend “set you straight” at the time and that your friendship suffered. Opening up a discussion and offering her your current perspective and understanding – along with an apology – will help both of you to close the loop on this and move forward with greater understanding and intimacy. Dear Readers: The following Q&A first ran in 2020. Dear Amy: My family and I came to America from the Soviet Union when I was a teenager. We became citizens. I got educated here and own a successful business. I write well and speak correctly, with almost no accent. I feel like I am an American. I love America, and try to learn new things every day, but I feel like something is missing in me. Since I spent my formative years in a communist country (truly like another planet, compared to the USA), my “autopilot” reactions are not like those of typical American-born people. For instance, my manners, topics of conversation, humor, dress, attitude toward money, and even body language can seem “foreign.” I feel like it is hurting me to be “culturally different.” I don’t think I say or do anything straight-up offensive – it’s more like a lot of little things. How can I fix this “handicap”? I would love to know how to be more American, but I can’t find any books or courses on the subject. – NOT Born in the USA Dear NOT: As we approach the celebration of another Independence Day, I appreciate this unusual and provocative question, which, honestly – has no “correct” answer. First, I urge you not to see your own cultural background and habits as a “handicap,” but as an asset. Yes, America is a country. But America is also really a series of concepts, experiments, and experiences. It is no one thing. But here is a beautiful “American” ideal (so different from the culture you were raised in): All Americans have the right to be uniquely themselves, and that definitely includes you. However, reinvention is baked into the American experience, and so if you want to affect “American” mannerisms, I suggest you become a student of American culture. Take a history course at your local community college. Follow up with a class on cinema and popular culture. Read Mark Twain, Edith Wharton, Sherman Alexie, Gary Shteyngart, and Jericho Brown. Listen to Dolly Parton. Watch “Singing in the Rain,” “Goodfellas,” “Barbershop,” “13 th,” and “Ramy.” Become a volunteer firefighter. Teach English as a second language to other newer citizens (teaching American concepts to others will show you how much you actually know). Work at your local polling station during the next election. When you say or do something you believe is “off,” ask a friend to break it down for you. They might choose to tell you what I’m trying to tell you now – which is that your effort makes you the most “American” person they know. Dear Readers: R. Eric Thomas is starting a new advice column.

                    "text": "MILWAUKEE — People will be allowed to carry guns within blocks of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next month and protesters will be given two stages, one within sight of the convention arena, under a security plan local and federal law enforcement authorities released Friday. The plan comes in the wake of a federal lawsuit demanding protesters be allowed within view and hearing range of downtown Milwaukee’s Fiserv Forum. The plan calls for two roughly circular perimeters that extend for blocks around the arena. Vehicles will have to pass through checkpoints to travel between the two boundaries. Pedestrians will be allowed to move freely without being screened in that area. Only convention goers will be allowed within the inner perimeter. No weapons of any kind will be allowed within the inner perimeter but people will be able to carry guns openly or concealed elsewhere as allowed under state law. Wisconsin statutes outlaw only machine guns, short-barreled shotguns and silencers. “It’s about behaviors,” Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman said. “So, understand that there is going to be that level of surveillance and monitoring that that’s the particular right that you like to express. Just don’t do anything that could be considered a threat or harm to the public.” More than 100 organizations have applied to demonstrate at the convention so far, Nick DeSiato, Mayor Cavalier Johnson’s chief of staff, said during a news conference. The Coalition to March on the RNC, a group of local and national organizations including the Milwaukee Democratic Socialists of America, immigrant advocacy group Voces de La Frontera and the American Party of Labor, has planned a protest parade on the first day of the convention. The coalition contends that it has been trying to obtain a permit for the parade since April 2023 but city officials still haven’t granted it. The city also has been slow-walking release of a parade route, the coalition maintains, raising fears that the city won’t allow protesters within sight of the arena. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit on the coalition’s behalf on June 5 alleging the delay in releasing a route amounts to a denial in violation of the coalition’s free speech rights. The ACLU has asked U.S. District Judge Brett Ludwig to issue a temporary injunction forcing the city to designate a route within sight and hearing of the arena and immediately process the coalition’s permit applications. Ludwig has set a scheduling conference for the case on Monday. The security plan authorities released Friday establishes a parade route just inside the far southern edge of the outer perimeter, about five blocks from the arena, with a stage for speakers within the route. Asked if he believes the route will satisfy the coalition, DeSiato said it runs along the inner perimeter fence and that was as close as authorities could get marchers to the arena when considering exit points and emergency vehicle access. He said setting up the route as a “very complicated math problem.” The plan also establishes a stage for protest speakers on the northern edge of the perimeter about a block from Fiserv Forum. DeSiato said the city will provide a sound system for speakers on both stages but each speaker will be limited to 20 minutes to ensure everyone gets a chance to talk. ACLU attorney Tim Muth said in a statement that the organization was “surprised and disappointed” at the sheer size of the inner perimeter. The large radius makes it more important that the city allow free expression and assembly, he said, and he promised to continue the lawsuit. “We hope for a swift ruling that will vindicate the Coalition’s plan for a march that passes within sight and sound of Fiserv Forum,” he said.",

                    "text": "He was initially an ambassador from the Hippie Nation, a force of irreverence armed with a sharp wit and a what-me-worry smile. Which is why, in the late 1960s, right when Flower Power was beginning to bloom in full and the escalating situation in Vietnam galvanized the youth generation, Donald Sutherland started to make a name for himself in… war movies. It’s funny to think of that factoid now, given the six decades of incredibly versatile work the late, great actor left behind when he passed away yesterday at the age of 88 — the only unifying factor between his peacenik heroes, period-piece Fascists, grieving fathers, flirty college professors, whistleblowers, space cowboys and dystopian dictators was the level of quality he put into portraying all of them. But while Sutherland would participate in a traveling show known as FTA (Fuck the Army) at the height of the counterculture’s radicalization period, he logged in a lot of time as a man in uniform in one of the most conservative genres around. How those films used this grinning, slightly zonked young man, however, would prove to be a stroke of genius. There is no better place to subvert than from within. You do not get a more he-man WWII romp than The Dirty Dozen, the 1967 adventure with Lee Marvin, Robert Ryan, Charles Bronson, Jim Brown and overall dangerously high testosterone levels. Like the rest of the recruits, Sutherland’s Vernon L. Pinkley is a convict who’s chosen for a suicide mission, because what’s a felon got to gain but his freedom and lose except his life? This particular member of the Dozen is a little dim. And yet, Pinkley is the guy that the group’s leader picks to impersonate a General to fool the military brass. He passes on the offer. Except: This is not a request, soldier. So Pinkley, still in his grunt attire, plays along under duress and pretends to inspect the troops. And here is where you first get a glimpse of why Sutherland, who’s already logged in a solid five years doing bit parts on TV shows and cheapo horror movies, will become not only a major actor but a star in the next few years. He shuffles toward the line of privates, but not before he glances over his shoulder and gives his fellow Dirties a loony, tongue-out look. Then, in just a few steps, Pinkley transforms himself from runt of the litter to a loose caricature of an officer and a gentleman. Head up, hands behind his back. He wonders aloud if these boys can really fight. Where you from, son? Madison City, Missouri, sir, replies one soldier. Pinkley shakes his head. “Neverrrr heard of it,” he says, before striding on. Here was a guy mocking everything sacred about both the Greatest Generation’s legacy and the contemporary Army, the stand-in for every kid who worried about their draft number coming up and wondered “what are we fightin’ for?” He was the fly in your father’s-war-movie ointment, and would play a similar anachronism in the Clint Eastwood men-on-a-mission goof Kelly’s Heroes (1970) a few years later. But it was that same year’s M*A*S*H that cemented him as a proto–gross-out comedy hero, a sex symbol and a genuine above-the-title name. His Hawkeye Pierce and Elliott Gould’s Trapper John M.D. are a great double act, choosing gallows humor, pranks and the occasional happy-hour interlude as a way of celebrating life amidst a landscape of death. The movie took place during the Korean War, but y’know: wink, wink, wink. The movie struck a chord, and Sutherland was one of the main guys responsible for making that strummed chord resonate. Welcome to New Hollywood. Check your manners and your blind faith in institutions at the studio gate. M*A*S*H would kick off a decade of American filmmaking Sutherland would partially come to define, even if the people who worship that glorious maverick era tend to go to the Method guys like Hoffman, Pacino and De Niro first. But from the bearded, Christ-like figures he played in movies like Alex in Wonderland and Little Murders (and actual Christ figure in Johnny Got Your Gun) to the white knight savior of Klute to the curly-mopped lead of Don’t Look Now and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Sutherland slowly established himself as one of the era’s major players. This shot is now iconic, but even out of context, that hairdo and ‘stache alone virtually scream “the Seventies.” More importantly, Sutherland was the perfect actor for that moment in film history because he could seem sexy yet accessible, hip yet somehow out of touch, solid yet lost, steadfast yet disillusioned. As the counterculture started to recede into the distance, he could somehow come off as the embodiment of the ’60s hangover that was the Nixon/Ford years and the bartender gleefully serving the cocktails. By the late 1970s, Sutherland was already playing authority figures like Professor Jennings in Animal House, the college teacher who may get kids stoned and has no moral issues regarding sex with his students, but is quick to remind them that they still have to turn in their papers on Paradise Lost. (“This is my job!”) When the odometer turned over into the 1980s, his first major role was in Robert Redford’s Oscar-winner Ordinary People, playing not just a numbed-by-grief dad but one half of the silver screen’s ultimate repressed-WASP parents. There were still romantic leads and cool cats ahead — we’re partial to his German spy in the underrated 1981 thriller Eye of the Needle — but Sutherland’s patriarchal phase would kick off in earnest now. Scroll through IMDb, and you’ll start to see “Dr.,” “Father” (as in priest) and “Sergeant” increasingly show up before his characters’ names. He’d also establish himself as a go-to guy when you needed someone to make an impact ASAP. His handle in Oliver Stone’s conspiracy-theorist nocturnal emission JFK (1991) is simply “X,” and Sutherland is only in one dense, dialogue-heavy scene on a bench. He’s still somehow the single most unforgettable element in that film. He’d spend the last 30 years of his career as what we tend to call “character actors,” gracing everything from teen horror comedies (the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie) to sports dramas (Without Limits), serial-killer thrillers (Citizen X) to tony literary adaptations (the 2005 take on Pride & Prejudice, where he turns Mr. Bennett’s climactic speech into a cinema du Jane Austen all-timer — he always claimed this was his favorite role). When he did get the chance to do more, in movies like Six Degrees of Separation (1993) or the FX limited series Trust (2018), you were reminded of how much he had to offer and the deft way he played the emotional scales. A generation will forever know him as President Snow, the grandfatherly embodiment of pure evil at the center of the Hunger Games franchise. Yet no matter how small the part or how few the lines, Sutherland always knew how to snag you. He could use that singular, signature baritone to break your heart or make you involuntarily move your bowels. That twinkle in his eye, the same one you see in Vernon L. Pinkley’s eye when he decides to fully commit to hoodwinking the U.S. Army, never left Sutherland. He was an actor whose career spanned everything from the Pentagon Papers to QAnon, and whose permed visage really did become synonymous with a certain maverick moment in film history. It still feels like he never really got his due. Calling him anything less than one of the greatest screen actors of all time is, quite simply, getting it wrong. And Donald Sutherland was, by his own admission, someone who always went to great lengths to get it just right.",

                    "text": "Donald Sutherland, who has died aged 88, brought his disturbing and unconventional presence to bear in scores of films after his breakthrough role of Hawkeye Pierce, the army surgeon in Robert Altman’s M*A*S*H (1970), one of the key American films of its period. It marked Sutherland out as an iconoclastic figure of the 60s generation, but he matured into an actor who made a speciality of portraying taciturn, self-doubting characters. This was best illustrated in his portrayal of the tormented parent of a drowned girl, seeking solace in a wintry Venice, in Nicolas Roeg’s Don’t Look Now (1973), and of the weak, nervous, concerned father of a guilt-ridden teenage boy (Timothy Hutton) in Robert Redford’s Ordinary People (1980). Although Sutherland appeared in the statutory number of stinkers that are many a film actor’s lot, he was always watchable. His career resembled a man walking a tightrope between undemanding parts in potboilers and those in which he was able to take risks, such as the title role in Federico Fellini’s Casanova (1976). Curiously, it was Sutherland’s ears that first got him noticed, in Robert Aldrich’s The Dirty Dozen (1967). During the shoot, according to Sutherland, “Clint Walker sticks up his hand and says, ‘Mr Aldrich, as a representative of the Native American people, I don’t think it’s appropriate to do this stupid scene where I have to pretend to be a general.’ Aldrich turns and points to me and says, ‘You with the big ears. You do it’ … It changed my life.” In other words, it led to M*A*S*H and stardom. Sutherland and his M*A*S*H co-star Elliott Gould were at odds with Altman because they did not think the director knew what he was doing due to his unorthodox methods. In the early days, Sutherland was known to have confrontations with his directors. “What I was trying to do all the time was to impose my thinking,” he remarked some years later. “Now I contribute. I offer. I don’t put my foot down.” Sutherland, who was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, was a sickly child who battled rheumatic fever, hepatitis and polio. He spent most of his teenage years in Nova Scotia where his father, Frederick, ran a local gas, electricity and bus company; his mother, Dorothy (nee McNichol), was a maths teacher. He attended Bridgewater high school, then graduated from Victoria College, part of the University of Toronto, with a double major in engineering and drama. As a result of a highly praised performance in a college production of James Thurber’s and Elliott Nugent’s The Male Animal, he dropped the idea of becoming an engineer and decided to pursue acting. With this in mind, he left Canada for the UK in 1957 to study at Lamda (the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art), where he was considered too tall and ungainly to get anywhere. However, he gained a year’s work as a stage actor with the Perth repertory company, and appeared in TV series such as The Saint and The Avengers. He was Fortinbras in a 1964 BBC production of Hamlet, shot at Elsinore castle and starring Christopher Plummer. He also appeared at the Criterion theatre in the West End in The Gimmick in 1962. In 1959 he married Lois Hardwick; they divorced in 1966. Then he married the film producer Shirley Douglas, with whom he had twins, Kiefer and Rachel; they divorced in 1971. Kiefer, who grew up to become a celebrated actor, was named after the producer-writer Warren Kiefer, who put Sutherland in an Italian-made Gothic horror film, The Castle of the Living Dead (1964). Christopher Lee played a necrophile count, while Sutherland doubled as a dim-witted police sergeant and, in drag and heavy makeup, as a witch. In an earlier era, the gawky Sutherland might not have achieved the stardom that followed the anarchic M*A*S*H, but Hollywood at the time was open for stars with unconventional looks, and Sutherland was much in demand for eccentric roles throughout the 70s. He was impressive as a moviemaker with “director’s block” in Paul Mazursky’s messy but interesting Alex in Wonderland (1970), which contains a prescient dream sequence in which his titular character meets Fellini. In the same year, Sutherland played a Catholic priest and the object of Geneviève Bujold’s erotic gaze in Act of the Heart; he was the appropriately named Sergeant Oddball, an anachronistic hippy tank commander, in the second world war action-comedy Kelly’s Heroes; and he and Gene Wilder were two pairs of twins in 18th-century France in the broad comedy Start the Revolution Without Me. Sutherland was at his most laconic, sometimes verging on the soporific, in the title role of Alan J Pakula’s Klute (1971), as a voyeuristic ex-policeman investigating the disappearance of a friend and getting deeply involved with a prostitute, played by Jane Fonda. Sutherland and Fonda were teamed up again as a couple of misfits in the caper comedy Steelyard Blues (1973). It initially had a limited distribution due mainly to their participation together in the anti-Vietnam war troop show FTA (Fuck the Army), which Sutherland co-directed, co-scripted and co-produced. Sutherland always made his political views known, although they surfaced only occasionally in his films. In among the many mainstream comedies and thrillers was Roeg’s supernatural drama Don’t Look Now, in which Sutherland and Julie Christie are superb as a couple grieving their dead daughter. Despite the dark subject matter, the film was notable for containing “one of the sexiest love scenes in film history”, according to Scott Tobias in the Guardian, the frank depiction of their love-making coming “like a desert flower poking through concrete”. The actor so admired Roeg that he named another son after him, one of his three sons with the French-Canadian actor Francine Racette, whom he married in 1972. John Schlesinger’s rambling version of The Day of the Locust (1975) saw Sutherland as a sexually repressed character – called Homer Simpson – who tramples a woman to death in an act of uncontrolled rage. Perhaps Bernardo Bertolucci had that in mind when he cast Sutherland in 1900 (Novecento, 1976), in which he is a broadly caricatured fascist thug who shows his sadism by smashing a cat’s head against a post and bashing a young boy’s brains out. “And I turned down Deliverance and Straw Dogs because of the violence!” Sutherland recalled. In Fellini’s Casanova, the second of his two bizarre Italian excursions in 1976, Sutherland calculates seduction under his heavily made-up features. The performance, as stylised as it is, still reveals the suffering soul within the sex machine. In 1978 he appeared in Claude Chabrol’s Blood Relatives, a made-in-Canada murder mystery with Sutherland playing a Montreal cop investigating the murder of a young woman. More commercial was The Eagle Has Landed (1976), with Sutherland, attempting an Irish accent, as an IRA member supporting the Germans during the second world war, and as a chilling Nazi in Eye of the Needle (1981). Meanwhile, he was the hero of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), who resists the insidious alien menace until the film’s devastating final shot. In 1981 Sutherland returned to the stage, as Humbert Humbert in a highly anticipated version of Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita, adapted by Edward Albee. It turned out to be a huge flop, running only 12 performances on Broadway. Both Sutherland and Albee played the blame game. “The second act is flawed,” Sutherland said. “Albee was supposed to have rethought it, but he never did.” Albee told reporters that he had scuttled some of his best scenes because they were “too difficult” for Sutherland because “he hasn’t been on stage for 17 years”. Continuing his film career, Sutherland played a complex and sadistic British officer in Hugh Hudson’s Revolution (1985), and in A Dry White Season (1989) he took the role of an Afrikaner schoolteacher beginning to understand the brutal realities of apartheid. In Oliver Stone’s JFK (1991), he held the screen with an extended monologue as he spilled the conspiracy beans to Kevin Costner’s district attorney hero Jim Garrison. After having made contact with young audiences in the 70s with offbeat appearances in gross-out pictures The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977) and National Lampoon’s Animal House (1978), the latter as a pot-smoking professor, he was cast as an unconvincing bearded stranger in Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992). On a more adult level were Six Degrees of Separation (1993), in which he played an unfulfilled art dealer; A Time to Kill (1996), as an alcoholic lawyer (alongside Kiefer); Without Limits (1998), as an enthusiastic athletics coach; and Space Cowboys (2000), as an elderly pilot. By this time, he was gradually moving into grey-haired character roles, one of the best being his amiable Mr Bennet in Pride and Prejudice (2005). The Jane Austen novel was also featured in the television series Great Books (1993-2000), to which Sutherland lent his soothing voice as narrator. Other series in which he shone as quasi baddies were Commander in Chief (2005) – as the sexist Republican speaker of the house opposed to the new president (Geena Davis) – and Dirty Sexy Money (2007-09), in which he played a powerful patriarch of a wealthy family. Sutherland continued to be active well into his 80s, his long grey hair and beard signifying sagacity, whether as a contract killer in The Mechanic, a Roman hero in The Eagle, a nutty retired poetry professor in Man on the Train (all 2011), or a quirky bounty hunter in the western Dawn Rider (2012), bringing more depth to the characters than they deserved. As President Coriolanus Snow, the autocratic ruler of the dystopian country of Panem in The Hunger Games (2012), Sutherland was discovered by a new generation; he went on to reprise the role in three further films in that franchise, beginning with The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013). He played artists in two art-world thrillers by Italian directors: in Giuseppe Tornatore’s Deception, AKA The Best Offer (2013), he was a would-be painter helping to execute multimillion-dollar scams, while in Giuseppe Capotondi’s The Burnt Orange Heresy (2019) he was on the other side of the heist as a reclusive genius targeted by a wealthy and unscrupulous dealer (Mick Jagger). Aside from James Gray’s science-fiction drama Ad Astra (also 2019), in which he co-starred with Brad Pitt, Sutherland’s best late work was all for television. In Danny Boyle’s mini-series Trust (2018), which covered the same real-life events as Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World, he played J Paul Getty, the oil tycoon whose grandson is kidnapped; while in The Undoing (2020), he was the father of a psychologist (Nicole Kidman), reluctantly putting up bail when her husband (Hugh Grant) is arrested for murder. For the latter role Sutherland was in the running for a Golden Globe, having received an honorary Oscar in 2017, eight years after Leigh Singer in this newspaper named him as one of the 10 best actors never to have been nominated. “Is it because he’s Canadian?” asked the writer. No matter: Sutherland graced a Canada Post commemorative stamp in 2023. He is survived by Francine and his children, Kiefer, Rachel, Rossif, Angus and Roeg, and by four grandchildren.

The officials said Friday that 64-year-old Juliana Gle Tourneau was killed when an elephant that was part of a herd the tourists were watching attacked their vehicle, threw Tourneau out and trampled her. She was part of a group that had stopped near the Maramba Cultural Bridge due to the traffic caused by the elephant herd near the bridge, they added. \"Juliana Gle Tourneau, 64, of New Mexico, United States of America, died on Wednesday around 17.50 after being knocked from a parked vehicle which had stopped due to traffic caused by elephants around the Maramba Cultural Bridge,\" Southern Province Police Commissioner Auxensio Daka told the Zambian national broadcaster, ZNBC.

                    "text": "LONDON (AP) — Taylor Swift fans enjoy parsing the singer-songwriter’s lyrics for references to her romantic life and insights into her state of her mind. But the pop superstar’s fans in the U.K. didn’t have to listen closely to her latest album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” to get the sense that Swift had soured on the country’s capital city after long making it a regular hangout and then her second home. The record’s fifth track is titled “So Long, London.” As Swift brings her blockbuster Eras Tour to London’s Wembley Stadium, some Swifties therefore are wondering if they are witnessing the beginning of an extended goodbye. She is performing three nights starting Friday, and is scheduled to return to Wembley for six nights in August to close the tour’s European leg. London is the only city on the tour where Swift is stopping twice. Some worry the arrangement may represent a swan song of sorts, while others think it just reflects a new era in Swift’s bond with the Big Smoke. Whether “So Long, London” turns out to be a final chapter or a bookend to her valentine to the city, the song “London Boy,” Eras is arriving as an emotional milestone. “Her relationship now kind of assumes London won’t be somewhere she will be. It’s not like there is an American football player living here,” said Maggie Fekete, 22, a Canadian graduate student who credits the London references in Swift’s music with orienting her when she moved to the city three years ago. “I think there will be a lot less London in her music, which is sad.” For those who haven’t been paying attention, Swift had a series of romances with famous British citizens, starting with Harry Styles in 2012 and ending last year, when she started dating Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. The speculation surrounding “So Long, London” and a mournful companion song that mentions a London pub, “The Black Dog,” stems from the 2023 breakup of Swift and English actor Joe Alwyn, who were together for over six years. Alwyn is assumed to have inspired “London Boy,” a song from her 2019 album “Lover.” A special-edition “Lover” CD included what appeared to be a January 2017 diary entry in which Swift talked about being “essentially based in London” but trying to lay low. British tabloids later reported that Swift spent much of the COVID-19 pandemic sheltering with Alwyn in north London. The Sun newspaper reported in December that the multiple Grammy-winner had bought a large property in the area and was remodeling it to be her base in Europe. After Swift released “The Tortured Poets Department” last month, however, a writer for the British edition of ELLE magazine observed that Londoners had an opening “for an all-American A-lister who can slot into her place in our collective consciousness.” “We had Swift before we lost her to her record-breaking, box office-breaking Eras Tour and now, it would appear that her vacant position has been filled by Zendaya,” writer Naomi May playfully posited before listing the various locations the American actor had been spotted with her longtime boyfriend, British actor Tom Holland. Either way, the capital is putting on quite a show of its own to make sure Swift and her fans feel appreciated. Guides are offering walking, bus and taxi tours that retrace her footsteps, including a kebab shop whose owner says his establishment is supplying sandwiches for the singer and her crew on Friday. Before the end of August, Swifties can partake in a full diet of Swift-themed brunches and dance parties, or ride the London Eye Ferris wheel accompanied by a string quarter playing her music. Souvenir stalls in Camden Market, one of the places mentioned in “London Boy,” stocked up on Swift-specific caps, T-shirts, bags and stickers in preparation. “We’re very proud that London is hosting more shows than any other city on Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour, a real testament to her love for London,” Laura Citron, CEO of tourism agency London & Partners, said. Fans started lining up outside Wembley on Thursday in hopes of being among the first ticket-holders to claim spots in standing sections close to the stage. A pop-up tour merchandise store opened in a parking lot by the stadium that morning. Zachary Hourihane, who co-hosts a Swift podcast called “Evolution of a Snake” and posts YouTube and TikTok videos under the name Swiftologist, said it’s too soon to know whether the singer will retain her honorary citizenship or part ways with London. As her fans know all too well, only time will tell with Taylor. Hourihane notes that Swift started spending more time in London after a difficult year in which she went from winning album of the year at the 2016 Grammy Awards for “1989” to seeing her popularity plummet amid a public feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. From his study of her life in England, he thinks the happy memories she created there come mixed with “a sense of isolation.” “There is a lot of nostalgia that might have turned into regret,” Hourihane said. “She felt like she was trapped there for a while.” Fast forward several boyfriends, 10 albums (including the Taylor’s Version re-records ) and the Eras Tour juggernaut, and it’s not surprising her life is up for reappraisal. Hourihane suspects Swift is “not quite ready to give up on London” for both practical and artistic reasons. “Taylor is someone who retraces her steps a lot. Things are never really over with her. She likes to revisit things that have finished,” he said. “Let’s be realistic about it. Her relationship, even if it is, ‘so long, goodbye,’ she has good reason to be in London and good money to make there.”",

It’s not like there is an American football player living here,” said Maggie Fekete, 22, a Canadian graduate student who credits the London references in Swift’s music with orienting her when she moved to the city three years ago. “I think there will be a lot less London in her music, which is sad.” Stella Elgood, 25, of London, said Friday she assumed Swift would sing “So long, London” at some point during her eight nights in the city but that Swift “will always be welcome.” “Especially since she dated Harry Styles, she’s been here in the Zeitgeist,” Elgood said. For those who haven’t been paying attention, Swift had a series of romances with famous British citizens (including Styles in 2012) that ended last year, when she started dating Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. The speculation surrounding “So Long, London” and a mournful companion song that mentions a London pub, “The Black Dog,” stems from the 2023 breakup of Swift and English actor Joe Alwyn, who were together for over six years. Alwyn is assumed to have inspired “London Boy,” a song from her 2019 album “Lover.” A special-edition “Lover” CD included what appeared to be a January 2017 diary entry in which Swift talked about being “essentially based in London” but trying to lay low. British tabloids later reported that Swift spent much of the COVID-19 pandemic sheltering with Alwyn in north London. The Sun newspaper reported in December that the multiple Grammy-winner had bought a large property in the area and was remodeling it to be her base in Europe. After Swift released “The Tortured Poets Department” last month, however, a writer for the British edition of ELLE magazine observed that Londoners had an opening “for an all-American A-lister who can slot into her place in our collective consciousness.” “We had Swift before we lost her to her record-breaking, box office-breaking Eras Tour and now, it would appear that her vacant position has been filled by Zendaya,” writer Naomi May playfully posited before listing the various locations the American actor had been spotted with her longtime boyfriend, British actor Tom Holland. Either way, the capital is putting on quite a show of its own to make sure Swift and her fans feel appreciated. Guides are offering walking, bus and taxi tours that retrace her footsteps, including a kebab shop whose owner says his establishment is supplying sandwiches for the singer and her crew on Friday. Before the end of August, Swifties can partake in a full diet of Swift-themed brunches and dance parties, or ride the London Eye Ferris wheel accompanied by a string quartet playing her music. Souvenir stalls in Camden Market, one of the places mentioned in “London Boy,” stocked up on Swift-specific caps, T-shirts, bags and stickers in preparation. “We’re very proud that London is hosting more shows than any other city on Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour, a real testament to her love for London,” Laura Citron, CEO of tourism agency London & Partners, said. Fans started lining up outside Wembley on Thursday in hopes of being among the first ticket-holders to claim spots in standing sections close to the stage. Zachary Hourihane, who co-hosts a Swift podcast called “Evolution of a Snake” and posts YouTube and TikTok videos under the name Swiftologist, said it’s too soon to know whether the singer will retain her honorary citizenship or part ways with London. As her fans know all too well, only time will tell with Taylor. Hourihane notes that Swift started spending more time in London after a difficult year in which she went from winning album of the year at the 2016 Grammy Awards for “1989” to seeing her popularity plummet amid a public feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. From his study of her life in England, he thinks the happy memories she created there come mixed with “a sense of isolation.” “There is a lot of nostalgia that might have turned into regret,” Hourihane said. “She felt like she was trapped there for a while.” Fast forward several boyfriends, 10 albums (including the Taylor’s Version re-records ) and the Eras Tour juggernaut, and it’s not surprising her life is up for reappraisal. Hourihane suspects Swift is “not quite ready to give up on London” for both practical and artistic reasons. “Taylor is someone who retraces her steps a lot. Things are never really over with her. She likes to revisit things that have finished,” he said. “Let’s be realistic about it. Her relationship, even if it is, ‘so long, goodbye,’ she has good reason to be in London and good money to make there.”",

                    "text": "Taylor Swift and Gracie Abrams had an interesting time co-writing their latest song, “Us,” and it showed in a new video shared by Gracie, 24, to Instagram. In one of two clips, both artists were working on the lyrics and music to their new song, while another video revealed a hilarious moment with Taylor, 34, struggling to use a fire extinguisher. “Writing this entire song from 2am to 6am was some of the most fun I’ve ever had in my life,” Gracie captioned her carousel post on Friday, June 21. “@taylorswift now we know how to use a fire extinguisher. I love you.” In the hilarious video, Taylor was seen in a kitchen trying to figure out how to properly extinguish a small fire, which was visible on the table in the center of the room. View this post on Instagram “Wait, what do I do about this?” the “Karma” singer asked in the clip. “So, I cut this with a knife? I think we’re gonna die.” While struggling to press down on the handle, a frustrated Taylor could be heard muttering the word, “Bitch,” until she managed to finally put out the fire, which apparently ruined their purses that were on the table. However, Taylor and Gracie seemed to get a good laugh out of the moment. “Our purses are ruined. And my shoes. And the whole room, I think,” Taylor said at the end of the video while managing to smile. Although their night nearly ended in a fiery blaze, Taylor and Gracie were able to release their new song, which is from Gracie’s sophomore album, The Secret of Us. The duet features a low and dark tone, as they both sing in the chorus, “Do you miss us, us? / I felt it, you held it, do you miss us, us? / Wonder if you regret the secret of us, us.” In addition to their new song, Gracie has also worked with Taylor in the past. Last year, the “Mess it Up” artist was Taylor’s opening act on her Eras Tour in the spring and over the summer.",

                    "text": "Taylor Swift and Gracie Abrams pulled on our collective heartstrings when they worked together on “Us,” featured on the latter’s 13-track sophomore studio album The Secret of Us that was released on Friday (June 21). Upon the release of the project, Abrams took to Instagram to share a video of the duo playfully creating the song while pulling an all-nighter during a girls’ night, calling the evening “some of the most fun I’ve ever had in my life.” She also included a video of Swift extinguishing an apartment fire as the duo broke out into hysterical laughter. “Now we know how to use a fire extinguisher. I love you,” Abrams wrote. Abrams previously told Billboard that the talented duo heard the candle fall over earlier in the evening, but Taylor had thought it was one of her cats making noise. Swift put out the fire with the extinguisher before anyone was hurt. “She was such a legend,” she recalled. “I don’t know how at this hour or in our state she knew what to do.” She added, “We both had an insane cough from the fire extinguisher fumes for weeks.” The 24-year-old Abrams spent the summer opening for Swift’s The Eras Tour, a role she’ll reprise on select dates in North America later this fall. She’ll head out on her very own headlining tour of theater-sized venues across the United States, starting Sept. 5 in Portland. The Secret of Us features the previously-released tracks “Risk” and “Close to You,” which debuted at No. 49 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and it’s the followup to Abrams’ debut record Good Riddance, which arrived February 2023, peaking at No. 52 on the Billboard 200.",

                    "text": "Darling, everything’s on fire — but Taylor Swift can put it out. In a video shared by Gracie Abrams commemorating their new collaboration “Us,” the “Down Bad” singer fumbles around with a fire extinguisher before successfully dousing the flames. As far as she’s concerned, it’s not a worthwhile kitchen to burn. “Writing this entire song from 2am to 6am is some of the most fun I’ve ever had in my life,” Abrams wrote on Instagram. “Now we know how to use a fire extinguisher.” The video sees Swift perplexed by a small flame on a countertop in a kitchen. “What do I do about this?” she asks while holding a fire extinguisher. “I think we’re gonna die!” she jokes. Swift finally gets the extinguisher to erupt with a stream of retardant, and she and Abrams are both surprised by the sudden force of the device, which sprays everywhere. “Our purses are ruined, and my shoes, and the whole room I think,” Swift says of the objects that sat on the counter. Fittingly, “Us” features lyrical fire that reflects the duo’s late-night mishap (as in, they literally sing about flames — whether the song itself is fire is for you to decide). “And if history's clear, the flames always end up in ashes/And what seemed like fate, give it ten months and you'll be past,” Swift and Abrams sing on the song’s chorus. Want more movie news? Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free newsletter to get the latest trailers, celebrity interviews, film reviews, and more. “Us” is the fifth track on Abrams’ sophomore album The Secrets of Us (no relation to Swift’s “The Story of Us”), which released Friday. Both of the singer’s LPs are almost entirely produced and co-written by Aaron Dessner, the National instrumentalist who collaborated with Swift on Folklore, Evermore, and The Tortured Poets Department. Fellow Swift collaborator Jack Antonoff also contributed to “Us” as a producer. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Abrams noted her enthusiasm for working with Swift. “When I was little, I used to pretend that [writing with Swift] was happening, like imaginary-friend-style in my head,” she said. “[The fact] we have something tangible that we made together that I personally f---ing love so much is beyond me.” Abrams, who is the daughter of filmmaker J.J. Abrams, opened for Swift at 17 shows during the North American leg of the Eras Tour last year, and will double that number when the “Fortnight” singer returns to the states at the end of 2024. Abrams also told EW that the impending return to the Eras stage helped motivate her to perfect her second album. “I think knowing that we had more Eras dates this year, that was also a real driving force behind wanting to make something that just had the chance to explode a bit more for the audience,” she said. “I really wanted to make them feel more electrified by my set.”",

                    "text": "The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) plans to deny billions of dollars worth of improper claims for COVID-19 pandemic-era tax credits, it announced on June 20. The agency said in a press release that the planned rejections follow a detailed review that confirmed “widespread concerns about a large number of improper claims,” and provided new insight into what it defined as “risky” ERC activity. “We will now use this information to deny billions of dollars in clearly improper claims and begin additional work to issue payments to help taxpayers without any red flags on their claims,” IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said. The ERC refundable tax credit, also called the Employee Retention Tax Credit or ERTC, was created by Congress in March 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic and was meant to help businesses retain employees during government-imposed lockdowns. According to the IRS, aggressive marketing and promotions last year led to many people being “misled” into filing for the ERC. As a result of the flood of claims, the agency announced a moratorium last fall on processing claims submitted after September 14, 2023, to allow time to study around 1 million claims and determine how many were genuine. “These complex claims take time, and the IRS remains deeply concerned about how many taxpayers have been misled and deluded by promoters into thinking they’re eligible for a big payday. The reality is many aren’t,” Mr. Werfel said. According to the IRS, agents reviewing claims identified that between 10 percent and 20 percent of them fall into what the agency has determined to be the “highest-risk group.” Another 60 percent to 70 percent of the claims show an “unacceptable risk” of being improper and will need to be further evaluated, according to the IRS. Between 10 percent and 20 percent of the ERC claims show a “low risk.” In those cases, where there are no eligibility warning signs and the IRS received the claims before last fall’s moratorium, the agency will begin judiciously processing more of those claims, it said. The first payments for that group of employers will likely begin later this summer, according to the agency, although it stressed that those payments will “go out at a dramatically slower pace than payments that went out during the pandemic period given the need for increased scrutiny.” In the meantime, the moratorium on ERC claims submitted after Sept. 14, 2023, will continue. “This is one of the most complex credits the IRS has administered, and we continue to ask taxpayers for patience as we unravel this complex process,” Mr. Werfel added. “Ultimately, this period will help us protect taxpayers against improper payouts that flooded the system and get checks to those truly eligible.”",

Enacted to support small businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic, the employee retention credit, or ERC, is worth thousands of dollars per eligible employee. However, the agency stopped processing new filings in September amid a surge of \"questionable claims,\" the IRS said in a news release. The agency added that it will extend that moratorium. After investigating more than 1 million claims worth roughly $86 billion, the IRS said in the release that it identified 10% to 20% of the highest-risk filings, and \"tens of thousands\" will be rejected in the coming weeks, according to the agency. Another 60% to 70% of claims with an \"unacceptable level of risk\" will be further examined, the IRS said. \"We will now use this information to deny billions of dollars in clearly improper claims and begin additional work to issue payments to help taxpayers without any red flags on their claims,\" IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement.

Overall, compliance efforts for erroneous ERC claims have topped more than $2 billion since last fall, the IRS said. \"This is one of the most complex credits the IRS has administered, and we continue to ask taxpayers for patience as we unravel this complex process,\" Werfel said. \"Ultimately, this period will help us protect taxpayers against improper payouts that flooded the system and get checks to those truly eligible.\"",

                    "text": "When it comes to new movies and TV shows to stream, not all weekends are created equal. June has already played host to new seasons of Bridgerton, The Boys and House of the Dragon, but this week’s crop of on-demand arrivals is decidedly less compelling. Leading the charge is Trigger Warning on Netflix – a new action-packed thriller starring Jessica Alba – while Federer: Twelve Final Days and Perfect Wife: The Mysterious Disappearance of Sherri Papini come to Prime Video and Hulu, respectively. Elsewhere, Five Nights at Freddy's makes its UK streaming debut on Sky and Now. Below, we've rounded up the biggest new movies and TV shows to stream on Netflix, Prime Video, Max, and more this weekend. Trigger Warning (Netflix) If you’re in the mood for a paint-by-numbers action thriller this weekend, Netflix (aka the world’s best streaming service) has you covered with Trigger Warning. The new Netflix movie stars Jessica Alba as a Special Forces commando-turned-barkeeper whose military skills come in handy when a violent gang starts to run rampant in her hometown. Mark Webber, Gabriel Basso and Anthony Michael Hall also star. IndieWire's David Ehrlich described Trigger Warning as “lifeless and instantly forgettable” (ouch!), but if you’re just looking for a way to switch your mind off for a few hours, this could do the trick. Now available to stream on Netflix. Five Nights at Freddy's (Sky, NOW) Having debuted on Peacock in the US way back in October, Five Nights at Freddy's is now finally streaming on Sky and Now in the UK. This feature-length adaptation of the hit horror videogame series stars Josh Hutcherson as a troubled security guard whose routine night shift at a once-successful, now-abandoned pizzeria is disturbed by a group of murderous animatronics. Five Nights at Freddy's was produced by the same team behind M3GAN, The Black Phone and The Invisible Man, so expect plenty of blood-curdling surprises. Now available to stream on Sky and NOW in the UK. Black Barbie (Netflix) Arriving hot on the heels of the biggest film of 2023 (remember the one starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling?) is Black Barbie on Netflix. This feature-length documentary – which comes from Shonda Rhimes’ Shondaland production company – tells the little-known story of three trailblazing women at Mattel who created the first Black Barbie. Expect talking heads and eye-opening archival footage. Now available to stream on Netflix. Perfect Wife: The Mysterious Disappearance of Sherri Papini (Hulu) The second of several documentaries on this week’s list of recommendations is Perfect Wife: The Mysterious Disappearance of Sherri Papini on Hulu. This three-episode true crime series recounts the Gone Girl-style case of a supposedly devoted mother, Sherri Papini, who faked her own kidnapping and torture in 2016. Vanity Fair's Eve Batey described Perfect Wife as “the wildest true-crime case you’ve never heard of,” so genre fans should definitely consider this best Hulu show contender. UK viewers will have to wait until later in the year to catch it, though. Now available to stream on Hulu in the US. Federer: Twelve Final Days (Prime Video) This week’s factual Prime Video offering is Federer: Twelve Final Days. Originally a home video that was never intended for public viewing, this feature-length film – directed by celebrated Amy and Senna filmmaker Asif Kapadia – chronicles the final 12 days of Roger Federer’s professional tennis career. Featuring interviews from numerous rivals and friends, including Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray, Federer: Twelve Final Days has been described in one review by The Hindu as a “rudimentary yet nostalgic account of a sporting legend’s swansong,” so Federer fans – or indeed tennis fans, period – won’t want to miss this one. Now available to stream on Prime Video. The Accidental Twins (Netflix) Joining Trigger Warning and Black Barbie on Netflix this weekend is new feature-length documentary The Accidental Twins. This hard-to-believe story centers on the complex history and new identities of two sets of identical twins who were switched at birth (yes, switched at birth!) in Colombia. Critics haven’t yet had a chance to praise or lambast The Accidental Twins, but the film’s synopsis suggests it could be among the best Netflix documentaries of the year so far. Now available to stream on Netflix. Slave Play. Not a Movie. A Play. (Max) Jeremy O. Harris’ celebrated Broadway production Slave Play gets the behind the scenes treatment on Max this weekend. Slave Play. Not a Movie. A Play. lifts the veil on the creative process that enabled Harris able to craft such an incendiary and genre-bending show, following the playwright as he encounters new actors and refines his script ahead of a tension-laden opening night. Now available to stream on Max. For more streaming coverage, check out our guides on the best Disney Plus movies, best Netflix films, new Prime Video movies and new Max films.",

                    "text": "It was a reunion of two icons. Comedy giants and longtime friends Carol Burnett, 91, and Dick Van Dyke, 98 — both still going strong in their ninth decade — reunited on the red carpet Thursday. In photos, they look like they’re in high spirits, hugging and sharing smiles. They were gathered to celebrate as Burnett left her hand and footprints in cement at Hollywood’s TCL Chinese Theatre – joining past Hollywood stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Sidney Poitier, and Van Dyke’s “Mary Poppins” co-star Julie Andrews. Van Dyke’s prints were also there, as he left them in 1966. Burnett joked around, pretending her hands got stuck in the cement. “I can’t begin to count the times that my grandmother and I would walk up here to the Grauman’s Chinese — that’s what it was called then — and look at all the footprints and handprints of all these great movie stars,” Burnett said in her speech. She added, “Betty Grable was one of my favorites, and I remember bending down and putting my hands on her handprints, never dreaming that someday I’d be putting my hands here… 80 years later.” Van Dyke has appeared in 11 episodes of “The Carol Burnett Show,” which aired from 1967 to 1978. The “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” star was there to toast and support his friend. Other celebs there included Laura Dern, Bob Odenkirk, and Jimmy Kimmel, who all spoke during the ceremony. Bill Hader, Allison Janney, Jane Lynch, Maya Rudolph and Lisa Ann Walter also attended. Van Dyke was photographed dropping his cane at the event. He looked unfazed, smiling at the crowd, as Dern bent down to help him pick it up. Later, he posed for photos with Burnett, who looked emotional to reunite with her old friend, as she linked arms with him. Both Van Dyke and Burnett were all smiles. The event marked the latest accolade for Burnett, in her long and storied career. Burnett, who is currently in AppleTV’s “Palm Royale,” has also gotten a slew of Emmys and Golden Globes, among other awards. Van Dyke is also still working, lending his voice to a 2023 episode of “The Simpsons.” He also became the oldest Daytime Emmy winner in history, when he took home a trophy for a “Days of Our Lives” role on June 7. “I don’t believe this. I feel like a spy from nighttime television,” he said at the time. “I’m 98 years old. Can you believe it? This really tops off a lifetime of 80 years in the business. If I had known I would have lived this long I would’ve taken better care of myself.” After the ceremony, Burnett told “Entertainment Tonight” that it was “so lovely” to see all of the people who showed up to celebrate her. She gushed that “what touches” her the most is when fans tell her that her show “cheered me up.”",

                    "text": "Old friends. Carol Burnett reunited with Dick Van Dyke during her handprint ceremony at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood on Thursday. The “Carol Burnett Show” star, 91, had her feet and hands plastered into the pavement outside the famed movie palace while her former co-star, 98, cheered her on. The nonagenarians happily posed for photos together, including one with Burnett’s legendary costume designer, Bob Mackie. Van Dyke often appeared on the CBS variety show, which ran for 11 seasons from 1967 to 1978, and has remained close friends with its comedic namesake throughout their incredible careers. Burnett’s “Palm Royale” co-stars Laura Dern and Allison Janney also attended the ceremony along with Bill Hader, Jimmy Kimmel, Jane Lynch, Lisa Ann Walter and Maya Rudolph. Kimmel, who spoke at the event, shared his gratitude in an Instagram post later in the day. “Thank you Carol Burnett for giving me the honor of honoring you at your exceptionally well-deserved and long overdue handprint & footprint ceremony this morning in Hollywood,” the “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” host, 56, wrote. When Burnett spoke to Page Six last year in honor of her milestone 90th birthday, she confessed to not feeling her age. “I feel like I’m 11!” she exclaimed, adding that she was thrilled to still be working. “I’m just so fortunate, at this age, to be able to be getting in the sandbox and playing with people,” she said. The TV icon also shared that she did not believe her groundbreaking show could be made now. “We had a 28-piece live orchestra, we had 12 dancers, we had two guest stars a week and Bob Mackie designed — get this — 60 to 75 costumes a week, everything everybody wore in all the sketches and all the musical numbers, on and on and on,” she told us. “And no network today would spend that kind of money. The money that it would cost today would be astronomical. So they’re not gonna go for it.” Burnett acknowledged that “there are many people who could do a variety show” today, though she made sure to note, “They couldn’t do what we did because of the cost. That’s the problem. That’s why there aren’t any shows like ours or Dean Martin or any of those, you know, just can’t happen today.” Van Dyke has not shown any signs of slowing down either. Earlier this month, he became the oldest Daytime Emmy winner, snagging an award for a guest spot on “Days of Our Lives.”",

                    "text": "Joe Biden’s administration has banned Russia-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky from providing its popular antivirus products in the US over national security concerns. “Kaspersky will generally no longer be able to, among other activities, sell its software within the United States or provide updates to software already in use,” said a commerce department statement. The announcement came after a lengthy investigation found Kaspersky’s “continued operations in the United States presented a national security risk due to the Russian government’s offensive cyber capabilities and capacity to influence or direct Kaspersky’s operations”. The US commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, said: “Russia has shown time and again they have the capability and intent to exploit Russian companies, like Kaspersky Lab, to collect and weaponise sensitive US information.” Kaspersky, in a statement to AFP, said the commerce department “made its decision based on the present geopolitical climate and theoretical concerns” and vowed to “pursue all legally available options to preserve its current operations and relationships”. “Kaspersky does not engage in activities which threaten US national security and, in fact, has made significant contributions with its reporting and protection from a variety of threat actors that targeted US interests and allies,” the company said. The move is the first such action taken since an executive order issued under Donald Trump’s presidency gave the commerce department the power to investigate whether certain companies pose a national security risk. Raimondo said the commerce department’s actions demonstrated to America’s adversaries that it would not hesitate to act when “their technology poses a risk to the United States and its citizens”. While Kaspersky is headquartered in Moscow, it has offices in 31 countries around the world, servicing more than 400 million users and 270,000 corporate clients in more than 200 countries, the commerce department said. As well as banning the sale of Kaspersky’s antivirus software, the commerce department also added three entities linked to the firm to a list of companies deemed to be a national security concern, “for their cooperation with Russian military and intelligence authorities in support of the Russian government’s cyber intelligence objectives”. The commerce department said it “strongly encouraged” users to switch to new vendors, although its decision does not ban them from using the software should they choose to do so. Kaspersky is allowed to continue certain operations in the US, including providing antivirus updates, until 29 September this year, “in order to minimise disruption to US consumers and businesses and to give them time to find suitable alternatives”, it added.",

                    "text": "Sales of software by Russia security giant Kaspersky Lab will be banned in the US, the Biden administration has declared. Kaspersky Labs was widely known as a major player in the cybersecurity industry, leading the way across the consumer and business markets. However, since Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the wider war between Ukraine and Russia, Kaspersky has increasingly lost its reputation in the West amid concerns that the company could be passing sensitive information to Russian intelligence services. Genuine or geopolitical concerns? Among the main concerns cited by the Biden administration are in the privileged levels of access granted to Kaspersky solutions that could be used to commit sabotage and espionage against western computer systems, especially as some Kaspersky solutions are used to protect critical infrastructure at both local and state levels. Speaking on the announcement, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said, “Russia has shown it has the capacity and ... the intent to exploit Russian companies like Kaspersky to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans and that is why we are compelled to take the action that we are taking today.” Kaspersky responded to the announcement stating that the company did not pose a threat to US national security, and that the company will be pursuing legal routes to continue operating in the US. Democratic Senator Mark Warner, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said “We would never give an adversarial nation the keys to our networks or devices, so it's crazy to think that we would continue to allow Russian software with the deepest possible device access to be sold to Americans.” The ban will come into force on the 29th of September, and from this date the download, update, licensing and resale of Kaspersky products will be banned. Products that integrate Kaspersky software will also be banned. This deadline gives companies the opportunity to find alternative solutions, so it may be worth taking a look at the best SMB firewall or the best business VPNs. The US has made a number of allegations against Kaspersky’s links to Russian intelligence, including allegations that Kaspersky Lab passed hacking tools to the Russian government after stealing them from a US National Security Agency worker.

                    "text": "The U.S. Department of Commerce banned Russian company Kaspersky from selling its anti-virus software and other cybersecurity products in the country after determining that the firm posed an “undue or unacceptable risk to national security.” “Kaspersky will generally no longer be able to, among other activities, sell its software within the United States or provide updates to software already in use,” the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) said in a June 20 press release. The prohibition is applicable to Kaspersky Lab, Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab. The company’s operations were deemed to be risky to the United States “due to the Russian Government’s offensive cyber capabilities and capacity to influence or direct Kaspersky’s operations.” Such risks could not be dealt with simply through mitigation strategies, which made a total prohibition the only choice left to ensure national interests remain protected, the BIS stated. Specifically, the BIS determined that Kaspersky was subject to the Russian government’s jurisdiction, which forces it to comply with information requests from Moscow. This could lead to personal information stored on devices with the company’s anti-virus software getting into the hands of Russian authorities. “Kaspersky has broad access to, and administrative privileges over, customer information through the provision of cybersecurity and anti-virus software. Kaspersky employees could potentially transfer U.S. customer data to Russia, where it would be accessible to the Russian Government under Russian law,” the BIS said. “Kaspersky does not engage in activities which threaten U.S. national security and, in fact, has made significant contributions with its reporting and protection from a variety of threat actors that targeted U.S. interests and allies.” The BIS found that Kaspersky also has the power to install malicious software on its customer’s computers or to selectively deny updates. This could leave American citizens and U.S. critical infrastructure vulnerable to malware attacks, the BIS said. Kaspersky’s software is also integrated into third-party products and services. As such, people who use such third-party products could unknowingly introduce Kaspersky’s programs into their devices or networks, thus potentially compromising their personal data, BIS stated. Kaspersky said it has implemented “significant transparency measures” to ensure the company’s trustworthiness. Such measures are “unmatched” by any of the company’s peers in the cybersecurity industry. The Commerce Department’s ban “unfairly ignores the evidence,” the company said. Such operations include providing anti-virus signature updates and codebase updates. The agency claims this gives Americans enough time to find suitable alternatives. “Russia has shown time and again they have the capability and intent to exploit Russian companies, like Kaspersky Lab, to collect and weaponize sensitive U.S. information, and we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to safeguard U.S. national security and the American people,” said Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. According to the BIS, Kaspersky Labs Limited from the United Kingdom as well as AO Kaspersky Lab and OOO Kaspersky Group from Russia have been added to the Entity List “for their cooperation with Russian military and intelligence authorities in support of the Russian Government’s cyber intelligence objectives.” In April, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an emergency directive that asked federal agencies to take necessary steps to mitigate Midnight Blizzard, a Russian state-sponsored actor that accessed the email accounts. Jen Easterly, director of CISA, said the “U.S. government has documented malicious cyber activity as a standard part of the Russian playbook” for several years, “This latest compromise of Microsoft adds to their long list.” The report called for the creation of an independent cyberservice for the U.S. military alongside the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and Space Force. The Epoch Times reached out to the Russian Embassy for comment on the Kaspersky ban.",

                    "text": "Jose Antuna fell through a drain at a west suburban car wash where he worked and tore his meniscus in mid-November. The 40-year-old from Venezuela didn’t have a work permit at the time and was making $10 an hour. But after being injured for a second time in May while working at a flea market — this time as an innocent bystander when a woman allegedly attempted to run her car into her adulterous husband — he can barely walk around his apartment. He struggles to load himself onto CTA buses for his physical therapy appointments. He spends his days sitting or sleeping, watching his 3-year-old daughter, Luz, run around his apartment. In Illinois, it is illegal under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 to knowingly hire workers who are in the country without legal permission. However, these workers are as entitled to workers’ compensation benefits when injured on the job as people who are citizens. “It’s hard. I don’t have a way to pay for rent right now,” Antuna said in Spanish. “I’m worried my family will be kicked out of my apartment.” Immigrants who can’t work legally are more likely to work higher-risk jobs and less likely to know how to access protection if they need it, advocates say. While experts say that there is no way to officially track how many workers’ compensation cases from migrants have been filed, with more than 43,000 migrants who have passed through Chicago in almost two years, some workers’ compensation lawyers say they have seen an increase in migrant cases. “They still have virtually the same workers’ compensation rights as every other worker,” said Brian Hercule, the worker’s compensation and personal injury attorney representing Antuna. “It falls on the employer to be to take responsibility for their employees.” A slow process Living paycheck to paycheck, Antuna looked online and found an attorney to help him file a work compensation claim against the car wash. He told his boss he was moving forward with a claim. But he said his boss went to his eldest daughter’s house in Chicago and tried to bully her so that her father wouldn’t move forward with it. “My daughter called me desperately, he had gone there, had threatened her,” Antuna said. Hercule largely represents immigrants. He said that in the 14 years he’s been practicing, he’s consistently seen employers who try to use a person’s immigration status against them. Because Antuna’s case is still pending, Hercule could not provide any more specifics. But he said the process can take months or even years to resolve, depending on the nature of the injury and the amount of treatment a person is getting. “It’s a slow process, unfortunately,” he said. With the help of the workers’ compensation firm, Antuna started going to physical therapy. Workers who have filed for compensation are supposed to receive temporary, weekly wage replacement benefits during the period in which they’re being treated, and then more once the case is closed. But that weekly rate is typically less than what they actually make, according to Jose Rivero, a longtime workers’ compensation attorney. Rivero, who used to do work compensation cases with immigrant farmworkers, said he believes many Venezuelans are scared to come forward. This worries him. “You have one body. This is it. And you’ve got to treat it because this is what is making you money,” he said. For five months, Antuna slowly recuperated his knee to a point where he could walk again. His orthopedic surgeon cleared him to return to work on March 21, according to medical records. ‘The only breadwinner’ Venezuelans escaping economic ruin and government prosecution in their country of origin have accounted for many of the arrivals in Chicago. Unlike immigrants from Mexico and Central America who have come to the United States in the past, most Venezuelans do not have a network of support. “I’m the only breadwinner of my family here in Chicago,” Antuna said. Antuna was a welder in Venezuela before his company folded under the country’s far-left president, Nicolás Maduro. Antuna said after he was laid off, he moved home and started raising pigs at his house in the central western state of Yaracuy. He signed a contract with the federal government, under the impression that he could sell his pigs at subsidized prices in exchange for material goods to keep his farm going. But he said the government took all of his pigs and didn’t provide the benefits it had agreed upon. Officials came to his little farm three times and demanded more from him each time. When he refused, he said they retaliated. “The third time, they hit my wife. She had my daughter in her arms,” he said. “They took everything. Everything I had worked for. Me quitaron todo.” He and his wife filed a report against the government, which didn’t sit favorably with officials. They were facing death threats from the government, he said. Antuna’s family, at the urging of his mother, had to leave their home. He left behind his mother and godfather, his grandkids and siblings, and everything they knew. ‘I wish I could just have avoided all of this’ Antuna’s family arrived in Chicago in late July and was staying at the Inn of Chicago in Streeterville when the first injury occurred later that November while working at the car wash, he said. After months of healing, he was eager to save up to pay for housing on his own. In March, Antuna started working at a stand in the Swap-O-Rama flea market in the Back of the Yards neighborhood. He worked for a friend, he said, and would take two buses to get there in the morning. “I was feeling pain, but I could still walk. I could work,” he said. He and his family moved into an apartment in Chicago Lawn in late April with a state-funded grant. He said he was heading in the right direction. He had a stable job. His wife and daughter were getting used to the neighborhood. But on May 25 around 5:30 p.m., his boss’s wife — who had recently found out that her husband was cheating on her — got into her car in a fit of jealousy. Antuna was standing in the parking lot between the couple. According to a police report, she was trying to “either hit or scare” her husband. But she allegedly turned the wheel abruptly and hit Antuna instead, in the same knee he had injured months earlier. Antuna was transferred to Holy Cross Hospital and officers opened an investigation. When he left the hospital, he was on crutches. He was back to square one — frantically looking for legal solutions and recourse. His boss at Swap-O-Rama stopped answering his calls. He requested video footage of the incident from the Swap-O-Rama manager but got no response. “I wish I could just have avoided all of this,” he said, crying. The Tribune reached out to a Swap-O-Rama spokesperson, but didn’t receive a response. Moving forward Antuna knew he had no choice but to move forward. He found a second lawyer for his latest injuries and started a new round of physical therapy. Taylor Unterberg, the personal injury attorney handling Antuna’s new case at Swap-O-Rama, said the car accident, classified as aggravated battery, is a pending civil and criminal matter. Unterberg could provide no other details other than that person injury cases typically take months to finish. “Until someone is done with treatment, or at the very end of treatment, we can’t place a value on a case,” she said. While his cases are ongoing, Antuna passes his days resting his knee and attending his physical therapy appointments in Logan Square. The two buses to get there take over an hour. He worries about meeting his monthly rental payments. His wife has had little success looking for work, and she also has to help him care for their toddler. When he calls the police station to check on the status of the investigation, there is rarely anyone there who speaks Spanish. Unterberg said that while she does not ask for the immigration status of her clients, she has seen more Spanish-speaking people in her practice over the past few years. Out of the firm’s 23 employees, only about four or five speak Spanish. Nicole Hallett, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School, said Antuna likely qualifies for a U visa, which allows crime victims and certain family members to apply for lawful permanent residence after three years. But this requires someone like Antuna to know how to apply. “It’s really important that police departments make information available for noncitizens so that they know to make the request,” Hallett said. At some point, while he waits for his second case to wrap up, Antuna believes it’s likely he’ll have to beg on the street. “My dream, everything I had hoped and planned for in the United States, it all went away with this accident,” he said, on a recent bus trip to therapy. On the way there, he adjusted his leg on the bus and flinched. He called the police and asked for a Spanish speaker. They hung up on him. nsalzman@chicagotribune.com",

Unterberg could provide no other details other than that person injury cases typically take months to finish. “Until someone is done with treatment, or at the very end of treatment, we can’t place a value on a case,” she said. While his cases are ongoing, Antuna passes his days resting his knee and attending his physical therapy appointments in Logan Square. The two buses to get there take over an hour.He worries about meeting his monthly rental payments. His wife has had little success looking for work, and she also has to help him care for their toddler. When he calls the police station to check on the status of the investigation, there is rarely anyone there who speaks Spanish. Unterberg said that while she does not ask for the immigration status of her clients, she has seen more Spanish-speaking people in her practice over the past few years. Out of the firm’s 23 employees, only about four or five speak Spanish. Nicole Hallett, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School, said Antuna likely qualifies for a U visa, which allows crime victims and certain family members to apply for lawful permanent residence after three years. But this requires someone like Antuna to know how to apply. “It’s really important that police departments make information available for noncitizens so that they know to make the request,” Hallett said. At some point, while he waits for his second case to wrap up, Antuna believes it’s likely he’ll have to beg on the street. “My dream, everything I had hoped and planned for in the United States, it all went away with this accident,” he said, on a recent bus trip to therapy. On the way there, he adjusted his leg on the bus and flinched. He called the police and asked for a Spanish speaker. They hung up on him. nsalzman@chicagotribune.com",

                    "text": "Jose Antuna fell through a drain at a west suburban car wash where he worked and tore his meniscus in mid-November. The 40-year-old from Venezuela didn’t have a work permit at the time and was making $10 an hour. But after being injured for a second time in May while working at a flea market — this time as an innocent bystander when a woman allegedly attempted to run her car into her adulterous husband — he can barely walk around his apartment. He struggles to load himself onto CTA buses for his physical therapy appointments. He spends his days sitting or sleeping, watching his 3-year-old daughter, Luz, run around his apartment. In Illinois, it is illegal under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 to knowingly hire workers who are in the country without legal permission. However, these workers are as entitled to workers’ compensation benefits when injured on the job as people who are citizens.“It’s hard. I don’t have a way to pay for rent right now,” Antuna said in Spanish. “I’m worried my family will be kicked out of my apartment.”Immigrants who can’t work legally are more likely to work higher-risk jobs and less likely to know how to access protection if they need it, advocates say. While experts say that there is no way to officially track how many workers’ compensation cases from migrants have been filed, with more than 43,000 migrants who have passed through Chicago in almost two years, some workers’ compensation lawyers say they have seen an increase in migrant cases.“They still have virtually the same workers’ compensation rights as every other worker,” said Brian Hercule, the worker’s compensation and personal injury attorney representing Antuna. “It falls on the employer to be to take responsibility for their employees.” A slow process Living paycheck to paycheck, Antuna looked online and found an attorney to help him file a work compensation claim against the car wash. He told his boss he was moving forward with a claim. But he said his boss went to his eldest daughter’s house in Chicago and tried to bully her so that her father wouldn’t move forward with it. “My daughter called me desperately, he had gone there, had threatened her,” Antuna said. Hercule largely represents immigrants. He said that in the 14 years he’s been practicing, he’s consistently seen employers who try to use a person’s immigration status against them. Because Antuna’s case is still pending, Hercule could not provide any more specifics. But he said the process can take months or even years to resolve, depending on the nature of the injury and the amount of treatment a person is getting. “It’s a slow process, unfortunately,” he said. With the help of the workers’ compensation firm, Antuna started going to physical therapy. Workers who have filed for compensation are supposed to receive temporary, weekly wage replacement benefits during the period in which they’re being treated, and then more once the case is closed. But that weekly rate is typically less than what they actually make, according to Jose Rivero, a longtime workers’ compensation attorney.Rivero, who used to do work compensation cases with immigrant farmworkers, said he believes many Venezuelans are scared to come forward. This worries him.“You have one body. This is it. And you’ve got to treat it because this is what is making you money,” he said. For five months, Antuna slowly recuperated his knee to a point where he could walk again. His orthopedic surgeon cleared him to return to work on March 21, according to medical records. ‘The only breadwinner’ Venezuelans escaping economic ruin and government prosecution in their country of origin have accounted for many of the arrivals in Chicago. Unlike immigrants from Mexico and Central America who have come to the United States in the past, most Venezuelans do not have a network of support. “I’m the only breadwinner of my family here in Chicago,” Antuna said. Antuna was a welder in Venezuela before his company folded under the country’s far-left president, Nicolás Maduro. Antuna said after he was laid off, he moved home and started raising pigs at his house in the central western state of Yaracuy. He signed a contract with the federal government, under the impression that he could sell his pigs at subsidized prices in exchange for material goods to keep his farm going. But he said the government took all of his pigs and didn’t provide the benefits it had agreed upon. Officials came to his little farm three times and demanded more from him each time. When he refused, he said they retaliated. “The third time, they hit my wife. She had my daughter in her arms,” he said. “They took everything. Everything I had worked for. Me quitaron todo.” He and his wife filed a report against the government, which didn’t sit favorably with officials. They were facing death threats from the government, he said. Antuna’s family, at the urging of his mother, had to leave their home. He left behind his mother and godfather, his grandkids and siblings, and everything they knew. ‘I wish I could just have avoided all of this’ Antuna’s family arrived in Chicago in late July and was staying at the Inn of Chicago in Streeterville when the first injury occurred later that November while working at the car wash, he said. After months of healing, he was eager to save up to pay for housing on his own. In March, Antuna started working at a stand in the Swap-O-Rama flea market in the Back of the Yards neighborhood. He worked for a friend, he said, and would take two buses to get there in the morning. “I was feeling pain, but I could still walk. I could work,” he said.He and his family moved into an apartment in Chicago Lawn in late April with a state-funded grant. He said he was heading in the right direction. He had a stable job. His wife and daughter were getting used to the neighborhood.But on May 25 around 5:30 p.m., his boss’s wife — who had recently found out that her husband was cheating on her — got into her car in a fit of jealousy. Antuna was standing in the parking lot between the couple. According to a police report, she was trying to “either hit or scare” her husband. But she allegedly turned the wheel abruptly and hit Antuna instead, in the same knee he had injured months earlier. Antuna was transferred to Holy Cross Hospital and officers opened an investigation. When he left the hospital, he was on crutches. He was back to square one — frantically looking for legal solutions and recourse. His boss at Swap-O-Rama stopped answering his calls. He requested video footage of the incident from the Swap-O-Rama manager but got no response. “I wish I could just have avoided all of this,” he said, crying.The Tribune reached out to a Swap-O-Rama spokesperson, but didn’t receive a response. Moving forward Antuna knew he had no choice but to move forward. He found a second lawyer for his latest injuries and started a new round of physical therapy.Taylor Unterberg, the personal injury attorney handling Antuna’s new case at Swap-O-Rama, said the car accident, classified as aggravated battery, is a pending civil and criminal matter.

                    "text": "VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass. (AP) — Sheryl Taylor works as an administrator for Martha’s Vineyard Regional High School. Each summer, she has to leave the island or stay with friends because she can’t afford the high seasonal rents. How high? The average vacation home rents for $6,500 a week. “I have spent a significant amount of time couch surfing,” said Taylor, the school’s equity and access coordinator. “With my suitcase in my car, and moving one or two nights here and there with friends on the island.” Taylor’s plight reflects that of many on the Massachusetts island off Cape Cod. There are plenty of jobs, but restaurants and stores often can’t find enough staff because workers can’t afford to live there. Officials worry public safety is being compromised because they can’t retain or lure correctional officers or 911 dispatchers. Landlords stand to make far more money from short-term tourists than from year-round residents. Meanwhile, many island homes remain almost permanently vacant, their wealthy owners uninterested in renting them out between fleeting visits. A new report lays out in stark terms just how many low- and middle-income folks are being forced to move away from Martha’s Vineyard as its popularity with wealthy vacationers soars, causing the year-round population of 20,000 to swell up to tenfold over summer. In 2012, 40% of islanders earned less than $50,000 a year, the Martha’s Vineyard Commission housing report found. Ten years later, the figure had dropped to 23%. The proportion of people earning between $50,000 and $100,000 also fell over that time, while those earning more than $100,000 almost doubled to 46%. “So we’ve had a shift in our income distribution. This speaks to the fact that we’re losing year-round residents,” said Laura Silber, the island housing planner who wrote the report. “We’re losing our low- and moderate-income families. We’re losing our middle class, because we have no housing.” The report shows the average nightly rate among more than 3,000 short-term rentals is $931. And the average home price has more than doubled over the past 11 years to $2.3 million. Nearby Nantucket island is even more extreme, with the median home price reaching $3.55 million. Dukes County Sheriff Robert Ogden said the cost of housing has become a public safety issue on Martha’s Vineyard, with his agency unable to maintain the 11 or so 911 operators it needs to provide lifesaving information over the phone, such as CPR instructions. Operators who stay often get burned out from working too much overtime, he said. “It’s a vicious cycle,” Ogden said. “Every year, we’re losing two to three dispatchers because of not only the high cost of living here, but the insecurity of housing.” One trained correctional officer, he said, was forced to instead take cleaning jobs so she didn’t earn too much and lose her access to low-income housing. “Can you imagine, in any society, where you would say that I pay someone too much to stay on the job?” Ogden said. “How insane is that?” Ogden said he has been involved in an effort over the past six years to try to impose a local tax on home sales to help pay for affordable housing on the island, but it still requires new state legislation. Jason Merrill, who owns the Martha’s Vineyard Bike Rentals store, said people will often stop to ask him if he’s heard of any jobs that come with housing, or any housing options at all. “It’s definitely a point of contention here in the towns, and town hall meetings, that Airbnb is taking over,” Merrill said. Many workers, like painting laborer Abelardo Neto, can afford to stay on the island only by cramming together. He said he lives in a place with seven people. They each pay $850 a month in rent. Olda Deda, an Albanian visiting on a student work visa, said she works three jobs — at a coffee shop and two restaurants — and a big chunk of her wages goes toward her $900 monthly rent. It’s about three times higher than she would expect to pay in Europe, she said, and the housing costs came as a shock to her and many other seasonal workers. Ed Augustus, the state’s secretary of housing and livable communities, visited Martha’s Vineyard this month to hear directly from residents. “We’ve heard examples of folks who are coming in on the ferry every single day, sometimes from Falmouth, sometimes from further locations on the cape, sometimes from off cape,” Augustus said. The extra costs and time for travel are making jobs on the island less appealing or cost-effective. A sweeping housing bill that was approved by the state House this month would help, Augustus said. The bill contains $6.5 billion in bond authorizations, tax credits and policy initiatives and is aimed at supercharging the creation and renovation of affordable housing. Building on proposed legislation unveiled last year by Democratic Gov. Maura Healey, the bill still needs to be approved by the Senate. Until then, people like Taylor will need to keep figuring out how to survive the housing challenge.

                    "text": "VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass. (AP) — Sheryl Taylor works as an administrator for Martha’s Vineyard Regional High School. Each summer, she has to leave the island or stay with friends because she can’t afford the high seasonal rents. How high? The average vacation home rents for $6,500 a week. “I have spent a significant amount of time couch surfing,” said Taylor, the school’s equity and access coordinator. “With my suitcase in my car, and moving one or two nights here and there with friends on the island.” Taylor’s plight reflects that of many on the Massachusetts island off Cape Cod. There are plenty of jobs, but restaurants and stores often can’t find enough staff because workers can’t afford to live there. Officials worry public safety is being compromised because they can’t retain or lure correctional officers or 911 dispatchers. Landlords stand to make far more money from short-term tourists than from year-round residents. Meanwhile, many island homes remain almost permanently vacant, their wealthy owners uninterested in renting them out between fleeting visits. A new report lays out in stark terms just how many low- and middle-income folks are being forced to move away from Martha’s Vineyard as its popularity with wealthy vacationers soars, causing the year-round population of 20,000 to swell up to tenfold over summer. In 2012, 40% of islanders earned less than $50,000 a year, the Martha’s Vineyard Commission housing report found. Ten years later, the figure had dropped to 23%. The proportion of people earning between $50,000 and $100,000 also fell over that time, while those earning more than $100,000 almost doubled to 46%. “So we’ve had a shift in our income distribution. This speaks to the fact that we’re losing year-round residents,” said Laura Silber, the island housing planner who wrote the report. “We’re losing our low- and moderate-income families. We’re losing our middle class, because we have no housing.” The report shows the average nightly rate among more than 3,000 short-term rentals is $931. And the average home price has more than doubled over the past 11 years to $2.3 million. Nearby Nantucket island is even more extreme, with the median home price reaching $3.55 million. Dukes County Sheriff Robert Ogden said the cost of housing has become a public safety issue on Martha’s Vineyard, with his agency unable to maintain the 11 or so 911 operators it needs to provide lifesaving information over the phone, such as CPR instructions. Operators who stay often get burned out from working too much overtime, he said. “It’s a vicious cycle,” Ogden said. “Every year, we’re losing two to three dispatchers because of not only the high cost of living here, but the insecurity of housing.” One trained correctional officer, he said, was forced to instead take cleaning jobs so she didn’t earn too much and lose her access to low-income housing. “Can you imagine, in any society, where you would say that I pay someone too much to stay on the job?” Ogden said. “How insane is that?” Ogden said he has been involved in an effort over the past six years to try to impose a local tax on home sales to help pay for affordable housing on the island, but it still requires new state legislation. Jason Merrill, who owns the Martha’s Vineyard Bike Rentals store, said people will often stop to ask him if he’s heard of any jobs that come with housing, or any housing options at all. “It’s definitely a point of contention here in the towns, and town hall meetings, that Airbnb is taking over,” Merrill said. Many workers, like painting laborer Abelardo Neto, can afford to stay on the island only by cramming together. He said he lives in a place with seven people. They each pay $850 a month in rent. Olda Deda, an Albanian visiting on a student work visa, said she works three jobs — at a coffee shop and two restaurants — and a big chunk of her wages goes toward her $900 monthly rent. It’s about three times higher than she would expect to pay in Europe, she said, and the housing costs came as a shock to her and many other seasonal workers. Ed Augustus, the state’s secretary of housing and livable communities, visited Martha’s Vineyard this month to hear directly from residents. “We’ve heard examples of folks who are coming in on the ferry every single day, sometimes from Falmouth, sometimes from further locations on the cape, sometimes from off cape,” Augustus said. The extra costs and time for travel are making jobs on the island less appealing or cost-effective. A sweeping housing bill that was approved by the state House this month would help, Augustus said. The bill contains $6.5 billion in bond authorizations, tax credits and policy initiatives and is aimed at supercharging the creation and renovation of affordable housing. Building on proposed legislation unveiled last year by Democratic Gov. Maura Healey, the bill still needs to be approved by the Senate. Until then, people like Taylor will need to keep figuring out how to survive the housing challenge. She pays a huge amount to be at the school for a required two weeks over summer, she said, then come fall she faces all the costs associated with moving into a new rental.",

                    "text": "Megan Thee Stallion’s new album, Megan, is one day closer. Today, the Houston hottie shared the tracklist, revealing that the project will be 18 tracks long, with features from past collaborator GloRilla, Brooklyn drill rapper Kyle Ricch, R&B hitmaker Victoria Monét, Texas royalty UGK, and Japanese rapper Yuki Chiba. The snake motif that has unfurled over the past year continues, with “Boa,” “Cobra,” and “Hiss\\” joined by “Rattle” and “Mamushi,” which is the Japanese word for “snake.” As usual, Megan’s love for Japanese anime shines through, as well, with a track titled “Otaku Hot Girl” borrowing the Japanese term for “fans” or “nerds,” which was co-opted by American anime fans to refer to themselves. Meg recently updated the cover of the album in response to fans’ lukewarm reception of the original, butterfly-themed cover. She went back to her snake theme, using a photo of herself emerging from a giant egg covered in slime. During the tour promoting the album, Hot Girl Summer, Thee Stallion proved many of her haters wrong in saying she isn’t an arena artist, hanging out with WNBA stars like Angel Reese and Brittney Griner, and found herself upgraded to headliner on festivals like Lollapalooza and Outside Lands after Tyler The Creator dropped out. Megan is out 6/28 via Hot Girl Productions LLC. Find out more information here.",

On Friday, Megan revealed that her new album will include 16 songs, including collabs with Victoria Monét and a UGK reunion with Bun B and the late Pimp C. Also included on the album are rapper Kyle Ricch on “B.A.S,” Hot Girl Summer tour opener GloRilla (and “Wanna Be” collaborator) on “Accent,” and Japanese rapper Yuki Chiba, formerly known as Kohh, on “Mamushi.” Monét is on Track 13, “Spin,” while UGK are featured on “Paper Together.” “Which song you claiming hotties?” Megan wrote on Instagram sharing the track listing, which includes two images of her crawling out of an egg while covered in a yolk-like substance. Among the solo songs on the album are “Figueroa,” “Where Them Girls At,” and “Broke His Heart.” The LP also includes singles “Hiss,” Boa” and “Cobra.” Megan marks the singer’s first indie release. She previously discussed the album in an interview with L’OFFICIEL, saying she thinks of the project as a “rebirth.” “This is music I would like if I wasn’t Megan Thee Stallion,” she said in the interview. “I don’t want to say I’m tapping into other genres. I’m just tapping into other sounds. But it’s still very much Megan Thee Stallion. It won’t feel like I went so left. It’ll feel true to me. You’ll almost be like, ‘I wouldn’t have thought she would’ve rapped over that, but this sounds great.’” Megan Thee Stallion’s last LP, Traumazine, arrived in 2022. Her Hot Girl Summer tour is ongoing through late July.",

                    "text": "Megan Thee Stallion’s anticipated MEGAN album is just one week away from hitting streaming services, and she teased the Hotties by serving up the appetizing tracklist for the LP. The H-Town rapper released the tracklist for the 18-song set on social media on Friday (June 21) and the project is loaded with versatile guests. Meg will team up with the Grammy-winning Victoria Monét for a moody collab on “Spin.” She connects the generations of Houston as old school meets new school with UGK appearing on the album. It’s unclear if “Paper Together” invites a Bun B solo appearance or features posthumous vocals from the late Pimp C, who Meg is a massive fan of. Other features include her Hot Girl Summer tourmate GloRilla, 41’s Kyle Richh and Yuki Chiba. One of the song titles recalls a 2010s Billboard Hot 100 hit. David Guetta’s “Where Them Girls At” arrived in 2011 alongside Nicki Minaj and Flo Rida, which reached a peak of No. 14 on the Hot 100. MEGAN is filled with previously-released serpentine-themed singles such as No. 1 hit “HISS,” “BOA” and album closer “COBRA.” The Houston Hottie looks at this album as a “rebirth” of sorts after closing the book on the Tory Lanez shooting, which saw him sentenced to 10 years behind bars last August. “This is music I would like if I wasn’t Megan Thee Stallion. I don’t want to say I’m tapping into other genres. I’m just tapping into other sounds. But it’s still very much Megan Thee Stallion. It won’t feel like I went so left. It’ll feel true to me,” she told L’OFFICIEL of the project. “You’ll almost be like, ‘I wouldn’t have thought she would’ve rapped over that, but this sounds great.’” The 29-year-old wraps up the North American leg of her Hot Girl Summer Tour this weekend with a pair of shows in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.

                    "title": "Convicted Rust Armorer Won&#39;t Be Forced to Testify at Alec Baldwin’s Upcoming Trial, Judge Rules",
                    "text": "Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the Rust armorer serving an 18-month sentence for involuntary manslaughter due to her role in the accidental on-set shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in New Mexico in 2021, will not be forced to testify at Alec Baldwin’s July trial, the judge in the case ruled on Friday, June 21. “It's pretty clear that she does not intend to cooperate,” said Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer after hearing arguments for and against compelling her to testify. In a May pre-trial interview, Gutierrez-Reed asserted her Fifth Amendment privilege and refused to answer prosecutors' questions about the Baldwin case. Because of that, prosecutors filed a motion asking the court to force her to testify and grant her use immunity, meaning that whatever she said in her testimony could not be used against her in her pending appeal. Lawyers for Baldwin as well as attorneys for Gutierrez-Reed objected to the prosecution’s motion to give her use immunity. \"Does Ms. Gutierrez, to your knowledge, have any intent to answer the questions if given immunity?\" Sommer asked Gutierrez-Reed's attorney, Jason Bowles, during the hearing. \"Your honor, she does not want to be cooperative in this case,\" he replied, adding, \"She does not want to answer the questions.\" Reacting to the ruling, Bowles tells PEOPLE he is not sure whether the prosecution will still call her as a witness, but if they do, \"Ms. Gutierrez-Reed will invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege as we have long said and as is her right.\" Morrissey floated the idea of still calling her as a witness, and if she refuses to answer questions, \"we will be asking additional jail time.\" But in her ruling, Sommer said she would not want to conduct a \"trial within a trial.\" Gutierrez-Reed, who accidentally put live ammunition into the prop gun Baldwin, 66, was holding when it discharged killing Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March. She is also headed to trial in August on a separate felony charge for bringing a firearm into a bar. Baldwin, also facing an 18-month sentence if convicted, has insisted he never pulled the trigger and did not know the gun mistakenly contained live ammunition. In their May motion asking the court to force Gutierrez-Reed to testify, prosecutors argued that if she wasn’t granted use immunity, Baldwin would then “likely attempt to have her previous statements admitted” at trial. Those previous statements include clips of Gutierrez-Reed’s prior police interviews. “In her interviews she's very clear saying she should have checked [the gun] better,” legal expert Emily D. Baker, a former deputy L.A. district attorney not involved in the case previously explained to PEOPLE. “Those types of statements where she's accepting responsibility” are beneficial to Baldwin. And even though Gutierrez-Reed also said unflattering things about Baldwin in her police interviews, including how he was allegedly “not paying attention in his weapons training,” according to Baker, Baldwin’s team likely wouldn’t show those clips. The prosecution would not be able to play those clips for the jury, either, because “ it's hearsay,” according to Baker. “The defense can't cross examine, and it's being used against the defendant, not by the defendant.” Baldwin's trial is set to begin July 10.",

My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides. We’re about kicking down the door of thought everywhere and saying, “You are bigger and more capable than you realize. And we can prove it.” If you’re looking for bran muffin journalism, you can subscribe to the Monitor for $15.

                    "text": "NEW YORK -- Being the first at anything is no small task. As the first Asian female to be elected to the state Senate, Iwen Chu takes it in stride. Before being inducted into the State Senate, she made it her mission to serve her community and uplift underrepresented voices. Now she represents the 17th district, which includes neighborhoods with a largely diverse Asian community like Sunset Park, Bensonhurst, Bath Beach, Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights and Kensington. Since being inducted in January 2023, her mission has not wavered. Growing up in Taiwan, Senator Chu fell in love with the culture of Brooklyn during her trips to the United States. When she immigrated here at 27 years old, she set her sights on Brooklyn and planted her roots there. She has always had a passion for social issues and obtained a master's degree in sociology from Brooklyn College. In 2012, she began working for Assemblymember Peter Abbate. In this role, she noticed that there was not much Asian representation on the school and community boards. As someone who had emigrated herself, she understood how the language barrier was an obstacle for families. \"I want to be a part of the solution; that's always been my vision. Someone needs to do it, and Im going to do it,\" says Chu. As the representative of the 17th district, Senator Chu wanted to make a way for unity and give the community a sense of pride in their culture. This year, she hosted her 2nd annual AANHPI celebration to recognize the vast cultures of Asia through performances and dances. The event put a spotlight on the youth in the community, giving young people the opportunity to showcase talents and skills they're proud of. The performances consisted of Xiangxi Miao drum dance (traditional Chinese drum dance), Lazgi (Uzbekistan folklore dance), Bharatanatyam (Indian lecture dance), taekwondo performances, and a Dunhuang dance (traditional Chinese dance). During the event, community sponsors and the late John Liu were honored for their contributions to the Asian community. Celebrations like these are Senator Chu's hope for decreasing stereotypes and discrimination against the Asian community, giving the youth pride in their heritage, and finding unification through differences. \"I would like to bring this crowd to everyone. They should see the Asian culture being celebrated. They should see their language being served by the state government. They should see their dance, culture, and history on stage, in the textbook curriculum, and when there's a holiday, they should be able to celebrate with everybody,\" says Chu.",

The office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg dropped cases against 30 students and staff members who were arrested during the campus unrest. \"All these matters are dismissed and sealed in the interest of justice,\" Judge Kevin McGrath announced in the courtroom. JEWISH COLUMBIA STUDENT GROUP CLAIMS ‘ANTISEMITISM IS SHAPESHIFTING’ IN OPEN LETTER All the protesters were arrested on April 30, hours after taking over Hamilton Hall, an academic building, and were initially charged with trespass in the third degree, a misdemeanor. Stephen Millan, a prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney's office, said there was insufficient evidence to show that any individual defendant damaged property or injured anyone. He noted the protesters wore masks and covered surveillance cameras, Reuters reported. None of the students arrested had any prior criminal history, and all were facing disciplinary proceedings, including suspensions and expulsions, by Columbia University, prosecutors said. \"The Office is continuing to pursue cases from both campuses, including all assaults against police officers,\" the DA's office said in a statement to Fox News Digital, referring to Columbia and the City University of New York. \"There are ongoing school disciplinary proceedings for the students who had their case dismissed.\" Columbia University declined to comment on the dropped cases when reached by Fox News Digital. PARENTS WARN OF 'NIGHTMARE' CLIMATE ON COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS: JEWISH STUDENTS 'ARE BEING THREATENED' The chaotic protests came amid similar demonstrations in which anti-Israel protesters set up illegal encampments on college campuses throughout the country over Israel's war with Hamas. The protests intensified after Columbia issued mass suspensions. Bragg's office declined to drop the charges against another 13 defendants. Two of the 13 were Columbia students, and the other 11 had no affiliation with the school, although most were alumni. COLUMBIA FACILITIES WORKER WHO WENT VIRAL FOR SHOVING ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTER SAYS UNIVERSITY 'FAILED': REPORT Their cases would have been dropped if they avoided being arrested over the next six months. However, they rejected the offer and are scheduled to appear in court on July 25. The office is bringing charges against James Carlson, who is not affiliated with Columbia, of criminal mischief and arson for setting an Israeli flag alight prior to the takeover and for damaging a police surveillance camera in jail.

Thirty-one of the 46 people charged with trespassing tied to the protest had their charges dismissed Thursday by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, due to a general lack of evidence, NBC News reported. The district attorney's office also said it offered to dismiss the charges laid against 14 other defendants if they avoided arrest over the next six months -- an offer they rejected. Prosecutors said none of the arrested students had a prior criminal history, Fox News reported, adding that those affiliated with Columbia were still facing disciplinary proceedings, which could result in expulsion. The Manhattan District Attorney's Office said it is still proceeding with charges laid against a protester identified as James Carlson with has no affiliation to the university. He was charged in two separate cases, including one involving the burning of a flag. The protesters had occupied Columbia University's Hamilton Hall and were arrested late April after hundreds of New York Police Department officers gained access to the facility. The demonstration came as protesters at universities nationwide were calling on their institutions to divest from Israel and companies linked to Israel's military amid the Middle Eastern country's war against Hamas in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza.

                    "text": "NEW YORK—Dozens of pro-Palestinian student protesters arrested in April after occupying and barricading a building at Columbia University in New York City had all criminal charges against them dropped on Thursday, Manhattan prosecutors said at a court hearing. The hearing at the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse came seven weeks after Columbia administrators called in hundreds of armed and heavily armored police officers to the university’s campus in a high-profile law-enforcement response that was broadcast live on national news channels. Police arrested 46 protesters who had barricaded themselves inside Hamilton Hall, and cleared a weeks-old tent encampment on a nearby Columbia lawn that has inspired similar pro-Palestinian protests at universities around the world. At least nine of the 46 protesters arrested sustained injuries beyond minor scrapes and bruises, according to medical records, photographs shared by protesters, and interviews. All 46 protesters, who were arrested on the night of April 30 about 20 hours after taking over the academic building, were initially charged with trespass in the third degree, a misdemeanor. Stephen Millan, a prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney’s office, told the court on Thursday his office would not prosecute 30 protesters who were Columbia students at the time of the arrest, nor two who were Columbia employees, citing prosecutorial discretion and lack of evidence. A case against another student was dismissed earlier in the month. Mr. Millan said protesters wore masks and covered surveillance cameras, and there was insufficient evidence to show that any individual defendant damaged property or injured anyone. No police officers were injured during the arrests, the prosecutor noted. None of the arrested students had any prior criminal history, and all were facing disciplinary proceedings, including suspensions and expulsions, by Columbia. “All these matters are dismissed and sealed in the interest of justice,” Judge Kevin McGrath announced in the courtroom where dozens of defendants and their supporters appeared with keffiyeh scarves around their shoulders. The scarves have become a symbol of the pro-Palestinian movement. Prosecutors declined to outright drop trespass charges against 13 other people arrested inside Hamilton Hall that night. Two of the 13 were also Columbia students, while the other 11 had no current affiliation with the school, although most were alumni. The district attorney’s office proposed the 13 accept an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal, a provision in New York law that if accepted means the case against a defendant will be dropped and sealed in six months if they are not arrested for another offense in the interim. All 13 rejected the offer through their lawyers, who are seeking to have those cases dismissed. The 13 are due to return to court on July 25, by which date prosecutors must decide if they are willing to proceed to a trial over the trespass charges. Another arrested protester accepted the offer earlier in June. Prosecutors said they were seeking to prosecute only one of the 46 protesters arrested that night. James Carlson, who is not affiliated with Columbia, is charged with criminal mischief and arson for setting an Israeli flag alight prior to the takeover and for damaging a police surveillance camera in jail. Mr. Carlson, who appeared in court with his attorney, didn’t comment on the charges other than his lawyer saying they planned to challenge the prosecution. A Columbia spokesperson declined to comment on Thursday’s developments in court.",

                    "title": "&#8216;Trigger Warning&#8217; Review: Jessica Alba Has the Moves but Netflix Action Thriller Is Strictly Routine",
                    "text": "Jessica Alba’s new starring vehicle boasts plenty of action movie credentials. The star, making her first feature film appearance in five years after guiding her business venture The Honest Company to a billion dollar-plus valuation, has previously displayed her skills in such film and television projects as Dark Angel and the Fantastic Four and Sin City franchises. Production company Thunder Road boasts the John Wick and Sicario movies among its credits. And its trio of screenwriters are responsible for such efforts as Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, A History of Violence and HBO’s Westworld. More impressively, the film features many women among its creative team, including Indonesian director Mouly Surya (Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts), making her English-language debut, and director of photography Zoe White (The Handmaid’s Tale). Unfortunately, despite everyone’s best efforts to deliver a femme-driven actioner revolving around a central character who comes across like a female Rambo, Trigger Warning, premiering on Netflix, proves distressingly familiar. The badass bona fides of Alba’s character Parker, a Special Forces commando, are immediately established in the opening scene in which she’s seen effortlessly dispatching several terrorist types in the desert. She’s also shown to be honorable, demonstrated by her angry reaction when one of her fellow soldiers takes it upon himself to start executing the prisoners and she violently puts him in his place. Not long after, she’s informed that her father has been killed in a mine cave-in, prompting her return to her desert hometown with the symbolically less-than-subtle name of Creation. Not surprisingly, trouble follows her there, as she’s barely back in town a day when she single-handedly foils a robbery by subduing three bad guys, one of whom is brandishing an automatic weapon. She’s clearly an expert fighter not only with guns, but also in hand-to-hand combat, with knives, and, as later prominently showcased, machetes. If this weren’t an action film, Parker would be allowed to grieve for her father, accept her friends’ condolences and presumably return to active duty. No such luck. She comes to suspect that the death was no accident, suicide, or, as her former boyfriend-turned sheriff Jesse (Mark Webber, Green Room) suggests, a result of encroaching dementia. Her suspicions turn out to be correct, as she uncovers a criminal scheme to use the mine to steal weapons from a nearby military depot. Prominently figuring in the scheme is Jesse’s father (former teen star Anthony Michael Hall, who’s aged into his villainous looks), a corrupt senator — of a conservative bent, natch — and Jesse’s volatile brother Elvis (Jake Weary). For support, Parker enlists the help of her covert ops colleague Spider (stand-up comedian/actor Tone Bell), an expert computer hacker, and Mike (Gabriel Basso), a local drug dealer who’s like a younger brother to her. The by-the-numbers storyline unfolds exactly as you’d expect, despite the trio of screenwriters’ attempts to lend some quirkiness to the proceedings with such moments as the senator telling Parker that his great-grandfather was Native American. “It’s where I get my lactose intolerance from,” he snidely points out. Mostly, it’s an excuse for Alba to display her impressive physical fitness in a series of intense fight scenes, expertly choreographed in the sort of manner that allows you to see bodies in motion rather than mere flying limbs in frenzied jump cuts. Director Surya reveals an assured command of the form, delivering enough satisfying bone-crushing and knife-wielding sequences to satisfy undemanding, action-craving viewers looking for mindless distraction on a weekend night. Needless to say, by the time Parker asks one of her female friends, “You wouldn’t by any chance have a bunch of guns lying around somewhere, would you?” all hell breaks loose. Unfortunately, Alba, although more than competent, doesn’t quite have the full-bore charisma to make her character particularly interesting, or, as Netflix presumably hopes, the catalyst for a new action franchise. By the time the generically titled Trigger Warning reaches its predictable conclusion, you’ll be hankering to see what the streamer’s all-knowing algorithms have in store for you next.",

                    "text": "Along with sexy, sweaty Regency-era romance shows and middling science-fiction movies, military and military-adjacent action movies are one of Netflix’s main exports. It’s an easy sell: There will always be a market for stories of righteous soldiers using their tactical training and badass fighting skills to save their country, or save their family, or save their fellow soldiers, or some combination of the three. Trigger Warning, Netflix’s newest thriller starring Jessica Alba, isn’t amazing, but it’s one of the streaming service’s better offerings. The film opens with Parker (Alba), a skilled Special Forces operative, evading a bunch of terrorists in the middle of the Syrian desert. When her team comes to extract her, she stops one of them from executing their captives in anger—she’s a fighter, but she’s not bloodthirsty. Shortly afterward, a former flame calls to inform her that her father has died due to a cave-in in the mine he was digging on their New Mexico land, so she heads home, taking up residence in her father’s house and working at the local bar he used to own. But something about her father’s death doesn’t sit right with Parker, and with a gang of black-market arms dealers prowling around the town she soon comes to realize that there’s more to all of this than meets the eye—and her father’s death may not have been an accident after all. Luckily for her, this sort of detective work involves her main skill set: finding creative ways to beat up bad guys. Trigger Warning is the English-language debut of acclaimed Indonesian director Mouly Surya, best known for thrillers like her 2008 debut Fiksi and 2017’s Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts, the latter of which inspired the term “satay Western” given its Western-inspired narrative and rural setting. Trigger Warning is something of a modern American Western: a soldier returns from war to find her community worse than she left it, determined to avenge the suspicious death of a family member. In this version, Alba slings her fists instead of guns, preferring to fight with hands and knives and, in one particularly creative scene, various construction tools found in a hardware store. The script is partially credited to writer Halley Gross, who won multiple awards for her work on the survival-adventure video game The Last of Us Part II, and Trigger Warning is indeed very video game-y. The fight scenes are separated by conversations that play like game characters meandering through dialogue trees, each talk containing one or two pieces of information that Parker uses to build her picture of what’s really going on. The fight scenes—every scene without dialogue, essentially—are great as well as numerous, Surya and her crew take plenty of cues from the John Wick-ification trends currently dominating the action genre. You’d think it would get old, but fights that are “like John Wick” are basically good, so I can’t really complain. Apart from Alba’s Parker, the rest of the movie is populated by the requisite gun-toting goons, three-to-five interchangeable guys with brownish blondish hair and beards who are either allies or adversaries, one guy with a secret cannabis farm and a pet iguana, and a chatty hacker named, of course, Spider. Anthony Michael Hall appears in a few scenes as a vaguely villainous shadow figure, a senator running for reelection who vows to fight for the “freedom, family, and faith” of his constituents, whose political leanings are probably obvious. The movie keeps things self-consciously current with a few references to “Karens” and a bit about the term “Latinx,” though with a title like “Trigger Warning” you’d expect the characters to trade more barbs about soy-faced libs and alt-right fascists. There are a few nods to Parker’s—and, by extension, Alba’s—Mexican heritage: Her flashbacks to her father and herself as a young girl are entirely in Spanish, and a short scene depicting her father’s funeral is shot like something out of a telenovela, Alba weeping beautifully over strains of Ángela Aguilar’s lament “La llorona.” If anything, Trigger Warning is a movie for those of us who have missed seeing Alba in action-star mode—in the past few years she seems to have made a point of gravitating towards roles where her characters punch first and ask questions later. Given how terrible other Netflix action movies starring A-list actresses have been lately (looking at you, Atlas, and you, Heart of Stone, and you, Damsel), it feels almost revolutionary to watch one that’s actually engaging. Plus, there’s an iguana in this one.",

                    "text": "We’ve not seen that much of Jessica Alba on screen of late, the once-hard-to-avoid star (between the years of 2007 and 2010, she was in 13 films) mostly stepping back from movies (between 2018 and 2024, she was in just two). She took time to focus on motherhood with three kids to care for as well as expanding her don’t-call-it-Goop eco-friendly brand The Honest Company, which at its peak was worth $1bn, a persuasive enough reason to put a pause on Hollywood for a while. But after stepping down from her role as COO, she decided to launch her own production company, now taking on her first bona fide lead since 2016’s little-seen horror The Veil. It’s a smart choice of both genre and platform, a Netflix action movie that should be an easy win, her brand of 2000s fame making her a perfect fit for the same viewers who rush toward the streamer’s latest Adam Sandler and Jennifer Lopez offerings. It’s likely that Trigger Warning, launching on a rather dead weekend for new films at the cinema, will hit a sweet spot, tapping into Netflix’s undemanding action audience who have happily made hits from a string of duds. Positioned as a franchise-starter, compared a little ambitiously to both Rambo and John Wick when announced back in 2016, it gives Alba the opportunity to go from zero to 100 in terms of screentime, cropping up in almost every scene, an opportunity she would be less likely to receive in a wide theatrical release at this stage. She plays Parker, a special forces commando called back to her small home town when her father dies, an apparent accident that may have been a suicide that she’s convinced was murder. There are some shady types circling her, from Anthony Michael Hall’s ultra-conservative, anti-woke senator to his trigger-happy son to some local criminals engaging in behaviour she’s incapable of ignoring. We’re in basic 80s action movie territory, quite obviously hinted at in one scene when a character watches and comments on a Chuck Norris movie, a barebones formula regurgitation that somehow needed three writers to stitch it together (John Brancato, Josh Olson and Halley Gross). In among their combined credits, films like A History of Violence and David Fincher’s The Game along with episodes of Westworld show that there’s a glimmer of something at work, and while Trigger Warning could have benefited from a script with a little bit more on its mind, it’s smooth and serviceable and at times even vaguely politically interesting. The Reagan-era shoot-em-ups it’s modelled on were not known for their progressivism, pushing a rough red meat conservative agenda and while Trigger Warning is still very pro-military, it’s also violently against the racism and regression of Republican politics. Hall’s rightwing politician is a villain not just for his actions but for his beliefs, topped only by the film’s ultimate Big Bad: white male domestic terrorists. It’s not quite enough to push the film into genuinely smart or noteworthy territory but it adds some punchy election year anger to Alba’s inevitable and involving revenge mission and tracks that it was made by a non-American – the English-language debut from the Indonesian director Mouly Surya. Alba hasn’t always made the strongest impression as an actor but this mode works well for her, convincing both in her many hand-to-hand combat scenes (her weapon of choice is a knife rather than a gun) and as an old-fashioned movie star, light on emotional depth but heavy on charisma. It’s a pretty straightforward reintroduction but an effective one and while nothing here is distinctive enough to demand more from the character, there are many more worse sequel prospects, especially within Netflix’s franchise farm. Like the streamer’s many no-attention-required romcoms, it’s a copy of a copy of a copy built to disappear from one’s memory as soon as the credits begin. It’ll do for Friday night, just don’t expect to remember it come Sunday. Trigger Warning is now available on Netflix",

                    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — On a night for doubling up at the U.S. Olympic swimming trials, Lilly King left with another big prize. An engagement ring. Ryan Murphy, Regan Smith, Kate Douglass and King all claimed a second individual event at the Paris Games with their performances Thursday in the temporary pool at Lucas Oil Stadium. But the most dramatic moment came just off the deck. King’s boyfriend, former Indiana University swimmer James Wells, pulled out a ring, dropped to a knee and asked her to marry him. She said yes with a kiss and a big hug. “I didn’t see it” Murphy said. “That’s unbelievable. I’d love to hear her reaction to how it is to get proposed to completely out of breath and soaked. That’s incredible. She must be riding an absolute high.” Murphy touched first in the men’s 200-meter backstroke, adding to his triumph in the 100 back. Smith won the women’s 200 butterfly after previously setting a world record in the 100 backstroke. And Douglass followed up her win a night earlier in the 100 freestyle with a victory in the 200 breaststroke. King rallied to finish behind Douglass, edging Alex Walsh for the second U.S. spot at the Olympics. King had previously won the 100 breaststroke. Murphy used his stunning underwater technique to hold off Keaton Jones and Jack Akins, finishing in 1 minute, 54.33 seconds. He punched the water in triumph when he saw his name atop the scoreboard for the second time in the meet. “The last 25, you’re just battling,” Murphy said. “Nothing feels good the last 25. It’s like, all right, how can hold this stroke together against the wall, get this done and finish the job?” Jones claimed the second spot at the Olympics in 1:54.61, while it was another heartbreaking finish for Akins. He was third in 1:54.78, the same position he had in the 100 backstroke when he missed a Paris berth by two-hundredths of a second. Smith trailed 17-year-old Alex Shackell at the final turn but rallied to win in 2:05.70. Shackell, from suburban Carmel, thrilled the home crowd by claiming an Olympic berth in 2:06.69 Shackell is heading to the Olympics with her 19-year-old brother Aaron, who made the team by winning the 400 freestyle on the opening night of the trials. Their father, Nick Shackell, represented Britain at the 1996 and 2000 Olympics. Douglass dominated the 200 breaststroke, going out under world-record pace over the first half of the race and finishing in 2:19.46. “I’m really happy with both of those wins I’ve had so far,” Douglass said. “That was my goal coming into the meet. I was confident in myself, and I’m really happy I was able to pull it off.” King was third at the final turn, but turned up the pace on the final lap for a runner-up finish of 2:21.93. Walsh, a silver medalist in the 200 individual medley at Tokyo Olympics, failed to join her sister Gretchen on this Olympic team. Alex Walsh still has a shot to make the squad in the 200 IM, which begins Friday. Caeleb Dressel bounced back with the second-fastest time in the semifinals of the 50 freestyle, one night after a third-place finish in the 100 free cost him a chance to defend his Olympic title in that event. Dressel will need to finish in the top two of the 50 free final Friday night to claim his first individual race of the Paris Games. The tattooed Floridian was one of the biggest stars in Tokyo, winning five gold medals, but he hasn’t been as dominant since returning from a long layoff. There was another bit of drama at the end of the night. After tying for eighth place in the 50 free semifinals, Adam Chaney and Jonny Kulow had a swim-off for the final spot in the final. But they tied for a second time at 21.79, forcing another swim-off after many fans had headed for the exits. Finally, the matter was settled when Chaney touched in 21.81 to eliminate Kulow, who finished at 21.99. Chaney emphatically splashed the water before reaching over the rope to console Kulow. ___ AP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games",

                    "title": "Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky denies it's a hazard after the U.S. bans its software",
                    "text": "The cybersecurity firm Kaspersky denied Friday that it is a security threat after the U.S. Commerce Department banned the use of its software in the United States. The Moscow-based company — whose CEO Eugene Kaspersky is Russian — said in a statement that the Commerce Department’s decision would not affect its ability to sell and promote its cyber security products and training in the U.S. Kaspersky said the government had based its decision on the “geopolitical climate and theoretical concerns” rather than independently verifying if there was a risk. The government says Kaspersky’s Russian connections mean the company poses an “undue or unacceptable risk to U.S. national security or the safety and security.” The company conducts much of its business in Russia and, as a Russian citizen who lives in that country, Eugene Kaspersky himself is subject to Russian law, the Commerce Department said in a decision dated June 14 that was posted on the Federal Register. The department said it had considered Kaspersky's objections to the initial findings of its investigation into whether its products or services posed a threat and found that the decision to ban its software was “well supported.” Aside from the company's obligation to abide by Russian laws and decisions, its software can be exploited to identify sensitive U.S. citizens' data and make it available to Russian government actors, the department said. “The risks to U.S. national security addressed in this Final Determination stem not from whether Kaspersky’s products are effective at identifying viruses and other malware, but whether they can be used strategically to cause harm to the United States,” it said.

                    "text": "Sandra Bernhard has apologized for being “dismissive” of fellow actress Morgan Fairchild, who played her love interest in three episodes of Roseanne Season 5. Bernhard revealed on Thursday night’s (June 20) episode of Watch What Happens Live that “one of her biggest regrets” in life was that she “wasn’t nicer” to Fairchild, leaving host Andy Cohen in utter shock. “To this day, I would like to say to Morgan: you were incredible to work with. You went there,” she said. “We were the first gay couple on TV. Unlike everybody thinks everybody else was — we were. And you are fabulous and you are on the right side politically. I owe you an apology. I adore you. And thank you for putting up with my snotty little attitude.” Cohen couldn’t believe what he was hearing — so he continued to grill Bernhard, asking her if she ever reached out to Fairchild after working together. “I didn’t really know how. I think this is the time and the best way to do it,” she said. “She will watch [this] and she’ll hear it and she deserves it. She’s a great lady. She was game!” According to Bernhard, she wasn’t the only one who gave Fairchild a hard time on set. “Everybody was kind of not nice to her,” she confessed. “I’m calling myself out, honey — along with everybody else.” Cohen then wondered if series star Roseanne Barr was also mean to Fairchild, to which Bernhard replied, “Eh, you know. She was just in her own world.” The comedian held a recurring role as Nancy Bartlett Thomas in Roseanne, while Fairchild played her bisexual girlfriend in the sitcom’s fifth season. While chatting with Cohen, Bernhard recalled a scene in which their characters leaned in for a kiss — but the “censors” cut them off just as they got close to sealing the deal. “That’s how long ago this was,” she said. Watch What Happens Live airs Sunday through Thursdays at 10 p.m. ET on Bravo. New episodes are available to stream the next day on Peacock.",

                    "text": "Sandra Bernhard is revealing that one of her \"biggest regrets\" to this day is the way she treated Morgan Fairchild on the set of Roseanne. The actress and singer of stage and screen spoke about it with Andy Cohen on Thursday's episode of Watch What Happens Live. \"I was a little, you know, dismissive of Morgan,\" Bernhard, 69, said on the on Bravo talk show. Turning to face the camera directly, she continued, \"I would like to say to Morgan, you are incredible to work with, you went there. We were the first gay couple on TV — unlike everybody thinks everybody else was, we were! — and you're fabulous, and you are on the right side politically. I owe you an apology, I adore you, and thank you for putting up with my snotty little attitude.\" Bernhard played the recurring role of Nancy Bartlett, the estranged wife of Tom Arnold's Arnie Thomas, on the long-running ABC sitcom. Fairchild, 74, came on the show for three episodes of season 5 in 1992 to play Bartlett's girlfriend Marla, though the relationship didn't last. When asked if Bernhard had reached out to Fairchild, the actress said she \"didn't really know how\" but hoped her former colleague would see her apology on Watch What Happens Live. \"Everybody was kind of not nice to her,\" Bernhard added. \"I'm calling myself out, honey, along with everybody else.\" Asked if lead star Roseanne Barr was ever mean to Fairchild, Bernhard said, \"Eh, you know, she was in her own world.\" Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more. Fairchild spoke about her experience playing Marla on the Behind the Velvet Rope podcast just last year, saying her agent was \"on the fence\" about whether she should take the part. \"Because a lipstick lesbian had never been done [on TV],\" she recalled. \"I am just this weird person that I like doing iconoclastic things. I don't like doing the safe thing. I like doing things that are gonna shock people or make them think about something or make them look at you a different way. So I said yes.\" Ultimately, Fairchild thought the role was both funny and eye-opening. \"I thought it was a chance to create a discussion in society, because it was a very hot show and I knew it would be water-cooler talk,\" she said.",

The Will and Grace alum, 69, appeared on Watch What Happens Live earlier this week and admitted to host Andy Cohen that she sees her behavior on the set of Roseanne differently now. When asked about what it was like working with Morgan Fairchild, Bernhard had a surprising answer. “It is one of my biggest regrets that I wasn’t nicer to her,” she said. “I was a little dismissive of Morgan, and I, to this day, would like to say to Morgan, ‘You were incredible to work with.’” The actress went on to explain that she doesn’t know why she wasn’t nice to Fairchild — who played Bernard's on-screen girlfriend Marla on the hit series in 1992 — but it was the “right time” to make her amends since she thought the Search for Tomorrow actress might be watching. “You’re fabulous and you’re on the right side politically,” Bernhard said. “I owe you an apology. I adore you, and thanks for putting up with my snotty little attitude.” She later added: “She will watch it and she will hear it and she deserves it. She's a great lady.

The actress and comedian also gave Fairchild props for taking on such a pivotal role in television. “You went there — we were the first gay couple on TV unlike everybody thinks everybody else was, we were,” Bernhard said.",

                    "title": "How does heat kill? It confuses your brain. It shuts down your organs. It overworks your heart.",
                    "text": "As temperatures and humidity soar outside, what’s happening inside the human body can become a life-or-death battle decided by just a few degrees. The critical danger point outdoors for illness and death from relentless heat is several degrees lower than experts once thought, say researchers who put people in hot boxes to see what happens to them. With much of the United States, Mexico, India and the Middle East suffering through blistering heat waves, worsened by human-caused climate change, several doctors, physiologists and other experts explained to The Associated Press what happens to the human body in such heat. Key body temperature The body’s resting core temperature is typically about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). That’s only 7 degrees (4 Celsius) away from catastrophe in the form of heatstroke, said Ollie Jay, a professor of heat and health at the University of Sydney in Australia, where he runs the thermoergonomics laboratory. Dr. Neil Gandhi, emergency medicine director at Houston Methodist Hospital, said during heat waves anyone who comes in with a fever of 102 or higher and no clear source of infection will be looked at for heat exhaustion or the more severe heatstroke. “We routinely will see core temperatures greater than 104, 105 degrees during some of the heat episodes,” Gandhi said. Another degree or three and such a patient is at high risk of death, he said. How heat kills Heat kills in three main ways, Jay said. The usual first suspect is heatstroke — critical increases in body temperature that cause organs to fail. When inner body temperature gets too hot, the body redirects blood flow toward the skin to cool down, Jay said. But that diverts blood and oxygen away from the stomach and intestines, and can allow toxins normally confined to the gut area to leak into circulation. “That sets off a cascade of effects,” Jay said. “Clotting around the body and multiple organ failure and, ultimately, death.” But the bigger killer in heat is the strain on the heart, especially for people who have cardiovascular disease, Jay said. It again starts with blood rushing to the skin to help shed core heat. That causes blood pressure to drop. The heart responds by trying to pump more blood to keep you from passing out. “You’re asking the heart to do a lot more work than it usually has to do,” Jay said. For someone with a heart condition “it’s like running for a bus with dodgy (hamstring). Something’s going to give.” The third main way is dangerous dehydration. As people sweat, they lose liquids to a point that can severely stress kidneys, Jay said. Many people may not realize their danger, Houston’s Gandhi said. Dehydration can progress into shock, causing organs to shut down from lack of blood, oxygen and nutrients, leading to seizures and death, said Dr. Renee Salas, a Harvard University professor of public health and an emergency room physician at Massachusetts General Hospital. “Dehydration can be very dangerous and even deadly for everyone if it gets bad enough — but it is especially dangerous for those with medical conditions and on certain medications,” Salas said. Dehydration also reduces blood flow and magnifies cardiac problems, Jay said. Attacking the brain Heat also affects the brain. It can cause a person to have confusion, or trouble thinking, several doctors said. “One of the first symptoms you’re getting into trouble with the heat is if you get confused,” said University of Washington public health and climate professor Kris Ebi. That’s little help as a symptom because the person suffering from the heat is unlikely to recognize it, she said. And it becomes a bigger problem as people age. One of the classic definitions of heat stroke is a core body temperature of 104 degrees “coupled with cognitive dysfunction,” said Pennsylvania State University physiology professor W. Larry Kenney. Humidity matters Some scientists use a complicated outside temperature measurement called wet bulb globe temperature, which takes into account humidity, solar radiation and wind. In the past, it was thought that a wet-bulb reading of 95 Fahrenheit (35 Celsius) was the point when the body started having trouble, said Kenney, who also runs a hot box lab and has done nearly 600 tests with volunteers. His tests show the wet-bulb danger point is closer to 87 (30.5 Celsius). That’s a figure that has started to appear in the Middle East, he said. And that’s just for young healthy people. For older people, the danger point is a wet bulb temperature of 82 (28 degrees Celsius), he said. “Humid heat waves kill a lot more people than dry heat waves,” Kenney said. When Kenney tested young and old people in dry heat, young volunteers could function until 125.6 degrees (52 degrees Celsius), while the elderly had to stop at 109.4 (43 degrees Celsius). With high or moderate temperatures, the people could not function at nearly as high a temperature, he said. “Humidity impacts the ability of sweat to evaporate,” Jay said. Rushing to make patients cool Heatstroke is an emergency, and medical workers try to cool a victim down within 30 minutes, Salas said. The best way: Cold water immersion.

                    "text": "The critical danger point outdoors for illness and death from relentless heat is several degrees lower than experts once thought, say researchers who put people in hot boxes to see what happens to them. With much of the United States, Mexico, India and the Middle East suffering through blistering heat waves, worsened by human-caused climate change, several doctors, physiologists and other experts explained to The Associated Press what happens to the human body in such heat. Key body temperature The body’s resting core temperature is typically about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). That’s only 7 degrees (4 Celsius) away from catastrophe in the form of heatstroke, said Ollie Jay, a professor of heat and health at the University of Sydney in Australia, where he runs the thermoergonomics laboratory. Dr. Neil Gandhi, emergency medicine director at Houston Methodist Hospital, said during heat waves anyone who comes in with a fever of 102 or higher and no clear source of infection will be looked at for heat exhaustion or the more severe heatstroke. “We routinely will see core temperatures greater than 104, 105 degrees during some of the heat episodes,” Gandhi said. Another degree or three and such a patient is at high risk of death, he said. How heat kills Heat kills in three main ways, Jay said. The usual first suspect is heatstroke — critical increases in body temperature that cause organs to fail. When inner body temperature gets too hot, the body redirects blood flow toward the skin to cool down, Jay said. But that diverts blood and oxygen away from the stomach and intestines, and can allow toxins normally confined to the gut area to leak into circulation. “That sets off a cascade of effects,” Jay said. “Clotting around the body and multiple organ failure and, ultimately, death.” But the bigger killer in heat is the strain on the heart, especially for people who have cardiovascular disease, Jay said. It again starts with blood rushing to the skin to help shed core heat. That causes blood pressure to drop. The heart responds by trying to pump more blood to keep you from passing out. “You’re asking the heart to do a lot more work than it usually has to do,” Jay said. For someone with a heart condition “it’s like running for a bus with dodgy (hamstring). Something’s going to give.” The third main way is dangerous dehydration. As people sweat, they lose liquids to a point that can severely stress kidneys, Jay said. Many people may not realize their danger, Houston’s Gandhi said. Dehydration can progress into shock, causing organs to shut down from lack of blood, oxygen and nutrients, leading to seizures and death, said Dr. Renee Salas, a Harvard University professor of public health and an emergency room physician at Massachusetts General Hospital. “Dehydration can be very dangerous and even deadly for everyone if it gets bad enough — but it is especially dangerous for those with medical conditions and on certain medications,” Salas said. Dehydration also reduces blood flow and magnifies cardiac problems, Jay said. Attacking the brain Heat also affects the brain. It can cause a person to have confusion, or trouble thinking, several doctors said. “One of the first symptoms you’re getting into trouble with the heat is if you get confused,” said University of Washington public health and climate professor Kris Ebi. That’s little help as a symptom because the person suffering from the heat is unlikely to recognize it, she said. And it becomes a bigger problem as people age. One of the classic definitions of heat stroke is a core body temperature of 104 degrees “coupled with cognitive dysfunction,” said Pennsylvania State University physiology professor W. Larry Kenney. Humidity matters Some scientists use a complicated outside temperature measurement called wet bulb globe temperature, which takes into account humidity, solar radiation and wind. In the past, it was thought that a wet-bulb reading of 95 Fahrenheit (35 Celsius) was the point when the body started having trouble, said Kenney, who also runs a hot box lab and has done nearly 600 tests with volunteers. His tests show the wet-bulb danger point is closer to 87 (30.5 Celsius). That’s a figure that has started to appear in the Middle East, he said. And that’s just for young healthy people. For older people, the danger point is a wet bulb temperature of 82 (28 degrees Celsius), he said. “Humid heat waves kill a lot more people than dry heat waves,” Kenney said. When Kenney tested young and old people in dry heat, young volunteers could function until 125.6 degrees (52 degrees Celsius), while the elderly had to stop at 109.4 (43 degrees Celsius). With high or moderate humidity, the people could not function at nearly as high a temperature, he said. “Humidity impacts the ability of sweat to evaporate,” Jay said. Rushing to make patients cool Heatstroke is an emergency, and medical workers try to cool a victim down within 30 minutes, Salas said. The best way: Cold water immersion. Basically, “you drop them in a water bucket,” Salas said. But those aren’t always around. So emergency rooms pump patients with cool fluids intravenously, spray them with misters, put ice packs in armpits and groins and place them on a chilling mat with cold water running inside it. Sometimes it doesn’t work. “We call it the silent killer because it’s not this kind of visually dramatic event,” Jay said. “It’s insidious. It’s hidden.”",

                    "text": "TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas’ governor signed legislation Friday enabling the state to lure the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs and Major League Baseball’s Royals away from neighboring Missouri by helping the teams pay for new stadiums. Gov. Laura Kelly’s action came three days after the Republican-led Legislature approved the measure with bipartisan supermajorities — an unusually quick turnaround that signals how urgently Kansas officials consider making the offers. Missouri officials have argued that discussions about building new stadiums are still in the early stages. They said construction of a new one typically takes about three years, and pointed out that the lease on the existing complex that includes the teams’ side-by-side stadiums doesn’t end until January 2031. The measure Kelly signed takes effect July 1 and will allow bonds to cover 70% of a new stadium’s cost. The state would have 30 years to pay them off with revenues from sports betting, state lottery ticket sales, and new sales and alcohol taxes generated in the area around each proposed stadium. The Kansas-Missouri border splits the 2.3 million-resident Kansas City area, with about 60% of the people living on the Missouri side. Kansas officials began working on the legislation after voters on the Missouri side of the metropolitan area refused in April to continue a sales tax used to keep up the existing stadium complex. The Royals outlined a plan in February to build a $2 billion-plus ballpark in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, while the Chiefs were planning an $800 million renovation of their existing home. Attorneys for the teams told Kansas legislators they needed to make decisions about the future soon for new stadiums to be ready on time — though the Royals had planned to move into a new downtown ballpark at the start of their 2028 season. Some critics suggested the teams are pitting the two states against each other for the biggest government subsidies possible. “The Chiefs and the Royals are pretty much using us,” said state Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Democrat from the Kansas City, Kansas, area who voted against the bill. Supporters of bringing the teams to Kansas warned that if neither state acts quickly enough, one or both teams could leave for another community entirely. Several economists who have studied professional sports were skeptical that a move would make financial sense for either a team or a new host city, and both the National Football League and Major League Baseball require a supermajority of owners to approve franchise moves. The plan had support from throughout Kansas, including about half of the lawmakers from western Kansas, 200 miles (320 kilometers) away from any new stadium. Kansas lawmakers approved the stadium financing plan during a single-day special session Tuesday. Kelly, a Democrat, called the session for the Legislature to consider tax cuts after she vetoed three previous tax plans and legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. On Friday, she also signed a bill that will save income and property taxpayers a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Although the financing law doesn’t specifically name the Chiefs or Royals, it is limited to stadiums for National Football League and Major League Baseball teams “in any state adjacent to Kansas.” “It’s fairly clearly about how you poach,” Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas said during a news conference after Kansas lawmakers approved the measure. He added that his city would “lay out a good offer” to keep both teams in town and that the teams ”are in an exceptional leverage position.”",

The state would have 30 years to pay them off with revenues from sports betting, state lottery ticket sales, and new sales and alcohol taxes generated in the area around each proposed stadium. The Kansas-Missouri border splits the 2.3 million-resident Kansas City area, with about 60% of the people living on the Missouri side. Kansas officials began working on the legislation after voters on the Missouri side of the metropolitan area refused in April to continue a sales tax used to keep up the existing stadium complex. The Royals outlined a plan in February to build a $2 billion-plus ballpark in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, while the Chiefs were planning an $800 million renovation of their existing home. Attorneys for the teams told Kansas legislators they needed to make decisions about the future soon for new stadiums to be ready on time - though the Royals had planned to move into a new downtown ballpark at the start of their 2028 season. Some critics suggested the teams are pitting the two states against each other for the biggest government subsidies possible. “The Chiefs and the Royals are pretty much using us,” said state Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Democrat from the Kansas City, Kansas, area who voted against the bill. Supporters of bringing the teams to Kansas warned that if neither state acts quickly enough, one or both teams could leave for another community entirely. Several economists who have studied professional sports were skeptical that a move would make financial sense for either a team or a new host city, and both the National Football League and Major League Baseball require a supermajority of owners to approve franchise moves. The plan had support from throughout Kansas, including about half of the lawmakers from western Kansas, 200 miles (320 kilometers) away from any new stadium. Kansas lawmakers approved the stadium financing plan during a single-day special session Tuesday. Kelly, a Democrat, called the session for the Legislature to consider tax cuts after she vetoed three previous tax plans and legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. On Friday, she also signed a bill that will save income and property taxpayers a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Although the financing law doesn’t specifically name the Chiefs or Royals, it is limited to stadiums for National Football League and Major League Baseball teams “in any state adjacent to Kansas.” “It’s fairly clearly about how you poach,” Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas said during a news conference after Kansas lawmakers approved the measure. He added that his city would “lay out a good offer” to keep both teams in town and that the teams ”are in an exceptional leverage position.”",

A person of interest is in custody in connection to the fatal shooting of a 7-year-old in Chicago's Near West Side neighborhood, Chicago police spokesperson Tom Ahern confirmed. It is currently unknown if any charges are pending against the person of interest. Jai'Mani Amir Rivera was leaving his family's Near West Side residence Tuesday afternoon when he was struck by gunfire. Police do not believe he was targeted. At a press conference Tuesday afternoon, CPD Supt. Larry Snelling called gun violence in the city \"unbearable and unacceptable\" in the shooting's aftermath. Chicago Police Supt. Larry Snelling during a press conference Tuesday called gun violence in the city \"unbearable and unacceptable\" after a 7-year-old child was fatally struck by gunfire on Chicago's Near West Side in broad daylight. \"The random shooting of this 7-year-old is unacceptable,\" Snelling said. \"We really have to think about who we are as a society when our kids are being shot in the street.\" Just before 4 p.m. Tuesday, police responded to a call of shots fired and a person shot in the 2300 block of West Jackson Boulevard, Snelling said. Upon arrival, officers found that a child had sustained a gunshot wound to the chest and was laying on the ground. Officers performed life-saving measures on the child before he was transported in a police car to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead, police said. The Cook County Medical Examiner later identified the boy was identified as Jai'Mani Amir Rivera. According to officials, the child was leaving their residence and going to visit a neighbor who lived nearby when he was struck by gunfire. \"We are losing our children,\" Snelling said. \"And we really need to think about the gun violence that's going on in this city. And we all need to step up to try to fight this type of gun violence to save our children.\" Snelling added that the department was still investigating the incident, searching for video footage or other evidence of the suspect or suspects involved. \"When we arrest people for violent crimes, we have to prosecute them,\" Snelling said. \"We have to keep them off the street. We cannot allow repeat offenders to go back out on the street. ... These are great people living in these communities, and a lot of them are prisoners in their own homes. We want to do whatever we can to put an end to that.\" According to Snelling, 127 children and teens under the age of 18 have been victims of gun violence in 2024. 17 of those shot have been killed. \"Those numbers are significantly down from last year, but still unacceptable,\" Snelling said. Mayor Brandon Johnson also spoke at the press conference, saying he had reaching a \"breaking point\" regarding gun violence in the city. \"These acts of violence must end,\" Johnson said. \"The weapons that are flowing to the streets of Chicago and around this country. We have to stop and then we have to hold people accountable.\"",

                    "text": "A person of interest was taken into police custody Thursday in connection with the shooting death of a 7-year-old boy on the Near West Side this week. Jai’mani Amir Rivera was stepping outside his home around 3 p.m. Tuesday in the 2300 block of West Jackson Boulevard when shots were fired and he was struck in the chest, according to Chicago police and the Cook County medical examiner’s office. Responding officers rendered aid to the boy, then rushed him to Stroger Hospital in their squad car. Jai’mani was pronounced dead at the hospital shortly after arriving, officials said. Police said a person of interest related to the shooting was in custody, but no other information was released. Charges have not been filed. Chicago police Supt. Larry Snelling said Tuesday that officers were canvassing the area and were checking for any video evidence that could help to identify the shooter. Sources told the Sun-Times that an assault-style rifle may have been used in the attack. At least 11 rifle casings were found at the scene, an officer reported. It’s unclear if any weapon was recovered during Thursday’s arrest. At a vigil Wednesday near the shooting scene, more than 100 people gathered to remember Jai’mani and call for justice in the attack. Jai’mani’s aunt, Vanessa Rivera, remembered the boy as an “outgoing” kid who loved football. He had just received his jersey for the upcoming season. “He was more than a nephew to me,” Rivera said. “We lost my nephew, a 7-year-old kid. … All I ask for is justice.” The family has set up a GoFundMe to help cover costs, which had raised more than $18,000 of the $50,000 goal by Thursday evening. At least 172 juveniles have been shot in Chicago this year, according to Snelling. Jai’mani is the eighth child aged 15 or younger to have been fatally shot this year, according to Sun-Times homicide data.",

                    "text": "Chicago’s top cop announced Friday evening that a teenager has been charged in the daytime killing of a 7-year-old boy earlier this week on the Near West Side. The 16-year-old was charged with first-degree murder for the shooting of Jai’mani Amir Rivera around 3 p.m. Tuesday near his apartment complex in the 2300 block of West Jackson Boulevard, Police Supt. Larry Snelling told reporters. Jai’mani was leaving home when he was struck in the chest by gunfire that came from outside the complex, according to Chicago police and the Cook County medical examiner’s office. Responding officers rendered aid to the boy and rushed him to Stroger Hospital in a squad car, but he was pronounced dead a short time later. Law enforcement sources have said the boy may have been shot with a rifle, and Mayor Brandon Johnson indicated the weapon used in the attack was illegal. “We have had enough of this,” Johnson said at a news conference outside the hospital on Tuesday with Snelling. “We’re not pointing a finger at anybody,” Johnson added. “We all have to get to work and decide what kind of city we ultimately want to be: A city where children can get up and walk and ride their bikes and play, or a city that has allowed weapons to come into this city to terrorize us.” Snelling said officers were canvassing the area and checking for video evidence to help identify the gunman. At a vigil Wednesday near the shooting scene on Wednesday, more than 100 people gathered to remember Jai’mani and call for action. His aunt, Vanessa Rivera, described him as “outgoing” and said he had just gotten a jersey for the upcoming football season with the number he wanted: seven. “All I ask for is justice,” she said. A reward for information leading to the suspect’s identification totaled at least $16,000. By Thursday, police said a person of interest was in custody without providing further details. The fatal shooting came in the wake of a violent Father’s Day weekend that left 72 people wounded, including a 13-year-old boy who was killed in North Lawndale. Earlier this week, Snelling said 172 juveniles had been victims of gun violence this year. Jai’Mani is the eighth child age 15 or younger to have been shot to death this year, according to Sun-Times homicide data. “It’s unfortunate that a mother and a father, who are doing what they are supposed to do for their 7-year-old and raising their child, that their child can’t even walk out to the sidewalk without being struck by random gunfire,” Snelling said at the Tuesday news conference. A GoFundMe campaign set up by Jai’Mani’s family had raised more than $28,000 of a $50,000 goal by Friday evening.",

                    "text": "Less than 24 hours after Paramount Network announced the long-awaited premiere date for the second part of Yellowstone Season 5, Kevin Costner has bid farewell to the show for good. The actor, who famously played Dutton family patriarch John Dutton, confirmed his permanent exit from Taylor Sheridan‘s hit series in a social media video. “I just want to reach out and let you know that after this long year and a half of working on Horizon and doing all the things that’s required and thinking about Yellowstone, that beloved series that I love, that I know you love,” he says in the video. “I just realized that I’m not going to be able to continue, Season 5B or into the future.” Costner adds, “It was something that really changed me. I loved it and I know you loved it, and I just wanted to let you know that I won’t be returning. I love the relationship we’ve been able to develop, and I’ll see you at the movies.” Costner, of course, has been busy on the press tour for Horizon: An America Saga Chapter 1, the first of his four-part passion project that is coming to theaters June 28. It’s been known that Costner wouldn’t be returning to Yellowstone Season 5, Part 2 — which is currently filming in Montana and is set to premiere on Nov. 10. However, he didn’t exactly rule out a future appearance in the show during his Horizon press tour. “It might be an interesting moment to come back and finish the mythology of this modern-day family,” he recently told People. “And if that happens, I would step into it if I agreed with how it was being done.” Now that Costner knows he won’t be returning to Yellowstone, he can narrow his focus on Horizon, which follows the expansion of the West in the Civil War era. The second part is slated for an August release, while the third part recently began filming. “I don’t really fall out of love with things. When I finally decided I was just going to make it, [I said], ‘I’m going to bring the best movie I possibly can, and I’m not gonna fall out of love with it,’” Costner said on Thursday’s (June 20) broadcast of Today With Hoda & Jenna. He continued, “And suddenly, there were four [installments]. I was really happy that I was able to make them. It didn’t matter how it got made, it’s made.” Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1 premieres in theaters June 28.",

                    "text": "China has spent at least $230 billion on government support to electric vehicle makers such as BYD since 2009, according to a new study from the Centre for Strategic & International Studies think tank.The funding has played a crucial role in nurturing China's booming EV industry, which has prompted Europe to raise trade arriers amid fears of a wave of cheap EV exports.The European Union last week announced additional tariffs of up to 38% after concluding that Chinese firms were benefiting from unfair subsidies, allowing them to sell vehicles at far lower prices than their European rivals.Government subsidies have been a central pillar of China's quest to become an EV powerhouse over the past decade.China is now the world's largest electric vehicle market, accounting for 60% of global EV sales in 2023, per the IEA — well above rivals like the US and Japan.Many of its biggest companies are now making their mark on the global stage, with industry leader BYD briefly overtaking Tesla as the world's largest EV producer late last year.Data from CSIS showed that government support for China's electric vehicle market roughly tripled between 2017 and 2020, and hit before rising to an eye-watering $45 billion a year in both 2022 and 2023.EV makers in China can get government support through several routes, including infrastructure subsidies, tax exemptions, and buyer rebates.CSIS said the $230 billion figure was probably an underestimate, as it did not include support from regional governments, many of which have invested heavily in local EV companies. It also excluded subsidies for other parts of the EV supply chain such as battery manufacturing.Battery giant CATL, which controls about a third of the global market, received $809 million in government subsidies last year, CSIS estimated, double the sum in 2022.Massive government support has cultivated intense competition among China's legion of EV companies, which in turn has led to low prices. BYD's Seagull hatchback, one of the best-selling EVs, starts at less than $10,000 in China.By comparison, most EVs sold in the US are more expensive models, leaving America lagging behind China on the switch to electric.The Biden administration launched its own round of government support for electric vehicles through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes tax credits on US-made EVs that add up to a $7,500 subsidy.A study by Penn Wharton University published last year found that all the clean vehicle provisions in the Act would cost about $393 billion between 2023 and 2032.",

                    "text": "China has put a lot of cash into advancing its electric vehicle industry, which is set to account for 10 million sales this year in the world’s largest auto market. That’s a major achievement — but how much did it cost? At least $230.8 billion between 2009 and 2023, according to new research from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Funding over the first nine years the Washington-based think tank examined came out to about $6.74 billion per year, before tripling for the following three years, and then spiking again from 2021 onwards. The CSIS based its analysis on five areas: national rebate programs, government funding for beneficial infrastructure, research and development programs for EV makers, government purchases of electric cars, and exemption from China’s 10% sales tax. The buyer’s rebate — which ended in 2023 — and the sales tax exemption provided the bulk of Beijing’s support. And here’s the kicker: The CSIS says it’s probably lowballing it. The think tank says its data creates a “highly conservative estimate,” since it doesn’t include a number of factors. That includes rebate programs from local governments like Shanghai and Shenzhen, and low-cost land, credit, and electricity provided for EV companies. The CSIS also excluded subsidies for other parts of automakers’ supply chains, such as companies mining and processing raw materials and developing batteries. CATL, a titan of the EV battery industry that controlled more than a third of the global market last year, got $809.2 million in subsidies in 2023, up from $76.7 million five years prior. The Chinese market is overcrowded — 200 EV producers exist there — which has helped production and competition explode, and also led to price wars and increased exports. The European Union and U.S. are preparing to slap Chinese EV exports with tariffs of varying levels over the next two months to alleviate pressure on their domestic carmakers. The Biden administration’s new tariffs on imported EVs — of which there are very few — are aimed at protecting domestic autoworkers and manufacturers. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said the U.S. would not allow a second wave of the “China shock” of the early 2000s, when a flood of cheap Chinese imports helped kill about 2.4 million U.S. manufacturing jobs. The European Commission said it would put tariffs as high as 38% on some Chinese EV makers, on top of its existing 10% duties. In a statement earlier this month, the E.U.’s regulatory arm said “the battery electric vehicles value chain in China benefits from unfair subsidization, which is causing a threat of economic injury” to European companies. “[The] endurance of these subsidies is unlikely part of an intentional plot for global domination of this industry,” CSIS researcher Scott Kennedy wrote. More likely, he says, it’s a “byproduct of China’s inefficient industrial policy system in which support typically extends too long and is spread overly widely.”",

The statement from China’s Foreign Ministry said the company’s cooperation with Taiwan had violated the country’s sovereignty, standard terminology in its discussions of any outside dealings that support the island’s government. The effects of the sanctions appeared largely symbolic since military cooperation between the U.S. and China has been suspended since the People’s Liberation Army’s crackdown on student-led pro-democracy protests in Beijing and other cities in 1989. Named under the sanctions were Lockheed Martin Missile System Integration Lab, Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories and Lockheed Martin Ventures. Top executives James Donald Taiclet, Frank Andrew St. John and Jesus Malave were listed as banned from traveling to China. China has been steadily growing its domestic aircraft industry, producing parts, planes and services for Airbus and producing its own commercial jets. Foreign technology has played a large part in that process, but Chinese companies have increasingly developed the means to replace their overseas suppliers. Taiwan relies heavily on U.S. suppliers for arms, even as it works to boost its own defense industries and increase mandatory military service for men from four months to one year. That comes against the backdrop of China’s rising threat to encircle or invade Taiwan to achieve what it calls a historical mission to annex the island. Taiwan was formerly a Japanese colony and separated from mainland China amid civil war in 1949.",

The effects of the sanctions appeared largely symbolic since military cooperation between the U.S. and China has been suspended since the People’s Liberation Army’s crackdown on student-led pro-democracy protests in Beijing and other cities in 1989. Named under the sanctions were Lockheed Martin Missile System Integration Lab, Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories and Lockheed Martin Ventures.

                    "text": "SAMMAMISH, Wash. (AP) — Lexi Thompson knew some form of the question was coming after shooting a 4-under 68 and taking the first-round lead Thursday in the KPMG Women’s PGA Championship. Would a major title change her plans about retiring from playing full-time on the LPGA Tour? “I’m just taking it one day at a time. I made my announcement. I’m very content with it,” Thompson said. “Golf is a crazy game, so I’m not going to look too far ahead.” Thompson made six birdies on her way to a one-shot lead over Nelly Korda and Patty Tavatanakit. Teeing off in the afternoon as temperatures climbed into the 80s and dried out Sahalee Country Club, Thompson started hot with three straight birdies to open her round and built on last week when she lost in a playoff at the Meijer LPGA Classic. The 29-year-old Thompson, who recently announced her plans to retire after the season, shot a bogey-free 32 on the front nine, capped with a 6-foot birdie on the par-3 ninth. After a bogey at No. 10, Thompson rebounded with birdies at Nos. 12 and 14 before another bogey at the 16th. She won the last of her 11 LPGA Tour titles at the ShopRite LPGA Classic in June 2019. The 68 is her lowest round in a major since a 67 in the second round of the Women’s PGA two years ago at Congressional. “My approach shots felt great,” Thompson said. “They felt really good last week, so just trying to simplify things and get in a rhythm with my swing.” Korda shot 69 in the morning, and Tavatanakit matched it in the afternoon with a bogey-free round. The top-ranked Korda missed the cuts in the U.S. Women’s Open and the Meijer LPGA Classic in her last two starts after winning six of seven events, a run that started with a record-tying five straight victories. Korda started on the back nine and made four birdies on her first five holes. But parts of the morning were a scramble for Korda as the Douglass fir, red cedar and hemlock trees of Sahalee played their role in making it a challenge. A double bogey on the par-4 fourth hole dropped her back to 2 under. “If you try and be aggressive when you’ve hit it off line, it just bites you in the butt,” Korda said. “Overall, I think I played pretty well. I took my chances where I could and I played safe the majority of the round.” Korda made a 15-foot putt on the par-3 ninth hole — her final hole — to take the early lead. There was another group of players at 2 under, including Allisen Corpuz, Celine Boutier, Charley Hull and Leona Maguire. Maguire led this tournament after the third round last year at Baltusrol, but shot 74 on the final day and finished four shots back of the winner, Ruoning Yin. Playing with Korda, Yin rebounded from a rough start and shot 33 on her second nine to shoot 71. “Luckily hit it pretty straight today. Hit a lot of fairways and greens. But it does feel like a course where once you’re out of position it’s tough to get back on track,” said Corpuz, who has an outside chance of making the Olympics for the United States with a strong finish this week. The third major of the year on the LPGA Tour returned to Sahalee, which previously hosted in 2016. And the tree-lined course showed its difficulty. Lilia Vu, who won last week in her return from a back injury, shot 75. Yuka Saso, the U.S. Open winner three weeks ago, made four consecutive bogeys on the back nine and finished at 2-over 74. Brooke Henderson, who won in 2016, shot 73. Korda got off to a far better start than her last major, when she shot 80 in the opening round of the U.S. Women’s Open three weeks ago. Korda’s early run of birdies included three straight between Nos. 13-15 and she and went out in 33. She moved to 4 under after a birdie on the third hole — her 12th of the day — but dropped two shots on the fourth. “This entire golf course is so demanding,” Korda said. “I had to make some pretty good up-and-downs.” ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",

                    "text": "RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Nearly three decades after two young women were found with their throats slashed in Virginia’s Shenandoah National Park, federal authorities announced Thursday that they have identified a now-deceased serial rapist from Ohio as the person they believe was responsible for the killings. The bodies of Julianne “Julie” Williams, 24, and her partner, Laura “Lollie” Winans, 26, were found bound and gagged at their campsite in the park in 1996. The killings sent a wave of fear through the LGBTQ+ community, but the FBI said during a news conference Thursday that there is no evidence that the women were targeted because of their sexual orientation. The long-unsolved killings were reviewed by a new investigative team starting in 2021, said Stanley Meador, the Special Agent in Charge of the Richmond FBI office. Recently, a private lab pulled DNA from several pieces of evidence from the crime scene and sent the genetic profile to the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System, a database used by law enforcement agencies to match DNA to a criminal suspect. They got a positive match to Walter “Leo” Jackson Sr., a convicted rapist originally from the Cleveland, Ohio, area. Meador said the FBI then got DNA from the original swab taken from Jackson when he was charged in another rape in Ohio, which confirmed the match. He said the recent DNA testing found there is only a one in 2.6 trillion chance that the DNA found at the crime scene came from someone other than Jackson. This week, FBI officials were able to tell the families of the two women who they believe committed the killings, Meador said. “They’ve been seeking answers far too long.” Meador said. Jackson, who worked as a house painter, died in prison in 2018 in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, at age 70. He had served at least four separate prison terms after being convicted of kidnapping and multiple rapes and assaults. The recent retesting of crime scene evidence showed that both Williams and Winans were sexually assaulted, said Christopher Kavanaugh, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia. Kavanaugh said authorities investigated whether the rapes and killings could be considered hate crimes. But he said they found no evidence that Jackson knew of their sexual orientation or targeted them for that reason. “Make no mistake, this crime was brutal, this crime was definitely hateful, nevertheless we do not have any evidence” that the crime was motivated by anti-gay bias, Kavanaugh said. Authorities were vague when asked whether the same DNA testing could have been done years ago and identified the suspect earlier. In 2001, authorities arrested another man in the killings. Darrell David Rice, a computer programmer from Maryland, was charged with capital murder, and authorities alleged that he selected Williams and Winans because of his hatred of women and gay people. Rice had pleaded guilty in 1998 in the attempted abduction of a female bicyclist he tried to force into his truck, also in Shenandoah National Park. He was serving an 11-year prison sentence when he was charged with killing WIlliams and Winans. The charges were eventually dropped after forensic testing showed that hairs found at the crime scene ruled him out as a possible suspect. Williams, who was from St. Cloud, Minnesota, and Winans, who grew up in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, were both experienced hikers and were passionate about environmental issues, Kavanaugh said. They were hiking with a golden retriever named Taj when they were last seen by park personnel on May 24, 1996. Their bodies were discovered on June 1, 1996, at their campsite near Skyline Resort. Meador said the FBI is continuing to work with other law enforcement agencies to determine if Jackson is responsible for other unsolved crimes. “Our investigation will not stop,” he said.",

                    "title": "FBI Identifies Serial Rapist as Person Responsible for 1996 Shenandoah National Park Killings",
                    "text": "RICHMOND, Va.—Nearly three decades after two young women were found with their throats slashed in Virginia’s Shenandoah National Park, federal authorities announced Thursday that they have identified a now-deceased serial rapist from Ohio as the person they believe was responsible for the killings. The bodies of Julianne “Julie” Williams, 24, and her partner, Laura “Lollie” Winans, 26, were found bound and gagged at their campsite in the park in 1996. The killings sent a wave of fear through the LGBT community, but the FBI said during a news conference Thursday that there is no evidence that the women were targeted because of their sexual orientation. The long-unsolved killings were reviewed by a new investigative team starting in 2021, said Stanley Meador, the Special Agent in Charge of the Richmond FBI office. Recently, a private lab pulled DNA from several pieces of evidence from the crime scene and sent the genetic profile to the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System, a database used by law enforcement agencies to match DNA to a criminal suspect. They got a positive match to Walter “Leo” Jackson Sr., a convicted rapist originally from the Cleveland, Ohio, area. Meador said the FBI then got DNA from the original swab taken from Jackson when he was charged in another rape in Ohio, which confirmed the match. He said the recent DNA testing found there is only a one in 2.6 trillion chance that the DNA found at the crime scene came from someone other than Jackson. This week, FBI officials were able to tell the families of the two women who they believe committed the killings, Mr. Meador said. “They’ve been seeking answers far too long.” Mr. Meador said. Jackson, who worked as a house painter, died in prison in 2018 in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, at age 70. He had served at least four separate prison terms after being convicted of kidnapping and multiple rapes and assaults. The recent retesting of crime scene evidence showed that both Williams and Winans were sexually assaulted, said Christopher Kavanaugh, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia. Mr. Kavanaugh said authorities investigated whether the rapes and killings could be considered hate crimes. But he said they found no evidence that Jackson knew of their sexual orientation or targeted them for that reason. “Make no mistake, this crime was brutal, this crime was definitely hateful, nevertheless we do not have any evidence” that the crime was motivated by anti-gay bias, Mr. Kavanaugh said. Authorities were vague when asked whether the same DNA testing could have been done years ago and identified the suspect earlier. Williams, who was from St. Cloud, Minnesota, and Winans, who grew up in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, were both experienced hikers and were passionate about environmental issues, Mr. Kavanaugh said. They were hiking with a golden retriever named Taj when they were last seen by park personnel on May 24, 1996. Their bodies were discovered on June 1, 1996, at their campsite near Skyline Resort. Mr. Meador said the FBI is continuing to work with other law enforcement agencies to determine if Jackson is responsible for other unsolved crimes. “Our investigation will not stop,” he said.",

Louisiana will likely face a lawsuit from opposing groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Freedom From Religion Foundation, which say the law is “blatantly unconstitutional” “Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools,” Louisiana’s ACLU chapter said in a statement with the Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the FFRF. The Ten Commandments will be on display in every single public classroom on a poster no smaller than 11 inches by 14 inches. The Ten Commandments must also be “the central focus of the poster” and “in a large, easily readable font,” according to the legislation.

                    "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Former President Donald Trump weighed in on Louisiana’s controversial new law requiring schools to display a poster or framed document listing the Bible's Ten Commandments, saying it could be “the first major step in the revival of religion” that is “desperately needed” in the U.S. A Ten Commandments monument that was removed from the Alabama Judicial Building is on display during ... [+] the \"America for Jesus\" rally Oct. 22, 2004. Getty Images Key Facts “I LOVE THE TEN COMMANDMENTS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS, PRIVATE SCHOOLS, AND MANY OTHER PLACES, FOR THAT MATTER,” Trump said in the Truth Social post late Thursday night. Under the new law, every classroom in the state will be required to display the Ten Commandments—which include tenets like “Thou shalt have no other gods before me” and “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy”—alongside a four-paragraph statement calling the list of rules a “prominent part of American public education.\" A year before passing the Ten Commandments law, Louisiana passed another that requires the phrase \"In God We Trust” to be displayed on signage in every public school classroom and told instructors to teach students about the phrase as a “patriotic custom,” a move that has been criticized by some as a form of religious coercion. The governor of Oklahoma this June signed a bill that forces public school districts to allow students be released from school for up to three class periods per week to attend off-campus religious classes, which do not need to be taught by certified educators, and requires they be given credit for those classes (similar laws exist in Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and other states). Earlier this year, Texas education Commissioner Mike Morath introduced a new elementary curriculum that includes a number of stories from the Bible—he says the lessons use the Christian text to promote cultural and literary understanding, but critics say it’s an unnecessary infusion of religion to public school education. Texas and Florida last year both passed laws that allow unlicensed religious chaplains to serve as public school counselors, and some have already been hired. In Texas, the legislature called the law a response to a 2020 mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde and said the chaplains’ counseling could help prevent school shootings; in Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis said the chaplains could benefit troubled students who need “some soul craft.” Montana last year made it legal to begin the school day with prayer and passed a law allowing religious conversation and religious reading material, specifically the Bible, in the classroom.

Chief Critic Bills that intertwine religion and public school are often the subject of lawsuits from civil rights groups and others who say they violate the separation of church and state. The American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana has already said it will file a lawsuit in opposition to the Ten Commandment law and said it is in direct conflict with state law and violates the precedent set by the Supreme Court in the 1980 case Stone v. Graham. The court said in that case that the Ten Commandments \"had no secular legislative purpose\" and are \"plainly religious in nature,\" striking down a Kentucky law that would have required the text be posted in every classroom. The ACLU has also said that public school chaplain programs are dangerous policies that force religion upon students in what are meant to be secular spaces. Crucial Quote “The problem, of course, is that sometimes the legitimate reason of cultural literacy is used as a smokescreen to hide religious and ideological agendas,\" Mark Chancey, a religious studies professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, told The 74 of teaching religion in public school. Surprising Fact The Satanic Temple has said it will start providing classes for public school students in Oklahoma under the new religious instruction law. The organization has put out a sign up sheet for what it calls its Hellion Academy of Independent Learning, or HAIL, and spokesperson Lucien Greaves told a local news station the group has worked with educators to build curriculums. “The Satanic Temple believes that public schools should be entirely free from religious influence,” the group said. “Nevertheless, if other religious groups insist on forcing their way into our schools through legislation, we will ensure our members' children enjoy the same opportunities as those of other religious backgrounds” Key Background The Supreme Court has ruled on the issue of separation of church and state several times, most notably in Engle v. Vitale in 1962, in which it ruled school-sponsored prayer is a violation of the First Amendment. Lawsuits have long challenged the use of “In God We Trust” on government buildings, schools and other uses—like on currency—but the Supreme Court declined to hear a case on the issue in 2019. What To Watch For Nebraska is the latest state to propose school credit for religious classes attended outside of school, and legislators have proposed several other bills that mix religion with public education. State Sen. Loren Lippincott, the Republican who proposed the school credit bill, said getting a religious education will help students “develop a stronger sense of morality,” the Associated Press reported.

                    "text": "Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick is pledging to pass a bill that would require public school and college classrooms to display the Ten Commandments, days after a similar Louisiana measure became law. In a social media post, Patrick criticized Texas state House Speaker Dade Phelan, a Republican, for killing a state Senate bill that would have required the display of the Ten Commandments in schools. On Thursday, he vowed to bring the measure back. \"SB 1515 will bring back this historical tradition of recognizing America’s heritage, and remind students all across Texas of the importance of a fundamental foundation of American and Texas law: the Ten Commandments,\" Patrick wrote on X. \"Putting the Ten Commandments back into our schools was obviously not a priority for Dade Phelan.\" GOP ATTEMPTS TO DEFINE POSITION ON DISCARDING IVF EMBRYOS AMID PRO-LIFE STANCES The bill would require Texas public elementary and secondary schools to display the Ten Commandments in each classroom. No requirement is currently in place. Fox News Digital has reached out to Phelan's office. Phelan and Patrick had feuded after Patrick presided over the impeachment trial this year of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. LOUISIANA CLASSIFIES ABORTION DRUGS AS CONTROLLED, DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES AFTER GOV. LANDRY GREENLIGHTS PROPOSAL \"Texas WOULD have been and SHOULD have been the first state in the nation to put the 10 Commandments back in our schools,\" Patrick wrote on X. \"But, SPEAKER Dade Phelan killed the bill by letting it languish in committee for a month assuring it would never have time for a vote on the floor.\" This week, Louisiana became the first state to require the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public school classrooms. The American Civil Liberties Union and other civil rights groups said they plan to challenge the law. Notre Dame Law School Professor Richard W. Garnett, who is the director of the school’s Program on Church, State & Society, said it is likely several states will make efforts to mirror Louisiana. \"It remains to be seen whether these kinds of measures are permissible,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"The Supreme Court's doctrine has changed in some areas, but it hasn't changed in all areas.\" A key question for the high court will be whether a display like the Ten Commandments \"has a coercive effect\" on children given their age and that it's in a classroom setting, Garnett said. He noted that challengers of such laws will most likely point out that the U.S. is a religiously diverse nation and that public schools are run by the government for a \"pluralistic people\" despite the country's founding being inspired by some individuals' Christian convictions. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In a joint statement announcing their opposition to Louisiana's law, the ACLU and civil rights groups noted that religion is a private matter. \"The First Amendment promises that we all get to decide for ourselves what religious beliefs, if any, to hold and practice, without pressure from the government,\" the statement said. \"Politicians have no business imposing their preferred religious doctrine on students and families in public schools.\"",

The actor made the announcement in a video he shared on Instagram. “I just want to reach out and let you know that after this long year and a half of working on Horizon and doing all the things that’s required, and thinking about ‘Yellowstone,’ that beloved series that I love, that I know you love,” Costner said. “I just realized that I’m not going to be able to continue Season 5b or into the future.” He has been working on a multi-part film series, the first of which “Horizon: An American Saga,” is in theaters next week. He posted the video soon after the announcement that the much anticipated return of “Yellowstone” is happening November 10. Costner said of the show in which he played patriarch John Sutton, “It was something that really changed me. I loved it, and I know you loved it.” “I just wanted to let you know that I won’t be returning,” he said. “I love the relationship we’ve been able to develop, and I’ll see you at the movies.” Costner recently appeared on Howard Stern’s show and said he would only be returning if “the planets want to align up.” “Which means the storylines, the scripts and then I want to work more than once a year,” Costner said. “And to do that, times have to be set aside for things. When that couldn’t happen that can’t work for me anymore.” He also told Stern that he had a conversation with the show’s creator, Taylor Sheridan. “We both said what was important to us, and it doesn’t seem like we can [work things out],” Costner said. “My whole life has been about am I gonna stand tall even in some desperate situation where it doesn’t work for me.” Costner originated the role of John Sutton and said he absolutely believed the series could go on without him. He is co-writing, co-producing, directing and starring in the first “Horizon” film. “Horizon: An American Saga” debuts in theaters on June 28. The film is distributed by Warner Bros., which like CNN is part of Warner Bros. Discovery. The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.",

Instead, the Justice Department plans to offer Boeing what is known as a deferred prosecution agreement, which is often used to impose monitoring and compliance obligations on businesses accused of financial crimes or corruption, as opposed to trying to convict the company. The agreement will stipulate that Boeing install a federal monitor to oversee safety improvements, according to the people familiar with the situation. Federal prosecutors said in May that Boeing had violated a previous deferred prosecution agreement by failing to set up and maintain a program to detect and prevent violations of U.S. anti-fraud laws. The settlement was reached in 2021, after Boeing admitted in court that two of its employees had misled federal air safety regulators about a part that was at fault in the two crashes. The aircraft manufacturer’s violation of that settlement allowed the Justice Department to file criminal charges. But after an intense internal debate, department officials appear to have concluded that prosecuting Boeing would be too legally risky. Officials see the appointment of an independent watchdog as a quicker, more efficient way to ensure that the troubled company improves safety, manufacturing and quality control procedures.",

(Photo by JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images Key Facts Instead of criminally prosecuting Boeing, the Justice Department plans to offer the aerospace company a deferred prosecution agreement requiring it to install an independent government watchdog tasked with keeping track of safety and quality control, the Times reported, citing two anonymous sources. The Justice Department was able to seek prosecution of Boeing, which was charged with conspiracy to defraud the U.S., in May after federal officials said the company violated its 2021 prosecution agreement by “failing to design, implement and enforce a compliance and ethics program” made to detect and stop potential fraud violations. The installation of a federal monitor to supervise safety improvements at Boeing is seen by officials as a more efficient way to get the company to fall in line with safety and quality control improvements, according to the Times. The new settlement offer is expected to be given to Boeing within the month, though terms of the deal could still change, the Times noted.

Big Number $2.5 billion. That is the whopping figure Boeing agreed to pay in the settlement, which included $1.77 billion in compensation to be paid out to Boeing 737 Max airline customers, a $500 million crash-victim beneficiary fund and a criminal penalty totaling $243.6 million. Key Background Boeing’s 2021 settlement was reached after the company was accused of conspiracy to defraud the FAA’s aircraft evaluation arm in connection with the agency’s probe into the 737 Max airplane. Boeing admitted in court documents it misled the FAA about a part known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which automatically pushes down the nose of the aircraft when it detects too high of a pitch. Boeing’s cover-up led to pilots flying the 737 MAX for Boeing’s airline customers without being provided information on the system in manuals or training materials. The FAA concluded the system may have played a role in the 2018 and 2019 crashes that occurred near Indonesia and Ethiopia. The 2018 Indonesia crash killed all 189 passengers and crew on board while the 2019 crash killed 157.

                    "text": "The US Justice Department is considering a deal with Boeing that would see the aerospace giant avoid criminal prosecution but may appoint a federal supervisor to oversee company progress on safety improvements, The New York Times reported Friday.People familiar with the discussions told the daily that the terms of the possible alternative settlement, known as a deferred prosecution agreement, or DPA, are still subject to change.The Department of Justice (DOJ) is determining next steps after concluding in May that Boeing could be prosecuted for violating a criminal settlement following two fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 which together claimed 346 lives.But the Times, citing sources familiar with the discussions, reported that after substantial internal debate, Justice officials \"appear to have concluded that prosecuting Boeing would be too legally risky.\" Officials also reportedly believe that the appointment of a watchdog would be \"a quicker, more efficient way\" to ensure safety and quality control improvements are made, the newspaper said.Last month, the DOJ told the judge in the case that it would give its decision no later than July 7.The troubled planemaker had contested the department's review conclusions in mid-June, but it has recognized the gravity of the safety crisis and CEO Dave Calhoun told members of Congress that Boeing is \"taking action and making progress.\"In January 2021, Justice announced an initial DPA in which Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle fraud charges over certification of the 737 MAX. But since early 2023, the manufacturer has experienced multiple production and quality control problems on its commercial aircraft, as well as mid-flight incidents including in January when a panel known as a door plug flew off an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9.The DOJ says Boeing's violation of several provisions of the initial agreement, including measures requiring it to beef up its internal controls to detect and deter fraud, opened the company up to prosecution.Crash victims' families have called for the criminal prosecution of Boeing and its executives, and are seeking a nearly $25 billion fine.A new DPA would allow the US government to resolve the Boeing violations without a trial. That could serve as a victory of sorts for Boeing, a company seen as critical to the US aviation industry as well as national security.Such lawsuits in the past have forced companies into filing for bankruptcy, the Times reported, and a conviction could potentially prevent Boeing from receiving government contracts -- a substantial portion of its business.Boeing's defense, space and security segment generated some $25 billion in 2023, or nearly a third of the company's sales.",

                    "text": "Not that I usually feel reporters should be in the business of giving politicians pop quizzes, but for this, I'd make an exception. Now that Louisiana's Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has signed a clearly unconstitutional law requiring the Ten Commandments displayed in every public school and university classroom, it would be a good time to ask the law's supporters to list the commandments, in order. Most Republicans do a better job than Donald \"Two Corinthians\" Trump at performing Christian piety for the cameras, but still, it's a safe bet that few of the people reviving this tedious culture war flashpoint have read the actual Ten Commandments in quite a while. Many probably think \"thou shalt not watch 'RuPaul's Drag Race'\" is somewhere on there. Not that actually reciting them out loud would do Republicans any favors, either, as on any given day they're violating at least half of them. \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me\" is violated on an hourly basis, with the exaltation of Trump as their replacement Jesus. \"Thou shalt not bear false witness\" is a joke in an atmosphere where the GOP standard is to lie about everything: Why Trump got 34 felony convictions, whether or not storming a Capitol to overturn an election constitutes an insurrection, why one's house keeps manifesting January 6 flags. \"Thou shalt not steal\" seems like it would also cover Trump's efforts to steal a presidential election. Even in passing this law, Louisiana Republicans are violating the spirit of \"honor thy father,\" as they thumb their nose at the men they love to call the Founding Fathers. The founders were quite clear in their intentions for a secular state, in no small part to avoid exactly the conflict that is being teed up here. About one-third of Americans aren't Christian, a percentage that rises to almost 40% when looking at people under 30. Mandatory Christian iconography — and that's how this is meant, no matter how much they disingenuously toss the word \"Judeo\" around — sends a clear and unmistakable message: Only Christians are \"real\" Americans. Want more Amanda Marcotte on politics? Subscribe to her newsletter Standing Room Only. Which is to say, Louisiana Republicans are signing onto an overt Christian nationalist agenda. This isn't about wanting to \"respect the rule of law,\" as Landry claimed or he would respect the First Amendment. It certainly isn't morality from a party lined up behind Trump, who is breaking multiple commandments at any hour of the day. It really isn't about sincere religious faith, either, which is being polluted by this association with open bigotry and crass politicking. In a too on-the-nose symbol of how little Republicans actually care about the children they claim to champion, a little girl appeared to pass out during the bill signing, while Landry and his cohorts ignore her. It would be easy to shrug this off, of course. Making a stink about mandatory, taxpayer-funded displays of the 10 commandments has been a go-to political stunt for Republicans for decades. The last big fight over this was a little over a decade ago, when Oklahoma Republicans, no doubt as a psychological defense mechanism to cope with seeing a Black president, put one of these monuments up at the state capitol, only to have their own courts later rule it violated state religious liberty laws. In an age when democracy's very existence is threatened, these battles over symbols might seem like penny ante stuff. But this is much more serious than that, and not just because, as the Sam Alito flag controversy shows, symbols do matter. This law builds on years of the Supreme Court chipping away at both religious freedom and the separation of church and state. It's an open invitation to the court to go even further, and strike down the very premise that the U.S. government should not be telling its citizens what gods to worship or what religious strictures control their lives. This isn't just Republicans taking a petty swipe at their neighbors who believe differently than they do. It's about the ongoing threat of encroaching theocracy. Landry isn't hiding that fact, either. \"I can’t wait to be sued,\" he crowed at a Republican fundraiser last week. In the same speech, notably, he denounced Trump's 34 felony convictions. The number of commandments Trump broke in the series of events that led to the conviction, by the way: At least seven, including adultery, stealing, coveting, false witness and, hilariously, breaking the Sabbath, since the golf tournament all this sinning happened it was on a Sunday. Louisiana Republicans clearly hope to get this case in front of the Supreme Court, which has been on quite a tear recently, and offered tortured decisions justifying the use of government power and taxpayer funds to foist conservative Christian beliefs on the non-consenting. In 2022, the court ignored decades of First Amendment precedent to rule that a high school football coach can bully his students into Christian prayer. In the same month, they also ruled — again violating decades of precedent — that the state of Maine has to pay for religious schools that not only have Bible classes but teach far-right beliefs, such as the immorality of homosexuality. In 2023, they ruled that opponents of LGBTQ rights can ignore anti-discrimination law, as long as the bigots claim religious motives. With the rise of explicitly racist rhetoric inside Christian nationalist circles, it may not be long before we see people who want to run whites-only businesses also claiming a \"religious\" exemption from the law. To underscore how this is not just about symbols, but about people's ability to live freely, we should add Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health to the pile. During oral arguments over abortion bans, Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out that state interest in banning abortion is nothing \"but a religious view.\" This really is indisputable. There's no scientific reason to ban abortion. In fact, all evidence shows abortion bans are quite harmful to both individual and public health. When outside of court, and often even inside it, abortion opponents don't even bother to hide that this is about imposing their religious rules about sexuality and procreation on the majority of Americans who disagree. When we're talking about theocracy, it's about more than having to see religious iconography in a public classroom or even being forced to play along while a teacher makes kids pray. It's the Christian right snaking its way into the most intimate parts of people's lives, using \"Jesus\" as an excuse to tell us who we can love, whether we can marry or divorce, and when we should have children — even as they can't or won't follow their own religious rules. As with all things MAGA, rules are forever only for other people.",

The Supreme Court effectively struck them down in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, later that year, by giving them a Hobson’s choice of sorts. “A state need not subsidize private education,” Roberts again wrote for a 5–4 majority. “But once a state decides to do so, it cannot disqualify some private schools solely because they are religious.” Though it was technically decided on free exercise clause grounds, some of the conservative justices in Espinoza wanted to revisit the court’s establishment clause precedents as well. Justice Clarence Thomas urged his colleagues to revisit the matter in future cases in a concurring opinion joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch. “The Court’s current understanding of the Establishment Clause actually thwarts, rather than promotes, equal treatment of religion,” he wrote. “Under a proper understanding of the Establishment Clause, robust and lively debate about the role of religion in government is permitted, even encouraged, at the state and local level.” In perhaps the most telling case, the Supreme Court sided with a high school football coach in Washington state, two years ago, who claimed he was fired for holding a “quiet personal prayer.” That description defied ample contemporary reports that the coach in question had led highly publicized prayers with students at school events and that some student-athletes felt pressured to join them—a disturbing First Amendment violation in and of itself. But the court’s conservative justices embraced the coach’s story nonetheless. He retook his old job, coached a single game, and then retired to hit the conservative media circuit.",

The new law, signed on Wednesday by the hard-right governor, Jeff Landry, puts Louisiana in the vanguard of a decades-long movement to obliterate the foundational US separation of church and state. It puts wind in the sails of those who want the US to be reinvented as an overtly Christian nation, and comes in the wake of two highly contentious opinions from the highest court. Both rulings, delivered within six days of each other in 2022, were backed by the six ultra-conservative justices who now have a stranglehold on the country’s most powerful court. The supermajority is one of the main legacies of Donald Trump, who placed three of the justices on the bench. The 2022 decisions chipped away at the bedrock principle that has guided the US since its inception. Enshrined in the first amendment of the US constitution, it stipulates that all faiths should be free to worship, yet none enjoy priority status as an established state religion. “There’s no question that Christian nationalists are capitalizing on the recent supreme court cases. They are hopeful that the court is beyond repair and will undo years of precedent about religion in public schools,” said Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the Freedom from Religion Foundation which is part of a coalition of groups challenging the new Louisiana law in the courts. The first of the supreme court’s radical rulings, Carson v Makin, was delivered on 21 June 2022. In it, the conservative justices required the state of Maine to fund religious instruction in rural areas lacking a public high school – a command that flew in the face of the specific edict of James Madison, the main author of the first amendment, against taxpayers funding religious activity including education. In a dissenting opinion, the liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor bluntly accused her rightwing peers of dismantling “the wall of separation between church and state that the framers fought to build”. The second ruling, issued less than a week later on 27 June 2022, landed an even greater punch on the settled law relating to church-state relations. The decision, Kennedy v Bremerton, in effect overturned more than 40 years of supreme court precedent – it was as audacious and extreme a measure in the field of religion as the Dobbs ruling, which overturned Roe v Wade in that of abortion. The Kennedy case concerned a football coach, Joe Kennedy, who had been placed on administrative leave by his public school outside Seattle after he repeatedly ignored instructions and held prayer sessions with student players after games on the 50-yard line. Kennedy falsely claimed the prayers were “personal” and “private”, when in fact he had a long track record of leading student athletes in prayer stretching back years. The supreme court opinion, in siding with Kennedy, scrapped what has become known as the Lemon test, which since its elucidation in 1971 has clarified for judges how they should view whether government actions touching upon religion are constitutional. The test said that the courts had to consider whether such action had a “secular legislative purpose” – it should neither advance nor inhibit religion, and must avoid fostering “an excessive government entanglement with religion”. The Kennedy ruling, written by one of Trump’s appointees, Neil Gorsuch, threw out that tried and tested formula and replaced it with a far more vague prescription based on “history of tradition”. Such woolly definitions are proving popular among the all-powerful rightwingers – they applied exactly the same recipe to the regulation of guns in their 2021 Bruen ruling, with similarly explosive results. Sotomayor’s response to Kennedy v Bremerton was even more visceral than her previous outburst. She wrote a 35-page dissenting opinion that was longer than Gorsuch’s majority ruling. It was certainly more angry. Sotomayor said the decision put the constitutional right to the free exercise of faith ahead of the establishment clause which prohibits government from forming an established religion. She pointed out that legal precedent demanded that those two potentially conflicting precepts should be ranked equally. “This decision does a disservice to schools and the young citizens they serve, as well as to our nation’s longstanding commitment to the separation of church and state,” the justice wrote. Then she gave a chilling prediction: “In doing so, the court sets us further down a perilous path in forcing states to entangle themselves with religion, with all of our rights hanging in the balance.” Louisiana’s governor must have been paying attention. By signing the new Ten Commandments law he has fulfilled Sotomayor’s warning. He is taking the US down a perilous path that is all but certain to lead to the supreme court. The same supreme court that opened this Pandora’s box, and that shows no desire to close it.",

                    "text": "A third American who was arrested in the Turks and Caicos Islands in recent months for possessing ammunition was given a suspended sentence of 13 weeks in prison and a $2,000 fine Friday, his spokesperson said on social media.Ryan Watson of Oklahoma had pleaded guilty and faced a potential prison sentence over four rounds of ammunition that were found in his carry-on bag when he and his wife visited the British territory earlier this year.Watson has been out on bail for weeks as his case moved through the islands' legal system, but he wasn't allowed to return to his wife, Valerie Watson, and their two children in the U.S. until his case was resolved.According to spokesperson Jonathan Franks, the judge found that the case had exceptional circumstances and that the lengthy sentence would be arbitrary. \"We will make payment shortly, depart TCI and anticipate being home in OKC tonight,\" Franks tweeted Friday. Watson was arrested on April 12 when four rounds of hunting ammunition were found in his carry-on luggage as the couple were trying to head home from a vacation. Valerie Watson was allowed to return to the U.S. and didn't face any charges.Ryan Watson told CBS News in April that he regretted the ordeal and didn't intend to break any of the islands' laws.\"There was zero intent behind this and this was 100% a mistake and an accident,\" Watson said.Two other Americans who were arrested under similar circumstances were sentenced last month. Bryan Hagerich of Pennsylvania received a suspended sentence and a $6,700 fine for possessing 20 rifle rounds that were found in his checked bag on a family vacation. Tyler Wenrich of Virginia was sentenced to time served and a $9,000 fine over two 9 mm rounds that were found in his backpack as he was trying to board a cruise ship. Both men have returned to the U.S.Hagerich and Wenrich faced potential mandatory minimum sentences of 12 years in prison, but the courts found that there were exceptional circumstances in their cases, which resulted in lighter punishments for the Americans. Amid calls from members of the U.S. Congress to show leniency to the Americans, island lawmakers have reconsidered the mandatory minimum sentence for firearms offenses. According to local news outlet The Sun, the House of Assembly voted on June 14 to approve an amendment allowing judges more discretion in sentencing when they find there are exceptional circumstances.Florida grandmother Sharitta Grier's case is still pending on the islands. She was arrested in May after two bullets were allegedly found in her carry-on bag when she was going home from a surprise Mother's Day vacation.A fifth American, Michael Lee Evans of Texas, was allowed to return to the U.S. for medical reasons while he is out on bail.",

Trump.

The Missouri AG specifically poked Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for acting politically when he successfully secured a guilty verdict. \"We have to fight back against a rogue prosecutor who is trying to take a presidential candidate off the campaign trail,\" Bailey added in another tweet clearly aimed at Bragg, but not naming him. Bailey charged \"radical progressives in New York [for] trying to rig the 2024 election,\" according to Fox News. \"We have to stand up and fight back.\" When Bragg ran for Manhattan district attorney in 2021 it was on a platform of “justice and public safety.\" And when he was asked about the criminal investigation into Trump and how Cyrus Vance Jr., the outgoing DA didn't bring a formal charge, Bragg expressed his intentions. “I don’t know where this investigation will go. I don’t want to prejudge it. But, these types of investigations — white-collar investigations — I’ve been involved with for years, both doing them myself and also supervising them,” he said at the time. The lawsuit comes weeks ahead of a primary where Bailey is fighting to keep his AG post in a fierce GOP contest.

Some have referred to this effort to deny voters a choice and thereby decide the election by undemocratic means as \"lawfare.\" Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey (R) revealed Thursday that such attacks will not go unanswered. Bailey noted on X that he would be \"filing suit against the State of New York for their direct attack on our democratic process through unconstitutional lawfare against President Trump. It's time to restore the rule of law.\" According to the Republican, the efforts of \"rogue prosecutor\" New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg to \"take a presidential candidate off the campaign trail ... sabotages Missourians' right to a free and fair election.\" Last week, Bailey testified before the House Judiciary Committee. He noted in his written statement that the \"left has prioritized its hatred of President Trump above the rule of law.\" 'The prosecution was politically motivated and replete with legal error.' \"Government officials at the federal and state levels have censored President Trump, filed civil suits in order to sanction him, illegally removed him from the ballot, and perverted the law in order to prosecute him,\" wrote Bailey. The Missouri AG indicated further that Bragg's prosecution of Trump, in particular, \"represents one of the most morally abhorrent volleys in the left's on-going barrage of lawfare. The prosecution was politically motivated and replete with legal error.\" Among the issues Bailey highlighted with Trump's prosecution in New York — which are likely to be raised in his forthcoming lawsuit — were: Bragg's \"disqualifying impropriety,\" reflected in part by his refusal to recuse himself despite an obvious self-interest in the case;the indictment charges' \"reference to an unspecified and unidentifiable other crime,\" which altogether \"constitutes a deprivation of due process by denying the defendant his Sixth Amendment right to be informed of the crimes with which he is charged\";the prosecutor's efforts to have Trump silenced with an \"unconstitutional gag order\";Bragg's perversion of \"the law to meet the facts rather than objectively apply the facts to the law,\" namely through the expansion of the charges beyond the text of the statute at issue in order to criminalize \"that which he does not like rather than that which the law forbids\"; andBragg's failure to \"correct the Court's error in instructing the jury that unanimity was not required as to the predicate offense that forms the basis for the fallacious charges.\" Bailey further highlighted in his testimony the apparent \"collusion\" between the Biden Department of Justice and the New York District Attorney's Office regarding the initiative to take Trump off the board. Bailey's office expects that lawsuit will go straight to the U.S. Supreme Court and will be titled \"Missouri vs. New York,\" reported Fox News Digital. Extra to announcing that Missouri would be suing New York Thursday, Bailey filed an amicus brief with 23 other red states urging the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, which is overseeing Trump's classified documents case, to reject Special Prosecutor Jack Smith's request for an \"unconstitutional gag order\" on Trump. Smith asked Judge Aileen Cannon that the conditions permitting Trump to await trial outside of jail should be updated to include a gag order, prohibiting him from commenting about details of his case, particularly about the raid on his Mar-a-Lago residence. Trump's attorneys said in a filing last week, \"Like Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Smith seeks to restrict President Trump’s campaign speech as the first presidential debate approaches at the end of this month,\" reported CNN. The amicus brief filed by Bailey and other Republican attorneys general, stressed that fair and free elections \"depend on candidates' ability to speak about important issues of the day.\" \"When agents of one candidate seek a court order to muzzle discussion on matters relating to important electoral issues, that restraint raises even more fundamental First Amendment concerns,\" continued the brief.

President Joe Biden initially loosened the restrictions on how Ukraine could use U.S.-provided munitions to give it another option to better defend the eastern city of Kharkiv from a relentless barrage of Russian missiles. Since the beginning of Russia’s 2022 invasion, the U.S. had maintained a policy of not allowing Ukraine to use the weapons it provided to hit targets inside Russia for fear of further escalating the war. Russia has been firing on Ukrainian targets from inside its border, treating its area as a “safe zone,” said Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary. “As we see those forces conducting those types of operations from across the border, we’ve explained Ukraine can and does have the right to fire back to defend themselves,” Ryder told reporters Thursday. The White House also announced Thursday that it is rushing delivery of air defense interceptor missiles to Ukraine by redirecting shipments planned for other allied nations, as Washington scrambles to counter increased Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. The U.S. was already sending Ukraine a consistent stream of interceptors for its air defense systems, including for the Patriot missile batteries and the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, or NASAMS.

The moon is expected at 9:08 p.m. Eastern Standard Time and will be opposite to the sun, according to NASA.

Mead, known in some countries as honey wine, is created by fermenting honey with fruits or other spices. Meanwhile, the term \"honeymoon\" dates back to Europe in the 1500s and references getting married in June because it's the \"sweetest\" moon of the year. The moon will take on a reddish orange color due to how low it will hang in the sky and its close proximity to the horizon. Because of how low the moon will be, that also means the sky will be darker due to lower levels of moonlight.",

                    "text": "By OLEG CETINIC and ELISE MORTON (Associated Press) PARIS (AP) — The alleged rape of a 12-year-old Jewish girl in a suspected antisemitic attack has sent shockwaves throughout France, and thrust concerns about antisemitism to the forefront of campaigning for the country’s legislative elections. The National Rally party, which has tried to shed historical links to antisemitism, has its first real chance of forming a government if it comes out on top of the two-round elections that end July 7, as polls forecast. It would be the first far-right force to lead a French government since the Nazi occupation. Far-left figures, meanwhile, have faced accusations of antisemitism linked to their response to Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the ensuing war. Concerns came to the fore after two adolescent boys in a Paris suburb were given preliminary charges this week of raping a 12-year-old girl and religion-motivated violence, according to prosecutors. Lawyer and Jewish leader Elie Korchia told French broadcaster BFM that the girl is Jewish and that the word Palestine was mentioned during the attack. Politicians from all sides were quick to comment on the attack, which elicited widespread shock and concern, notably after a surge in antisemitic acts in France since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. France has the largest Jewish population in Europe, but given its own World War II collaboration with the Nazis, antisemitic acts today open old scars. France also has the largest Muslim population in western Europe, and anti-Muslim acts have risen in recent years. On Wednesday evening, hundreds of people gathered in front of Paris City Hall to protest antisemitism. Many in the crowd were holding placards, including some bearing the slogan “raped because she’s Jewish.” Further protests are planned for Thursday evening at Place de la Bastille. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal wrote on X that the girl was “raped because she’s Jewish,” identifying it as an antisemitic attack, while French President Emmanuel Macron called on schools to hold a “discussion hour” on racism and antisemitism. Jordan Bardella, president of the National Rally, said that if elected he would “fight the antisemitism that has been plaguing France since Oct. 7.” In the wake of reports of the attack, Bardella announced that his party was withdrawing support for one of its candidates over an antisemitic message on social media posted in 2018. His predecessor as party president and the National Rally’s 2022 presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, accused the “extreme left” of “stigmatization of Jews” and of “instrumentalizing” the Israel-Hamas conflict. Leftist leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon denounced “antisemitic racism,” though the France Unbowed party which he formerly led has itself faced accusations of antisemitism linked to the Israel-Hamas war. Although the alleged rape has heightened tensions regarding antisemitism in France before the June 30 and July 7 two-round parliamentary election, it is far from a new issue in French politics. More than 180,000 people across France, including 100,000 in Paris, marched in November to protest rising antisemitism in the wake of Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza — the biggest gathering to denounce antisemitism in France since a 1990 demonstration against the desecration of a Jewish cemetery. Along with then-Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne and representatives of several other parties, Le Pen attended the march amid fierce criticism that her once-pariah National Rally party had failed to shake off its antisemitic heritage despite growing political legitimacy. Borne, who is the daughter of a Jewish Holocaust survivor, tweeted that “the presence of the National Rally is not fooling anyone.” Party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine Le Pen’s father, was convicted repeatedly of antisemitic hate speech and played down the scope of the Holocaust. Marine Le Pen — runner-up in the last two presidential elections and likely a top contender in 2027 — has worked to scrub the party’s image, kicking her father out and changing its name from National Front to National Rally. Attal announced in May that “366 antisemitic acts” were recorded between January and March this year, an increase of 300% compared to the first three months of 2023. ___ Morton reported from London.",

Arié Alimi, lawyer and vice president of the League of Human Rights, called for a united front against the far right. “For some time now there is an awareness that there is antisemitism also on the left and that we need to address it,” he said at Thursday’s demonstration. ‘’Today it’s the camp of the left, of progressives that is gathered with all people who are worried by antisemitism and all kinds of racism in France, in a particular political moment with a far right that could possibly come to power.” Although the alleged rape has heightened tensions regarding antisemitism in France before the June 30 and July 7 two-round parliamentary election, it is far from a new issue in French politics.

Antisemitism refers to hatred of Jews, but there is no universally agreed definition of what exactly it entails or how it relates to criticism of Israel. The Israeli government regularly accuses its opponents of antisemitism, while critics say it uses the term to silence opposition to its policies. The war has reignited the long debate about the definition of antisemitism and whether any criticism of Israel — from its military’s killing of thousands of Palestinian children to questions over Israel’s very right to exist — amounts to anti-Jewish hate speech. ___ By OLEG CETINIC and ELISE MORTON Associated Press Morton reported from London.",

Jordan Bardella, president of the National Rally, said that if elected, he would “fight the antisemitism that has been plaguing France since Oct. 7.” In the wake of reports of the attack, Bardella announced that his party was withdrawing support for one of its candidates over an antisemitic message on social media posted in 2018. His predecessor as party president and the National Rally’s 2022 presidential candidate, Marine Le Pen, accused the “extreme left” of “stigmatization of Jews” and of “instrumentalizing” the Israel-Hamas conflict. Leftist leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon denounced “antisemitic racism,” though the France Unbowed party which he formerly led has itself faced accusations of antisemitism linked to the Israel-Hamas war. “There has never been any ambiguity in our denunciation of antisemitism,” lawmaker Manuel Bompard of France Unbowed said on French news broadcaster La Chaîne Info on Wednesday, pushing back on accusations that his party’s stance on antisemitism and the Israel-Hamas war contributed to an environment of insecurity for French Jews. “To have people believe that there would be a link between what happened and France Unbowed’s political positions is offensive and inappropriate,” he said. Arié Alimi, lawyer and vice president of the League of Human Rights, called for a united front against the far right. “For some time now there is an awareness that there is antisemitism also on the left and that we need to address it,’’ he said at Thursday’s demonstration. ‘’Today it’s the camp of the left, of progressives that is gathered with all people who are worried by antisemitism and all kinds of racism in France, in a particular political moment with a far right that could possibly come to power.’’ Although the alleged rape has heightened tensions regarding antisemitism in France before the June 30 and July 7 two-round parliamentary election, it is far from a new issue in French politics. More than 180,000 people across France, marched in November to protest rising antisemitism in the wake of Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza. Along with then-Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne and representatives of several other parties, Le Pen attended the march amid fierce criticism that her once-pariah National Rally party had failed to shake off its antisemitic heritage despite growing political legitimacy. Borne, the daughter of a Jewish Holocaust survivor, tweeted that “the presence of the National Rally is not fooling anyone.” Party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine Le Pen’s father, was convicted repeatedly of antisemitic hate speech and played down the scope of the Holocaust. Marine Le Pen — runner-up in the last two presidential elections and likely a top contender in 2027 - has worked to scrub the party’s image, kicking her father out and changing its name from National Front to National Rally. Attal announced in May that “366 antisemitic acts ” were recorded between January and March this year, an increase of 300% compared to the first three months of 2023. Antisemitism refers to hatred of Jews, but there is no universally agreed definition of what exactly it entails or how it relates to criticism of Israel. The Israeli government regularly accuses its opponents of antisemitism, while critics say it uses the term to silence opposition to its policies. The war has reignited the long debate about the definition of antisemitism and whether any criticism of Israel - from its military’s killing of thousands of Palestinian children to questions over Israel’s very right to exist - amounts to anti-Jewish hate speech. ___ Morton reported from London.",

                    "text": "A family of taekwondo instructors in Texas helped stop a man allegedly attempting to assault a woman and subdued him until authorities arrived, police said. The An family of Cypress, Texas — who own and operate the Yong-In Taekwondo Academy in the nearby Houston suburb of Katy — were going about their day in the dojo on Tuesday, June 18, when they heard a woman scream. Simon An, 20, told The Washington Post and local CBS affiliate station KHOU that he and his father, Han An, 59, immediately sprung into action. The pair ran next door to a cell phone store to find a man on top of a woman, holding his hand over her mouth and touching her, Simon told the Post. Han, an 8th-degree black belt, grandmaster and veteran of the South Korean military, attempted to pin down the man to prevent him from leaving, Simon said. \"He just kept him in the corner, he just kept pushing down. Automatic self-defense, automatic taekwondo style,\" Simon told KHOU, recalling how his father prevented the alleged assailant from escaping. Simon also alleged that the man bit his father amid the struggle. The college student said he jumped into action to help Han, telling the Post that he kicked and punched the alleged attacker. \"Adrenaline just shot up, through the roof. No limit,\" Simon told the newspaper. \"I was kind of shaking.\" His mother Hong, 55 and sister, Hannah, 22, guided the alleged victim to safety in their dojo, and brother Christian, 18, locked the building's entrance. \"[We were] making sure that she's OK, because she needed that after that experience — after that situation that happened out of nowhere,\" Hannah told KHOU. According to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, when police arrived at the scene, the family was still holding the suspect in place. \"By utilizing their training and discipline, they managed to stop the assault and hold him,\" Gonzalez wrote on Wednesday, June 19, in a post on X. \"Deputies obtained charges for attempted sexual assault and unlawful detention on behalf of the survivor and assault on behalf of the instructors.\" The sheriff also praised the family as \"group of good samaritans\" who rushed to \"save the day.\" \"Thank you to the Yong-In dojo for your quick action in protecting others,\" Gonzalez finished. Gonzalez later identified the alleged attacker as 19-year-old Alex Robinson. KHOU reported that Robinson appeared in court that night on a sexual assault charge, and his attorney asked for a low bond, citing mental health concerns. The judge set his bond at $100,000. The Ans told both outlets that although they've trained for years to hone their fighting skills, they hope anyone — regardless of their black-belt status — would step in to intervene.

I'm very proud of my family,\" he told KHOU. Hannah also chimed in, telling the local station that although she's thankful to those who called the family heroes, she hopes that anyone witnessing an attack of that nature would step in. \"I thank everybody who's calling us that, but still, I think anybody can do it,\" she said. If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, please contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673) or go to rainn.org.",

                    "text": "KATY, Texas — A woman who was being attacked by a teen male was rescued when a family trained in taekwondo heard her yelling and subdued the suspect, authorities say. A news release from the Harris County Sheriff’s Office says the incident occurred Tuesday. The victim was working at a cellphone store when the suspect attempted to sexually assault her. Instructors at the Yong-In Taekwondo Dojo, which is next door to the cellphone store, heard the woman yelling and went to see what was wrong. The sheriff’s office says the instructors — identified by ABC News as Han An, wife Hong An and their three children, Hannah, Simon and Christian — were able to pull the woman away from the suspect. All of them are black belts. “When we already opened the door, the male was on top of the female already ... inside the employees’ room,” Hannah An tells ABC News. “So, by that moment, my dad grabbed him, dragged him out, and the girl was really, really crying, desperately crying, and then she ran toward me. She needed the comfort, the calming down, and then she wanted to go away from that situation.” The sheriff’s office says the suspect then attempted to attack the family members. “By utilizing their training and discipline, they managed to stop the assault and hold him,” the news release says. ABC News reports the suspect did bite Han An twice. “It just happened so sudden,” Simon An tells NBC News. “It was all self-defense. The intruder was trying to run away — scratching, biting, anything he could do.” Hong An held the suspect down for 10 minutes until deputies arrived, reports say. The suspect, Alex Robinson, 19, of Katy, Texas, is charged with assault, attempted sexual assault and unlawful detention, the sheriff’s office says. He is being held on a $100,000 bond. “Thank you to the Yong-In dojo for your quick action in protecting others,” the news release says.",

The An family sprung into action after hearing the victim’s unsettling shrieks from inside a mobile phone store next to their martial arts studio, Yong-In Tae Kwon Do, in Cypress on Tuesday afternoon, authorities said. Grandmaster Han An, an eighth-degree black belt and South Korean military vet, quickly sprinted outside — trailed closely by his wife and their three kids. They found the suspect, identified by cops as 19-year-old Alex Robinson, allegedly attacking the woman and trying to hold his hand over her mouth. It took just moments for An to take the alleged perp out with a kick and punch. “He just kept him in the corner, he just kept pushing down. Automatic self-defense, automatic taekwondo style,” An’s son, Simon An, 20, told KHOU. “You wouldn’t really expect it in an everyday situation, but when the time comes, it’s very valuable,” he added of the family’s martial arts training. An’s wife, Hong, and their daughter, Hannah, quickly rushed the victim next door to the safety of their taekwondo studio until cops descended on the scene. “Making sure that she’s okay because she needed that after that experience — after that situation that happened out of nowhere,” Hannah, 22, told the outlet. Authorities found the An family still holding Robinson to the ground when they arrived, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said. “By utilizing their training and discipline, they managed to stop the assault and hold him,” the sheriff said in a statement. Robinson was cuffed and later charged with attempted sexual assault, unlawful detention, and assault on the instructors.",

                    "text": "GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany — Europe beware – Spain might just be back. The three-time European champion advanced to the round of 16 at Euro 2024 after a 1-0 win against holder Italy on Thursday. A 55th-minute own goal by Riccardo Calafiori settled the Group B game at the Veltins Arena in Gelsenkirchen. But that didn’t begin to tell the story of a statement performance from Spain, which surely marks it as one of the favorites to win a record-extending fourth European Championship. “I think it was the best Spain performance I have taken charge of,” coach Luis de la Fuente said. “I don’t see a ceiling on this team. The sky is the limit.” Spain totally dominated defending champion Italy, with 16-year-old winger Lamine Yamal further enhancing his reputation as one of soccer’s most exciting young stars. Player of the match Nico Williams also tormented Italy’s defenders and was the width of the crossbar away from scoring in the second half. It took Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to keep the score down with a string of fine saves until inadvertently pushing the ball into the legs of Calafiori, who couldn’t prevent it from ricocheting into his own goal. “They deserved to win and we were never in the game,” Italy coach Luciano Spalletti said. “There was too much of a gulf. We were constantly stretched, we were never able to squeeze the gaps between the various units and they were able to cause us problems. They caused us more problems than the scoreline suggests, let’s not beat around the bush.” Spain produced a throwback performance that brought to mind the years when it ruled international soccer when winning back-to-back Euros and the World Cup from 2008 through 2012. Having failed to dominate possession for the first time in 136 competitive games in its opening 3-0 win over Croatia, Spain was back to its old ways in starving Italy of the ball and dictating play in a largely lopsided game. Chances came thick and fast in the first half, with Donnarumma pulling off a string of saves to keep the score goalless. For all of Spain’s superiority, it took Calafiori’s own goal to break the deadlock after halftime. Donnarumma pushed Alvaro Morata’s glancing header into the legs of Calafiori, who could only watch as the ball ricocheted into the back of the net. Williams was then millimeters away from extending the lead with a curling shot that hit crossbar. “We dominated across the board,” Williams said. “Italy are an excellent side but we played very well and deserved to win.” Williams is just one of the bright young stars in De la Fuente’s team. Yamal is another and the Barcelona teenager, who has a $1 billion buyout clause, showcased his talents with slaloming runs and tricks. Barcelona midfielder Pedri looks like the modern-day answer to Spain great Andres Iniesta. “I want to underline the quality of this generation of players, particularly those in this squad. Spanish players are the best in the world,” De la Fuente said. Spain has endured frustrating times since it last won the Euros in 2012, with early exits from the last three World Cups. At the last Euros, it lost on penalties to Italy in the semifinals. But there have been signs of its resurgence in recent times, having won the UEFA Nations League last year. Now it looks well-positioned to add another major title in Germany. “Essentially we haven’t achieved anything yet,” De la Fuente said. “Football can be very cruel. We have to be cautious, humble and show respect.” England 1, Denmark 1 A draw Thursday with Denmark — a semifinalist last time, don’t forget — means England is unbeaten and all-but certain to advance to the round of 16. It also was a slack, mistake-filled display that left coach Gareth Southgate angrily gesturing at his players for gifting a slew of scoring chances late in the game. “The team didn’t function today, that is my responsibility,” said Southgate, who heard jeers from fans behind the England goal in a ragged second half. Harry Kane gave England another fast start at Euro 2024, scoring it the 18th minute, but the captain was substituted off in the second half as the team faded. Denmark leveled in the 34th when Morten Hjulmand fired in a powerful low shot from long distance, after Kane gave away the ball in defense. Eight years with Southgate has earned England sustained tournament success. The Three Lions reached the final of Euro 2020 — after beating Denmark in the last four — and a semifinal and a quarterfinal at the past two World Cups. “We’re in the environment of winning on the biggest stage,” the coach acknowledged, adding “you have to accept what (criticism) comes our way.” England has never won back-to-back games to begin a Euros and a pattern of second-game syndrome has repeated at three straight tournaments. Opening wins in the past three years have been following by tepid 0-0 draws with Scotland and the United States, now a 1-1 with the Danes who deserved more. “I can’t say we are disappointed but it’s a shame,” Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand said. “There is a result we could have gotten.” Still, England started Euro 2024 by beating Serbia 1-0 and now sits top of Group C with four points. That tally always has been enough to advance in the 24-team Euros format where four third-place teams from the six groups go forward to the round of 16. England can finish in any position from first to third in the Group C standings after playing unbeaten Slovenia next Tuesday. Slovenia drew 1-1 with Serbia earlier Thursday, four days after getting the same result against Denmark. Serbia meets Denmark in their final games also on Tuesday evening. Southgate had defended his players from what seemed like unfair criticism for the nervy nature of the win against Serbia, ceding some control after Jude Bellingham’s early goal. Bellingham was subdued Thursday and Southgate removed the stellar strike trio of Kane, Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka in one sweep in the 69th. Jarrod Bowen, Eberechi Eze, Ollie Watkins came on and within two minutes Watkins almost scored with a shot after a darting run. The coach’s patience seemed to run out in the 85th when his players repeatedly gave away the ball and surrendered scoring chances. He gestured from the sideline with both index fingers pointing to his temples, urging them to think more. England had led by seizing on sleepiness in the Denmark defense. Hesitation by Victor Kristiansen let right-back Kyle Walker surge past him to steal the ball for a pass across the goalmouth. When the ball reached Kane he poked home a left-footed shot for a record extending 64th England goal for the captain. Kane had his part in Denmark’s leveler. His unwise pass out of defense soon went to Hjulmand, who strode forward to fire a low shot past goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and in the net off his right-hand post. The game was played beneath a closed stadium roof on slippery turf that cut up after steady rain this week. The teams had royal watchers from the stands with the king of Denmark, Frederik X, and future king of England, Prince William, at the game. An England team packed with aristocrats of club soccer and stars of the Champions League looked more common on Thursday. “To achieve extraordinary things you have got to go through some difficult moments,” said Southgate, whose team typically sticks around for the final week. “Today was a difficult moment without a doubt.” Serbia 1, Slovenia 1 A late strike denied Slovenia a first-ever win in a European Championship as Serbia snatched a draw Thursday. Zan Karnicnik’s 69th-minute goal put Slovenia on the brink of a historic win until substitute Luka Jovic leveled deep in stoppage time to keep Serbia’s chances of advancing to the knockout stage alive. The goal sent the Serbia fans into raucous joy but also saw them throw flares and other objects onto the field. By that point, the ground around both goals was littered with plastic cups that had rained down from the stands in the final 10 minutes, prompting announcements over the stadium’s speakers urging the fans to stop. The equalizer was virtually the last action as the referee blew fulltime immediately after the players restarted. The Slovenia players collapsed to the ground in disappointment. “Serbs do not die so easily,” Serbia coach Dragan Stojkovic said. “We do not give up and nor will we. We believe all the way to the end and the reward came for believing. “We didn’t accept that we would lose to Slovenia tonight, we didn’t want to accept this result and that’s why the reward came.” It would have been Slovenia’s second win in a major tournament and its first since victory over Algeria in the 2010 World Cup. “Slovenia has shown that it has a place here at the European Championships,” Slovenia coach Matjaz Kek said. “Sports and football can be cruel but I believe karma will play its part for this team. We have played a fair game in an atmosphere for the ages. “We have felt disappointment because we know how strong the Serbia players are, how good they are at dead-ball situations. There was a lack of concentration in the last minute but a big thank you to the players for the heart that they have shown in this arena.” Slovenia — which drew against Denmark in their opener — plays England in its final group match on Tuesday, when Serbia faces Denmark. Serbia lost to England in its first match and could have found itself eliminated with a loss in Munich. Serbia soccer officials threatened to quit the competition even before a ball had been kicked becasue of offensive fan chants reportedly heard during the Albania-Croatia match. “I’m just focusing on the game,” Stojkovic said when asked about it. “Honestly speaking, I didn’t even read anything. Believe me or not, it’s true.” With both teams needing a win on Thursday to boost their chances of progressing, the match started at a fast pace and Serbia goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic had to make two early saves. Those two shots on target in the first eight minutes were as many as Slovenia had in total in its draw with Denmark. The best chance of the half fell to Slovenia in somewhat fortunate circumstances. Timi Elsnik tried to pass to a teammate but the ball came off a Serbia defender and fell kindly back to him for a thunderous effort which crashed off the right post. Benjamin Sesko fired the rebound woefully over. Slovenia eventually broke the deadlock with a move started and finished by Karnicnik. The defender won the ball deep inside his own half and ran some 40 yards before picking out Elsnik on the left and racing into the box to collect the cross and tap home at the back post. Serbia almost leveled immediately but Aleksandar Mitrovic — who scored in his previous two matches against Slovenia — hit the crossbar. Serbia threw everything at Slovenia in the final stages. Even Rajkovic came up for the final corner but it was Jovic who leapt highest to head it past Oblak in the fifth minute of added time. “I love him very much” Stojkovic said.",

Thursday night, Kevin Costner put an end to speculation about his future with the Paramount mega-hit, announcing in a video posted to his Instagram account that he won’t be returning to “Yellowstone” for the final half of Season 5. The news comes hours after Paramount announced that Season 5 part 2 will premiere in November with or without its top star. Though Costner didn’t mention the behind-the-scenes drama that has rocked the breakaway Paramount Network hit since it went on hiatus in January 2023, the reason for his exist is inextricably tied to it. The actor cited “all the things that’s required” for his new western film, “Horizon” as the reason he won’t be returning to play Dutton family patriarch John Dutton in “season five B or into the future.” “It was something that really changed me,” he said, and suggesting he hopes the “Yellowstone” audience will follow him to see “Horizon,” he added “I’ll see you at the movies.” Representatives for Paramount didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from TheWrap. “I want to reach out and let you know that after this long year and a half of working on ‘Horizon’ and doing all the things that’s required, and thinking about ‘Yellowstone,’ that beloved series that I love, that I know you love, I just realized that I’m not going to be able to continue season five B or into the future,” he said. “It was something that really changed me. I loved it. And I know you loved it. And I just wanted to let you know that I won’t be returning and I love the relationship we’ve been able to develop and I’ll see you at the movies,” Costner said.

                    "text": "It’s official: Kevin Costner will not be returning to Yellowstone. The actor posted a video to social media on Thursday in which he confirmed long-mooted speculation that he was done with Paramount+’s monster neo-Western drama Yellowstone. “I just, want to reach out and let you know that after this long year and a half of working on Horizon and doing all the things that that’s required,” Costner said at the start of the clip, in reference to the Western film series Horizon: An American Saga, the first part of which, Horizon: An American Saga – Chapter One, premiered at this year’s Cannes Film Festival. He added, “Thinking about Yellowstone, that beloved series that I love, that I know you love. I just realized that I’m not going to be able to continue, season five or into the future.” Regarding Yellowstone, Costner said the show “was something that really changed me.” “I loved it and I know you loved it, and I just wanted to let you know that I won’t be returning. I love the relationship we’ve been able to develop, and I’ll see you at the movies.” The second half of season five of Yellowstone will return Nov. 10, although an episode count has yet to be announced. There remained lingering hopes that Costner, who played patriarch John Dutton in the Taylor Sheridan-created show, would return, although it was extremely unlikely he would have featured in season five as those episodes are already filming and Costner has been busy with Horizon. Yet Costner, in recent weeks, has been repeatedly making statements to the press about wanting to rejoin the project — but only if he likes his character’s final arc. “I loved the show,” Costner told People Magazine this week. “I liked the people on the show. I liked what it was about. I love that world … I’ve always felt that … It might be an interesting moment to come back and finish the mythology of this modern-day family. And if that happens, I would step into it if I agreed with how it was being done.” Much of Costner’s creative energies, and his own personal finances, have been tied up with the independently financed Horizon, an expansive and ambitious series of Western film that he will direct, star, co-write and produce. The Oscar-winning filmmaker has mapped out a four movie series, with Chapter One, hitting theaters on June 28. The first Horizon film cost $100 million to make before marketing but was tracking to open to $12 million earlier this month. Horizon is a passion project for Costner, who put $38 million of his own wealth into the project to pursue his own vision of the West. A large chunk of the budget was financed through foreign sales, whereby rights are sold off territory by territory. Chapter Two follows quickly, and is set to open in theaters on Aug. 16 this year. The third and fourth chapters are currently undated, but Costner revealed to The Hollywood Reporter that he has filmed some of Chapter 3, but needs more funds to complete his vision. “I don’t want to let this pile of things I have — whether it’s money, whether it’s [possessions] — be so important to me that I can’t think about what I want to do,” Costner told THR‘s Scott Feinberg at Cannes, explaining why he put his own money into the movie. “I’m going to keep enough things that my family’s going to be good. … I’d like to have money, I’d like to have nice things, but I thought to myself, ‘That’s going to control me if I let it.’”",

                    "text": "Kevin Costner always seemed to leave the door open for more Yellowstone after his surprise exit from the series, but not anymore. The actor, who's going all in a series of Western movies starting with Horizon: An American Saga, released a video on Thursday that definitively states he won't be coming back. “I just want to reach out and let you know that after this long year and a half of working on Horizon and doing all the things that that’s required, and thinking about Yellowstone, that beloved series that I love, that I know you love, I just realized that I’m not going to be able to continue, season 5B or into the future,\" Costner said in the video, sporting sunglasses and a cap. \"It was something that really changed me,\" he continued. \"I loved it and I know you loved it. And I just wanted to let you know that I won't be returning. I love the relationship that we've been able to develop, and I'll see you at the movies.\" Costner's comments are the first confirmation that his performance as lead character John Dutton will not appear in the remaining episodes. Though he's now also ruling out any involvement in future spinoffs. This comes shortly after Paramount Network announced this week that the final episodes of Yellowstone season 5 will finally arrive beginning Sunday, Nov. 10 at 8 p.m. ET/PT. Filming is still underway in Montana. Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more. It will be almost two years since fans enjoyed new Yellowstone episodes. Season 5's eighth episode was released in January 2023 with John's children Beth (Kelly Reilly) and Jamie (Wes Bentley) declaring war on each other. Series creator Taylor Sheridan denied rumors of any strife between him and Costner, and accredited his lead actor's departure from the show to his involvement in the Horizon films. Costner recently appeared on the Today show, where he spoke about his leave. \"I did it for five years, and I wanted to work more than once a year,\" he said. \"We lost an entire year at one point, and I thought, that can't happen again. It was well over a year. I thought I have to be in a position to make the things. Material has to be ready at certain times, and we weren't able to do that. After five years, I thought, I'm not going to do this. If we can get that, we can do that, and I'll do it.\" In the same interview, which was filmed just days before he delivered his new comments on the matter, he noted, \"I’ve supported that thing and I’ve loved it, it’s been really important to me. I would love to go back under the right circumstances. I think that's what all of us want. At this point, for me, it really needs to be the right circumstances.\" Costner has also expressed the possibility of working with Sheridan again. In a separate chat with Entertainment Weekly in May, he mentioned that he and the Yellowstone creator hadn't spoken about the final season's episodes. \"If he sees me in something that he wants to do, I'll look at it just the way I did Yellowstone and maybe we will end up doing something together,\" he said.",

                    "text": "UFC 303 was supposed to signal the return of MMA superstar Conor McGregor, who was slated to take on Michael Chandler. However, weeks before the event was set to kick off on June 29, the fight was canceled.Read more: Conor McGregor Forced Out of UFC 303 With Injury, New Fights AnnouncedMany wondered what occurred that led to McGregor pulling out of a professional fight for the first time in his career. UFC President Dana White took to social media to announce that McGregor suffered an injury, though it was never disclosed what that injury was. McGregor himself has now revealed the gruesome injury, showcasing multiple pictures on his X page.McGregor showcased three images along with a caption that reads, \"Chael shut your pie hole, h**. You tap from ground and pound.\"McGregor is alluding to what UFC fighter and commentator Chael Sonnen said about the situation. Sonnen indicated on his \"Good Guy, Bad Guy Podcast\" that McGregor was not injured and was instead in rehab for alcohol consumption.McGregor was quick to shoot down those rumors by posting images of the injury that led to his having to pull out of UFC 303. From the above images, the Irish superstar appears to have a very badly broken toe, which would severely impact his ability to stand or move comfortably, along with making crucial kicks.McGregor's foot also appears to be swollen, which would also impact his ability to make strategic moves when evading or going in for strikes. UFC doctors were likely called and told to evaluate the injury, despite McGregor potentially wanting to fight regardless of having a broken toe.As stated, McGregor has never pulled out of a professional fight, so the injury must have been significant enough that he was told not to fight Chandler.The good news is that reports have indicated that McGregor will still return to the octagon at some point, and that could be sometime at the end of summer or the beginning of fall.The current unknown factor here is whether Chandler will still continue to wait to fight McGregor. He has waited for two years without taking on any other opponents. Now, the fight has been delayed once again.Chandler has been active on social media and could be hinting at potentially fighting for the BMF (Baddest Mother F*****) title. At the very least, he is making it known he wishes to fight for that belt, which is currently owned by Max Holloway. Holloway and Chandler would be a good fight, but it's up to White and the UFC to book it.",

The Irish fighter posted on Instagram that he was “super ready” for the June 29 fight in Las Vegas before the injury. “We had a lapse in concentration and engaged in a training session without wearing the full protective gear and I hit the toe off the elbow and broke the toe clean,” he wrote. “It needs a few weeks that’s it. I couldn’t justify to my team, or fans, that I make the walk hindered again. That walk has been seen. This next walk has got to be, and it will be, 100 percent Conor McGregor. The fans deserve it and we are getting close.” McGregor, who turns 36 next month, was preparing for his first fight since July 2021, when the Irish star (22-6) lost for his second straight matchup with Dustin Poirier and broke his leg in a TKO. McGregor last won when he beat Donald Cerrone in January 2020, following a loss to Khabib Nurmagomedov in October 2018. No date has been set for McGregor’s next fight nor is it known whether he will match up against Chandler. The canceled contest was a non-title welterweight fight. McGregor wrote in his Instagram post that he will fight again — and looks to spend his prize money on a fancy European car for starters. “Take the lesson and move forward. I will get this back. I’ve got to I’ve got two fights left on my contract,” he said. “I’ve got Bugattis and more yachts on my mind. I’m coming to shine. I gotta just take my time.”",

U.S. Olympic and Paralympic CEO Sarah Hirshland said Friday that while the U.S. team appreciates efforts aimed at sustainability, the federation would be supplying AC units for what is typically the largest contingent of athletes at the Summer Games. “As you can imagine, this is a period of time in which consistency and predictability is critical for Team USA’s performance,” Hirshland said. “In our conversations with athletes, this was a very high priority and something that the athletes felt was a critical component in their performance capability.” The Washington Post reported earlier this month that Germany, Australia, Italy, Canada and Britain were among the other countries with plans to bring air conditioners to France.

                    "text": "EUGENE, Ore. (AP) — The U.S. Olympic team is one of a handful that will supply air conditioners for their athletes at the Paris Games in a move that undercuts organizers’ plans to cut carbon emissions. U.S. Olympic and Paralympic CEO Sarah Hirshland said Friday that while the U.S. team appreciates efforts aimed at sustainability, the federation would be supplying AC units for what is typically the largest contingent of athletes at the Summer Games. “As you can imagine, this is a period of time in which consistency and predictability is critical for Team USA’s performance,” Hirshland said. “In our conversations with athletes, this was a very high priority and something that the athletes felt was a critical component in their performance capability.” The Washington Post reported earlier this month that Germany, Australia, Italy, Canada and Britain were among the other countries with plans to bring air conditioners to France. Olympic organizers have touted plans to cool rooms in the Athletes Village, which will house more than 15,000 Olympians and sports officials over the course of the games, using a system of cooling pipes underneath the floors. The average high in Paris on Aug. 1 is 26 degrees Celsius (79 degrees Fahrenheit). The objective is to keep the rooms between 23-26 degrees (73-79 degrees Fahrenheit). The rooms will also be equipped with fans. “I want the Paris Games to be exemplary from an environmental point of view,” Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo has said about the plans for the Olympics. According to the International Energy Agency, fewer than 1 in 10 households in Europe has air conditioning, and the numbers in Paris are lower than that. The study said that of the 1.6 billion AC units in use across the globe in 2016, more than half were in China (570 million) and the United States (375 million). The entire European Union had around 100 million. The Olympics mark the most important stop on the athletic careers of the 10,500-plus athletes who will descend on Paris, which has led some high-profile countries to undercut environmental efforts for the sake of comfort. “It’s a high-performance environment,” Australian Olympic Committee spokesman Strath Gordon explained to The Post. ___ AP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games",

The back of the memorial, which previously was left blank for people to sign with messages of respect, was graffitied earlier this month, a community organizer from a group that helps preserve it told Military Times. “As a military person driving through there, Vanessa is their battle buddy,” AnaLuisa Carrillo-Tapia, from the civil rights group League of United Latin American Citizens, LULAC, said. “What she went through, helped bring a lot of change and a lot of change that should have been approved a long time ago.” This was not the first time the memorial was damaged, but now advocates are rallying behind an effort to turn the faded, unused space on the back into a mural for a sailor whose death also helped lead to systemic shifts in the armed forces, as a reminder to troops that resources exist to aid them in their various struggles. Navy Petty Officer 3rd Class Brandon Caserta, who died by suicide in 2018, serves as the namesake of a law implemented last year that streamlines the process for service members across the armed forces to request mental health care services, or to seek confidential assistance for other reasons.

In addition to paying for equipment and artist fees, the kickstart project plans to use revenue earned in the campaign to purchase additional lighting to deter vandalism. As of Friday morning, the GoFundMe had raised a few hundred dollars toward its $10,000 goal. Caserta’s parents shared that any extra funds raised would go toward future murals that they are looking to help sprout up across the country in areas with a high concentration of military personnel. The goal is to paint the mural by June 25, the anniversary of Brandon’s death by suicide, Carrillo-Tapia said, but that one way or another it would happen. “We see an opportunity to carry on the message,” she said. “You matter to us, we want to make sure that you’re taken care of.”",

                    "title": "Only Clarence Thomas Would Let Domestic Abusers Keep Their Guns In New Ruling",
                    "text": "The Supreme Court ruled Friday that individuals who pose a “credible threat to the physical safety of another” may be stripped of their guns, showing that even its extremely expansive reading of the Second Amendment stops short of letting a proven domestic abuser carry arms. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority, joined by every justice except — shockingly — Justice Clarence Thomas. Justice Sonia Sotomayor also wrote a concurrence, joined by Justice Elena Kagan. Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson all wrote separate concurring decisions. Roberts put some, if very modest, guardrails on the Bruen decision from last term, when Thomas, writing for the majority, knocked down a century-old New York gun licensing law because it lacked a historical analogue from the country’s founding. Taking that logic to its natural conclusion, Zackey Rahimi argued that there was certainly no founding-era analogue to stripping domestic abusers like him of their firearms — an obvious truth in a time when the most powerful and wealthy white women were considered far less than full citizens. “The Second Amendment permits more than just regulations identical to those existing in 1791,” Roberts wrote, saying that “the Court’s conclusion in Bruen that regulations like the surety laws are not a proper historical analogue for a broad gun licensing regime does not mean that they cannot be an appropriate analogue for a narrow one.” “Holding otherwise would be as mistaken as applying the protections of the right only to muskets and sabers,” he added. The ruling was yet another smack on the wrist for the Fifth Circuit, as Roberts took pains to explain the twofold way the circuit court had erred. The Supreme Court reversing the Fifth Circuit has been a theme this term — less a sign of the high court’s moderation, and more of the Fifth’s right-wing extremity. “For its part, the Fifth Circuit made two errors. First, like the dissent, it read Bruen to require a ‘historical twin’ rather than a ‘historical analogue,’” Roberts wrote. “Second, it did not correctly apply our precedents governing facial challenges.” In his lone dissent, Thomas chastises the rest of the Court, including the conservatives who joined him in Bruen: They all read his decision wrong, he wrote, which does require something closer to a historical twin than a cousin in upholding gun regulations. He spent pages railing against the government’s interpretation that all unfit or dangerous people should be stripped of their guns, equating it to a tyrannical stomping on a sanctified right. “While Congress cannot revive disarmament laws based on race, one can easily imagine a world where political minorities or those with disfavored cultural views are deemed the next ‘dangers’ to society,” he wrote, clearly imagining, with a shudder, his MAGA allies being disarmed. Sotomayor, joined by Kagan, wrote to both cheer the Chief’s looser approach to Bruen and to make explicit that Thomas’ approach to gun regulations would moot nearly all of them if they lack a beat-for-beat founding-era predecessor. She also made a concise liberal argument against originalism: How can our interpretation of the Constitution and statutory regimes be guided by a philosophy grounded in a time when only certain white men were entitled to their protections? “History has a role to play in Second Amendment analysis, but a rigid adherence to history, (particularly history predating the inclusion of women and people of color as full members of the polity), impoverishes constitutional interpretation and hamstrings our democracy,” Sotomayor argued. Barrett more anxiously seconds the majority’s wider approach to historical analogues, though added that “harder level-of-generality problems can await another day.” Gorsuch wrote essentially a rebuttal to Sotomayor and Kagan, a glowing endorsement of originalism as the gold standard in constitutional interpretation: “Faithful adherence to the Constitution’s original meaning may be an imperfect guide, but I can think of no more perfect one for us to follow,” he simpered. Kavanaugh joined in in his own concurrence, waxing that “the Constitution is a document of majestic specificity with ‘strikingly clean prose.’” Gorsuch also emphasized the narrowness of the decision, leaving the door open to future rulings on whether the government can disarm someone without a judicial finding that he poses a credible threat, whether someone can be disarmed permanently or whether someone can be punished for using his gun in self defense (this last, he claims ominously, has historical roots indicating that even someone shown to be a credible threat can use his guns for self defense). This Court, he made clear, is not giving up its radicalism on gun rights just because this case made the justices squeamish. Buried in Kavanaugh’s pages-long ode to originalism — peppered with sucking up to various conservative justices, including Roberts — is a worrying contention that heightened scrutiny is a fairly recent invention that doesn’t hold much weight and should not be expanded. Strict scrutiny, the highest of these, is often invoked in equal protection claims, and meant to guard against laws that infringe on fundamental rights, or that involve classifications like race or national origin. Jackson wrote to criticize all of the Court’s recent Second Amendment decisions, and to point out that forcing lower courts — who lack expertise and time — to cobble together historical analogues has proven unworkable and chaotic. “The message that lower courts are sending now in Second Amendment cases could not be clearer,” she wrote. “They say there is little method to Bruen’s madness.” She added that legislatures deserve to know whether their gun regulations will pass constitutional muster, and to be able to depend on consistent rulings that point the way.

Prior to this latest billionaire boondoggle, Mellon donated $5 million to RFK Jr.’s campaign in April, according to The New York Times.

                    "text": "New video footage appears to capture the first combat employment of Russia's 6,600-pound glide bomb in Ukraine, a highly destructive capability that analysts say could be a tremendous problem for Kyiv.Russian sources published footage to the Telegram messaging app purportedly showing a FAB-3000 M-54 bomb strike Ukrainian positions in the northeastern Kharkiv region on Thursday.The munition was outfitted with a unified planning and correction module that turns it into a glide bomb, meaning it could have been air-launched from far away. Upon impact, the bomb causes a massive fireball. With a large blast radius, the explosion rips through just about everything in its path — though it's mostly rubble from previous fighting.One Russian milblogger, Fighterbomber, noted that the strike actually missed its target by a few meters, but the devastating blast radius makes up for any inaccuracies. Fragments from the explosion can travel more than 4,000 feet out, the channel suggested.Reportedly the first video of a Russian FAB-3000 UMPK glide bomb strike. https://t.co/C1NY8OXWMG https://t.co/VilUVEYlmJ pic.twitter.com/ob32zsPLL9In March, Russia's defense ministry announced increased production of the FAB-3000 — and several other munitions, like the 1,100-pound FAB-500 and 3,300-pound FAB-1500. All three of these can be modified and turned into glide bombs, but it was unclear whether the heaviest one would be an issue for aircraft to carry.Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War think tank said the use of the FAB-3000 bomb awards Russia a new weapon that carries a \"high potential for destruction\" if it can be launched with impunity.\"The fact that Russian forces have figured out how to launch FAB-3000s is a significant development and will increase the destructive potential of Russia's ongoing glide bomb attacks against Ukrainian forces and infrastructure,\" the analysts wrote in a Thursday assessment.\"Russian forces have already increased guided and unguided glide bomb use against Ukraine, particularly in Kharkiv Oblast, to devastating effect,\" they said.\"Should Russian forces be able to launch massive barrages of FAB-3000s (or even heavier guided glide bombs), they will be able to cause even more widespread damage to Ukrainian frontline positions and critical infrastructure,\" the analysts added.Russia's glide-bomb strikes have caused headaches for Ukraine throughout the war, but these munitions have been especially problematic over the past few months. Unlike conventional gravity bombs, glide bombs have flight control surfaces and are standoff weapons. Attacking aircraft can release them at a distance — in many cases, well beyond the reach of Ukraine's air-defense systems.Because these munitions have short flight times, small radar signatures, and non-ballistic trajectories, they are extremely difficult to intercept. The only way to really defeat them is by either intercepting the aircraft mid-flight or destroying it at its base.With the Kharkiv region bearing the brunt of Moscow's glide-bomb strikes in recent months, Ukrainian officials called for Western countries to relax restrictions on Kyiv using their weapons to strike inside Russian territory so that the country could better tackle this deadly and destructive threat. Some of those restrictions have since been lifted.",

                    "text": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito missed his second day of work in a row on Friday, June 21, as his colleagues handed down several opinions that included a landmark Second Amendment ruling. He has now missed the release of nine court opinions between the two days, and the Supreme Court has not offered an explanation for his unexpected absences. The final weeks of June are usually the busiest for Supreme Court justices, and this year is no exception — more than a dozen cases remain undecided with only a week left in the term. The court will have to extend its term into July if any opinions are outstanding by the end of the month, putting justices into overdrive to catch up on their caseload. Alito, who authored the 2022 opinion that overturned Roe v. Wade, is often ranked the most conservative justice on the Supreme Court. At 74 years old, he's also the second-oldest, behind Clarence Thomas. He has been under scrutiny since The New York Times reported in May that his personal properties flew flags associated with the pro-Trump \"Stop the Steal\" movement and used by Jan. 6 Capitol rioters. Alito, who said that his wife chose to fly the flags, refused to recuse himself from two soon-to-be-decided Supreme Court cases related to Jan. 6 criminal charges.

Argentina is seeking its third straight major title after winning the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 World Cup and they got things underway at a sold out Mercedes-Benz Stadium. With South America's championship moved to the United States for the second time, Messi set a Copa América record by playing in his 35th match, one more than Chile's Sergio Livingstone from 1941-53. Messi extended his own record with his 18th assist. Messi, who turns 37 on Monday, created the first goal when he headed a pass through the defense for Alexis MacAllister. The midfielder side-footed to Álvarez while crashing into onrushing goalkeeper Maxime Crépeau about 8 yards out. Álvarez had a virtually empty net and kicked the ball in over a sliding defender for his eighth goal in 32 international appearances. Messi extended his Copa América record when he ran through the center of the midfield and rolled a pass to Martínez, who got his 25th international goal. Messi's best scoring chance was in the 65th minute, when Crépeau made a diving stop and Messi's attempt off the rebound was blocked by the head of defender Derek Cornelius. Messi put a chip wide after he came in alone on Crépeau in the 79th. The Inter Miami star was shaken up by a sliding tackle from defender Moïse Bombito in the 82nd minute, but remained in the game. Argentina plays Chile on Tuesday at East Rutherford, New Jersey, then closes the first round against Peru on June 29 at Miami Gardens, Florida. Canada faces Peru on Tuesday at Kansas City, Kansas, and finishes the group stage against Chile on June 29 at Orlando, Florida. Fourteen U.S. stadiums are hosting the tournament, which runs through June 14 and ends at Miami Gardens, Florida. Six nations from Concacaf were added to the 10 South American teams, just as in the centennial Copa America in 2016. Slow starts did not prevent the Albiceleste from winning their previous two tournaments. Argentina opened the 2022 World Cup with a 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia and began the 2021 Copa America with a 1-1 draw against Chile. Canada made its Copa América debut and played its first competitive match under American coach Jesse Marsch, who was hired on May 13. The former Leeds and New York Red Bulls coach said his side did its best against Messi, but couldn't stop contain him the whole night. \"Yeah, we talked a lot about our compactness and then identifying the spaces that Messi likes to show up,\" Messi said. \"We talked about not diving in because it's hard to win tackles from him and what happens is if you eliminate yourself or if you start diving in for tackles, he's really good slipping and moving and getting back again and making little final plays. \"This is what I say about Messi. I've coached against him several times and I feel like we've had a good match plan and we've executed a lot of good things. He's so good, he's that good that he still makes plays. The two balls he makes on the two goals I think are world class. Amazing, it's awful. It's amazing.\" Grass was installed at Mercedes-Benz Stadium after a MLS game Saturday on the usual artificial turf. Argentina started eight players who began the 2022 World Cup final victory over France, inserting central defender Lisandro Martínez, left back Marcos Acuña and Leandro Paredes for Nicolás Otamendi, Nicolás Tagliafico and Enzo Fernández. Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez was tested in the 43rd minute, but he used his left hand to bat away a bounced header by Stephen Eustáquio. MORE",

Trailing at half-time to an early goal scored by Ivan Schranz, Ukraine's hopes were hanging by a thread but they produced a storming comeback in front of their joyous fans. Slovakia, who shocked Belgium in their opening match, would have ensured a place in the round of 16 with a win, but after a dream start, they paid the price for sitting back. Mykola Shaparenko equalised in the 54th minute with a close-range finish before Ukraine snatched a vital win as Yaremchuk controlled a lofted pass by Shaparenko to prod past Slovakia goalkeeper Martin Dúbravka. Victory lifted Ukraine level on three points with Slovakia and Romania, who face Belgium on Saturday. Just as they did at Euro 2020, Slovakia had won their opening match in impressive fashion, this time by stunning Belgium. Three years ago, however, they still ended up crashing out at the group stage. They began against Ukraine clearly determined to avoid a repeat and dominated the opening exchanges on a Düsseldorf pitch greased up by pre-match rain. Ukraine goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin, one of five changes to the Ukraine team beaten 3-0 by Romania, kept his side level with saves in quick succession to keep out a Lukás Haraslín shot and Schranz's close-range effort. Slovakia were rewarded for their positive start in the 17th minute when Haraslin's measured lobbed cross was headed in at the far post by Schranz for his second goal of the tournament, having also scored winner against Belgium. With their tournament hopes looking as gloomy as the Düsseldorf sky, Ukraine finally sprang to life. Mykhailo Mudryk blasted one shot high over the bar and had a better effort blocked by Slovakia defender Peter Pekarík before right back Oleksandr Tymchyk thumped a skidding low drive against the post with keeper Dubravka beaten. Dubravka then had to be alert to beat out a free kick by Oleksandr Zinchenko, although at the other end, Slovakia threatened to double their lead on the counterattack with Haraslin's shot well saved by Trubin. Ukraine began the second half on the front foot, and Artem Dovbyk, top scorer in La Liga last season, was just unable to direct a Mudryk cross at goal. Kicking toward their yellow-and-blue-clad fans, Ukraine's mounting pressure paid off a minute later when an unmarked Shaparenko was picked out by Zinchenko's silky pass, and he calmly sent a left-footed shot into the corner. Slovakia looked content to hang on for a point but were fortunate when Mudryk struck the post with a shot from an acute angle with 15 minutes left. Ukraine then dug deep, and Yaremchuk was picked out by the excellent Shaparenko to send the war-torn nation into their final group game full of hope.",

Armenia’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it joined United Nations resolutions calling for an immediate ceasefire, and said “the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and the ongoing military conflict” was one of the most important on the international agenda. “We support the ‘two-state’ solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” the statement said. “We are convinced that this is the only way to ensure that both Palestinians and Israelis can fulfill their legitimate aspirations.\" Dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, though none of the major Western powers has done so. Palestinians believe the recognitions confer international legitimacy on their struggle, especially amid international outrage over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Last month, Spain, Ireland and Norway said they had decided to recognize a Palestinian state, and since then Slovenia and the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda have followed suit. DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian Civil Defense authorities say an Israeli airstrike on Gaza City hit a municipal garage, killing five people. The strike on the garage in the center of Gaza City came Friday and killed four municipal workers and one passer-by, while leaving an unknown number of others buried under the rubble of the damaged building, the Civil Defense said. The Gaza municipality confirmed that the strike hit its employees but did not give a breakdown on the casualties. Israel launched the war after Hamas’ surprise Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250. Since then, the Gaza Strip’s infrastructure has suffered heavy damage, and the war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians who are facing widespread hunger. Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 37,400 people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. JERUSALEM — A breakdown in law and order in southern Gaza has made a new route to deliver aid unusable, according to the United Nations and international humanitarian organizations, just days after Israel declared the safe corridor. With thousands of truckloads of aid piled up, groups of armed men are regularly blocking convoys, holding drivers at gunpoint and rifling through their cargo, according to a U.N. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media on the issue. The lawlessness is a major obstacle to aid distribution for southern and central Gaza. In those areas, an estimated 1.3 million Palestinians displaced from Rafah — more than half of Gaza’s entire population — are now sheltering in tent camps and cramped apartments without adequate food, water, or medical supplies. Israel announced Sunday it would observe daily pauses in combat along a route stretching from Kerem Shalom, the strip’s only operational aid crossing in the south, to the nearby city of Khan Younis. The head of the U.N.’s World Food Program said Thursday that the pause has made “no difference at all” in aid distribution efforts. “We haven’t been able to get in,” said Cindy McCain in an interview with Al-Monitor. “We’ve had to reroute some of our trucks. They’ve been looted. As you know, we’ve been shot at and we’ve been rocketed.” The Israeli military body in charge of coordinating humanitarian aid efforts, COGAT, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The U.N. official familiar with the aid effort said that there's been no sign of Israeli activity along the route. The U.N. tried to send a convoy of 60 trucks down the road Tuesday to pick up aid at Kerem Shalom. But 35 of the trucks were intercepted by armed men, the official said. In recent days, the groups have moved closer to the crossing and set up roadblocks to halt trucks loaded with supplies, the U.N. official said. They have searched the pallets for smuggled cigarettes, a rare luxury in a territory where a single smoke can go for $25. The U.N. official said that 25 trucks of flour used the route Tuesday. Some private commercial trucks also got through — many of which used armed security to deter groups seeking to seize their cargo. An AP reporter stationed along the road Monday saw at least eight trucks pass by, armed security guards riding on top. ___ AP writer Julia Frankel contributed.",

Armenia said the so-called \"two-state solution,\" which is backed by other nations including the United States, is the best option to bring peace to the region. \"We are convinced that this is the only way to ensure that both Palestinians and Israelis can fulfill their legitimate aspirations,\" the ministry said. Armenia added it has called for a settlement to the Isareli-Hamas conflict, saying that it \"rejects the targeting of civilian infrastructure, violence against the civilian population and hostage-taking of civilians during armed conflict.\" The Palestinian Authority praised Armenia's decision. \"This recognition contributes positively to preserve the two-state solution, which faces systemic challenges, and promotes security, peace, and stability for all parties involved,\" the Palestinian presidency office in Ramallah said. The announcement stirred anger in Israel with the country summoning the Armenian ambassador for a \"harsh reprimand conversation.\" Armenia's actions come in the footsteps of a United Nations panel that earlier this month called for all countries to recognize Palestine as a state. The panel said it would give the Palestinian people the \"political and diplomatic leverage\" to bring a cease-fire to the current conflict.",

                    "text": "Donald Sutherland was and always will be a legend in the film business. Known for his roles in M*A*S*H, Animal House, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, JFK and, of course, the Hunger Games franchise, the late 88-year-old actor etched his name into Hollywood history. After news of his death broke on June 20, 2024, celebrities promptly reacted, with many of his former co-stars, peers and even exes paying tribute to Donald. Read the emotional tributes from celebrities below. Kiefer Sutherland View this post on Instagram Kiefer was the one who confirmed his late father’s death in a heartbreaking announcement. “With a heavy heart, I tell you that my father, Donald Sutherland, has passed away,” the Designated Survivor alum wrote via Instagram alongside a childhood photo of him and Donald. “I personally think one of the most important actors in the history of film. Never daunted by a role, good, bad or ugly. He loved what he did and did what he loved, and one can never ask for more than that. A life well lived.” Jeremy Renner In response to Kiefer’s Instagram post, Jeremy commented, “Will always love Donald.” Jane Fonda Jane previously worked with Donald in their movie, Klute, and the co-stars briefly dated after meeting on the set of the 1971 film. Jane took to Instagram to share how “heartbroken” she was over the news of his death. “I am stunned to hear that Donald Sutherland has died,” the actress wrote. “He was my fascinating co-star in Klute and we loved working together. In this photo, we are on the Klute set with director Alan Pakula. Donald was a brilliant actor and a complex man who shared quite a few adventures with me, such as the FTA Show, an anti-Vietnam war tour that performed for 60,000 active duty soldiers, sailors, and marines in Hawaii, Okinawa, the Philippines, and Japan in 1971.

                    "text": "Former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick and his girlfriend, 24-year-old Jordon Hudson, have been dating for over a year, PEOPLE can confirm. Belichick, 72, and Hudson, a former cheerleader at Bridgewater State University, have been spotted together on various occasions, igniting rumors of a romance between the ex-NFL coach and Hudson. TMZ was first to report the news of Belichick and Hudson's romance. Belichick's former players, Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski, both made jokes about their coach's younger girlfriend during Netflix's live special, The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady. Gronkowski quipped, “Coach, you used to talk about Foxborough High School when we sucked,” Gronkowski said. “But now I know why you were so obsessed with Foxborough High School: you were scouting your new girlfriend.” Brady later joined in on the jokes, adding: \"When somebody asked me which ring was my favorite, I used to say, ‘The next one,' ” he said. “Now that I’m retired, my favorite is that Ring camera that caught Coach Belichick slinking out of that poor girl’s house at 6 a.m. a few months ago.\" \"You still got it! Respect,\" Brady added. In September 2023, a source told PEOPLE that Belichick and his longtime girlfriend Linda Holliday had called it quits after 16 years together. The insider said that the problem in the former couple's relationship that ultimately led to their split was \"not new\" and they had been \"pretty separate for a while.\" Holliday had dated Belichick since 2007 and served as the president of his Bill Belichick Foundation. “They have issues to clear up that come from a long relationship as well as her role in his professional life,” the source said at the time. At the time, Belichick was busy and \"all about football,\" the source said, adding, \"He doesn't want a lot of public attention on this.\" \"He has a lot on his plate, a good family, and he meets people all of the time,\" the insider added in September. In January, Belichick and the Patriots \"mutually parted ways\" after the team had been struggling to win games and Belichick appeared frustrated in media interviews. Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer , from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Owner Robert Kraft had told ESPN that he was “really disappointed” in the Patriots 2023 season just before Belichick ended his tenure with the team. “I had hoped things would be a lot better,” Kraft said after the team concluded a 4-13 season, the worst record in the AFC Conference. When Belichick formally announced his departure, he said, “I’ll always be a Patriot,” during an emotional address. \"I look forward to coming back here,\" Belichick said, adding, “I’ll always have those great memories. I’ll carry those with me the rest of my life.”",

                    "text": "She’s ready to rah rah sis boom bah. Bill Belichick’s 23-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, was spotted back at cheerleading practice in Boston on Thursday, shortly after her romantic date night with the former New England Patriots coach. The fit brunette was seen in photos obtained by TMZ Friday doing a series of stunts with other athletes at East Celebrity Elite Hingham. Hudson – who was photographed wearing a turquoise sports bra, tight white shorts and sneakers – was in the flyer position and lifted up into the sky for the routine. She has a lot of experience in the sport, as she previously competed with Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts and even won a national championship title with the squad in 2021. It’s unclear if Hudson has plans to pursue a professional cheerleading career in the NFL and try out for the Patriots’ cheer squad. However, the former Miss Maine USA contestant has a good networking contact in her beau, Belichick, whom she has reportedly been dating since at least 2022. One of Hudson’s former teammates claimed to TMZ earlier this week that the pageant queen began dating the NFL coach shortly after he quietly split from his girlfriend of 10 years, Linda Holliday. Hudson and Belichick, 72, reportedly met back in 2021, though, when they happened to be on a flight together from Florida to Boston. The sports analyst even signed the then-college student’s textbook at the time, writing, “Jordon, Thanks for giving me a course in logic! Safe travels!” It appears the pair stayed in touch, and once their romance heated up, Belichick even snuck out of Hudson’s house shirtless following a rendezvous last year. Since their relationship has become public, they have unabashedly stepped out together. On Wednesday, the May-December couple flaunted some PDA while out to dinner with pals at the exclusive club The Boarding House in Nantucket, Mass.",

                    "text": "Bill Belichick’s 24-year-old girlfriend, former cheerleader Jordon Hudson, returned to the mat amid the media circus surrounding the newfound relationship. Hudson, a former cheerleader at Bridgewater State University, was performing stunts as a flyer at a practice for East Celebrity Elite Hingham in the Boston area Thursday night. The brunette sported a teal top and Nike shorts with white sneakers during the practice, which reportedly lasted two hours. Belichick, 72, was not seen in the video. The two had been spotted together in Nantucket earlier in the week. TMZ reported that the free agent NFL coach — who mutually parted ways with the Patriots after 24 years and six Super Bowl titles in January — owns property in the Hingham area. Belichick was seen supporting Hudson at a separate cheer event in D.C. in March. The future Hall of Fame coach kept a low profile while he took in the 2024 Coastal At The Capitol cheer and dance event, which took place at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center, as seen in photos obtained by TMZ. Belichick, who was dressed casually in dark jeans and a navy sweater, reportedly declined to take pictures at the event, but was polite to other fans in attendance — and exited the venue after watching at least one of the teams’ routines. The competition took place around the same time Belichick would usually be scouting talent at the NFL Combine in Indianapolis. Belichick made headlines a few weeks later when he was spotted having dinner with an unidentified brunette at Contessa Italian restaurant in Boston, according to a photo obtained by Deuxmoi, a pseudonymous Instagram gossip account. Prior to Hudson, Belichick previously dated Linda Holliday — who is the president of Belichick’s foundation — for 16 years. News of their split broke in September 2023. However, TMZ reported that Belichick and Hudson have been dating for about two years after they first met on a plane ride in 2021. Earlier this week, The Daily Mail reported that Belichick was exiting Hudson’s house when Ring camera footage surfaced on social media in November 2023 showing him shirtless leaving a residence.",

                    "text": "A Chicago homeowner fought off and chased a would-be burglar around his neighborhood with the first weapon he grabbed to defend himself — a frying pan. Jason Williams was returning to his home in the city’s Logan Square neighborhood from work just after 3 p.m. on Thursday when a security app alerted him of the home invasion. “Came in the house, I looked if there was an available weapon… there was a frying pan laying there, so I grabbed the frying pan, and at the same time the burglar came downstairs,” Williams told ABC 7 Chicago. “At this point it was fight or flight, and I would rather do the fighting,” he added. Security cameras captured the home intruder exiting the house before jumping off the front porch as the frying-pan-wielding Williams pursued. The two men run around the front yard before exiting the camera’s view as three distinct bangs can be heard. “Get out of here, I’m gonna kill you,” Williams can be heard yelling as the intruder runs for the front gate. The chase returns to the front yard as the intruder attempts to escape, opening the gate but Williams delivers another mighty attack. Two Chicago police officers walked up to the home just as the suspect fled into the suburb’s streets. The intruder raced across the street before he eventually gave himself up and was detained. Williams took to social media to share his story following the cartoon-style chase, saying he “almost killed” the suspected burglar. “I just caught a f–king burgler in my house. Holy s–t… Almost killed him, Hit him with a frying pan! Got him!!!” the homeowner wrote on X accompanied by a photo of the man sitting in the middle of the street and a picture of the frying pan. “He’s lucky the cops came. I was putting a good beating on him.. he owes me a new (frying) pan!” Williams also snapped a photo of the burglar seemingly holding his head as he was placed into the back of an ambulance as well as the dented pan. The brave homeowner revealed he was “ok” and the suspect was going to “have a headache tomorrow and was taken away by the ambulance.” “This could have had a different ending, and I’m glad it had a good one,” Williams told the outlet. “My wife’s not happy about the decision I made… probably wouldn’t do it again, but it is what it is.” Williams cooked a seafood dinner — in a frying pan — to cap off his eventful afternoon. “My night to cook. Making swordfish basted in butter and garlic with asparagus. Pan fried of course…” he joked in a separate post on X. Williams didn’t cook on the pan he used against the burglar as it was out of commission until he fixed it. Over the last year, Chicago has seen over 3,400 burglaries, an increase from the 3,346 the Windy City saw over the same time frame in 2023, according to Chicago Police data. The police department confirmed to WLS-TV that a suspect was taken into custody but it was unknown if any charges were filed.",

                    "text": "WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department on Friday fleshed out a proposed rule that would restrict and monitor U.S. investments in China for artificial intelligence, computer chips and quantum computing. The proposed rule stems from President Joe Biden’s August 2023 executive order regarding the access that “countries of concern” have to American dollars that fund advanced technologies, which the U.S. government says would enhance their military, intelligence, surveillance and cyber capabilities. The order identified China, Hong Kong and Macau as countries of concern. The Biden administration has sought to stymie the development of technologies by China, the world’s second-largest economy, that could give it a military edge or enable it to dominate emerging sectors such as electric vehicles. In addition to the proposed rule, Democrat Biden has also placed a stiff tariff on Chinese EVs, an issue with political implications as the president and Republican Donald Trump are both trying to show voters who can best stand up to China, a geopolitical rival and major trading partner. The proposed rule outlines the required information that U.S. citizens and permanent residents must provide when engaging in transactions in this area, as well as what would be considered a violation of the restrictions. It specifically would prohibit American investors from funding AI systems in China that could be used for weapons targeting, combat and location tracking, among other military applications, according to a senior Treasury official who previewed the rule for reporters on the condition of anonymity. Treasury is seeking comment on the proposal through August 4, 2024, and after that is expected to issue a final rule. Biden administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have insisted that they have no interest in “decoupling” from China - however, tensions between the two nations have increased in recent years. After the U.S. military in February 2023 shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the Carolina coast after it traversed sensitive military sites across North America, China threatened repercussions. Since then, incidents between the two nations based on national security concerns have regularly occurred. For instance, Biden in May issued an order blocking a Chinese-backed cryptocurrency mining firm from owning land near a Wyoming nuclear missile base, calling its proximity to the base a “national security risk.” __ Associated Press reporter Fatima Hussein contributed to this report.",

The Biden administration has sought to stymie the development of technologies by China, the world’s second-largest economy, that could give it a military edge or enable it to dominate emerging sectors such as electric vehicles. In addition to the proposed rule, Democrat Biden has also placed a stiff tariff on Chinese EVs, an issue with political implications as the president and Republican Donald Trump are both trying to show voters who can best stand up to China, a geopolitical rival and major trading partner. The proposed rule outlines the required information that U.S. citizens and permanent residents must provide when engaging in transactions in this area, as well as what would be considered a violation of the restrictions. It specifically would prohibit American investors from funding AI systems in China that could be used for weapons targeting, combat and location tracking, among other military applications, according to a senior Treasury official who previewed the rule for reporters on the condition of anonymity. J. Philip Ludvigson, a partner at King & Spalding and a former Treasury official for Investment Security, said “companies and investors are now getting a much better look at what will be expected of them” under the new outbound investment program. “These added details are particularly important because the private sector will be shouldering the many due diligence and compliance burdens associated with making new investments,” he said. Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, a nonprofit organization of American firms that do business in China, said his organization “supports the Biden administration’s efforts to protect U.S. national security while also ensuring robust commercial exchange with China for the benefit of American companies, workers and our economy.” Treasury is seeking comment on the proposal through Aug. 4, 2024, and after that is expected to issue a final rule. Biden administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have insisted that they have no interest in “decoupling” from China — however, tensions between the two nations have increased in recent years. After the U.S. military in February 2023 shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon off the Carolina coast after it traversed sensitive military sites across North America, China threatened repercussions. Since then, incidents between the two nations based on national security concerns have regularly occurred. For instance, Biden in May issued an order blocking a Chinese-backed cryptocurrency mining firm from owning land near a Wyoming nuclear missile base, calling its proximity to the base a “national security risk.”",
