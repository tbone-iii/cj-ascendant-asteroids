                    "text": "Robert Downey Jr. is returning to the character that made him a superhero icon — kind of. The actor surprised Marvel’s Hall H panel on Saturday to announce that he’s returning to star in “Avengers 5,” which is titled “Avengers: Doomsday,” playing Doctor Doom. The Russo Brothers, who directed Downey Jr. in “Captain America: Civil War,” “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Avengers: Endgame,” are returning to direct “Avengers: Doomsday” and its direct sequel “Avengers: Secret Wars.” Downey Jr.’s Marvel return comes after he won his first Oscar for his role in Christopher Nolan’s 2023 film “Oppenheimer.” He said goodbye to the Tony Stark character after over a decade of anchoring the MCU in “Avengers: Endgame,” which saw Tony give up his life to save the universe. That Tony is still dead, but the character Downey Jr. is playing in “Doomsday” is a variant — an alternate universe version of Tony Stark who went down a very different path. Downey Jr.’s Marvel return is also essentially the replacement for Jonathan Majors’ Kang, a supervillain teased in the Marvel TV series “Loki” and 2023 film “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” who was being teed up as the next Thanos-like villain for the MCU. He was due to rule over “Avengers 5” under its previous title, “Avengers: The Kang Dynasty,” but Majors was dropped by Marvel after being convicted of domestic assault. The trajectory has clearly been reworked with Doctor Doom now serving as the next Thanos-level threat that will pave the way for “Secret Wars,” a comics storyline that saw pretty much every single Marvel character come together and suffer devastating losses.

At San Diego Comic-Con on Saturday, July 27, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige gave fans a preview of the next few years in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — and revealed that Downey Jr., 59, will portray the villain Victor von Doom / Doctor Doom in the next Avengers movie, titled Avengers: Doomsday. Feige, 51, and Avengers directors Anthony and Joe Russo announced that the Avengers saga will lead toward an adaptation of the popular comic-book run Secret Wars, but not before Downey Jr., re-enters the MCU as one of Marvel's favorite villains instead of reprising his role as Iron Man. “New mask, same task,\" Downey Jr. said as he emerged onto the panel's stage among a group of actors wearing masks and robes. \"What did I tell ya, I like playing complicated characters.\" The Russo brothers stated prior to revealing Downey Jr. that they believe \"there is one very important character required to do Secret Wars justice,\" and teased they would need \"the greatest actor in the world\" to play Doctor Doom. At Comic-Con in 2022, Feige, 51, officially announced forthcoming MCU titles, including a Blade reboot and two more Avengers installments. Collectively referred to as Phase Five and Six, or the Multiverse Saga, they were initially planned to revolve around Jonathan Majors' villainous Kang the Conqueror, with the fifth Avengers movie titled The Kang Dynasty. But following Majors being found guilty of assault and harassment in his misdemeanor trial of December 2023, the studio dropped the 34-year-old Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania star and announced that the next Avengers film would be renamed.

The actor recently shared that he would be open to returning to Marvel. “Happily. It’s too integral a part of my DNA,” he said in an April 2024 interview with Esquire Magazine. “That role chose me.

The Russo brothers made the announcement at Marvel’s San Diego Comic-Con panel on Saturday night, shortly after being announced as the directors of both Doomsday and the follow-up movie, Avengers: Secret Wars. “New mask,” Downey Jr. said. “Same task.” The Oscar-winning Downey Jr. revived his career with his portrayal of Tony Stark in Iron Man and a litany of other Marvel projects. His time as Stark ended in Avengers: Endgame, as the character died in that movie. But a silly thing like a character dying won’t stop Downey. He’s coming back to play one of the richest villains (nay, characters) in all of superhero-dom: Doctor Doom himself. “What can I tell you? I like playing complicated characters,” Downey Jr. said. Reports first emerged in November 2023 that Marvel was considering pivoting their central villain from the Avengers saga, moving from Kang to Doom. This followed the conviction and sentencing of Kang actor Jonathan Majors for domestic abuse and assault. Marvel officially dropped Majors in December 2023. Avengers: Doomsday is slated to arrive in theaters May 1, 2026. Secret Wars is slated for about a year later, on May 7, 2027. At SDCC, Marvel Studios also announced that the new Fantastic Four, long-time rivals of Doom, will be appearing in both Doomsday and Secret Wars as well.

                    "text": "One character has been noticeably absent from the Fantastic Four teases so far: their longtime nemesis, Doctor Doom. But at Marvel's traditional Hall H panel at Comic-Con 2024 on Saturday, sibling directors Joe and Anthony Russo announced that the iconic supervillain is indeed coming to the Marvel Cinematic Universe — and he's going to be played by the franchise's most beloved actor. That's right, newly minted Oscar winner Robert Downey Jr. is returning to Marvel, but not as Iron Man/Tony Stark. This time, he'll be playing Doom — first in the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday and then in Avengers: Secret Wars. Doom is integral to the Secret Wars comic and promises to serve a similar role on the big screen. In Marvel comics, Doctor Doom is often surrounded by replica Doombots, and the announcement was made in a similar fashion. A group of people in Doom costumes took the stage, only for Downey Jr. to reveal himself to massive crowd applause. \"New mask, same task,\" Downey Jr. said on stage while clad in Doctor Doom robes, after taking off his metal mask. \"What can I say, I like playing complicated characters.\" How could this possibly happen? There are some similarities between Stark and Doom in Marvel comics. They both wear metal masks, they're both rich, and they're both scientific geniuses at a level that impresses aliens and gods. But they've also intersected more directly before. Following the events of the 2016 Marvel comic Civil War II, Stark was in a prolonged coma, and Victor Von Doom took on the mantle of Iron Man in his place in the comic series Infamous Iron Man. Now, we'll be seeing something of a reverse, with the actor known for playing Iron Man on screen taking on the mantle of Doctor Doom. Since this is a multiverse story (the Russos explicitly said it's building up to the collision of parallel universes in Secret Wars), it's possible that this is an alternate-universe version of Stark from somewhere out there in the Marvel multiverse. Avengers: Doomsday is now dated for May 2026, and Avengers: Secret Wars is dated for the following year in May 2027 — parallel to the Russos' previous MCU directing efforts, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, coming out a year apart.",

Instead, he'll be taking a new name and wearing a new mask--that of Victor von Doom, one of Marvel's greatest villains. RDJ kicked off the MCU and introduced superheroes to Earth-616 in 2008's Iron Man and ended his run as Tony Stark in 2018's Avengers Endgame. This could be the MCU's coolest moment--or its silliest. Downey revealed his new role on the Hall H stage, coming out in a Dr. Doom mask and tearing it off to reveal his face to a surprised audience. His comment was simple: \"New mask, same task.\" As part of Marvel Studios' San Diego Comic-Con 2024 panel, the studio announced that directing team Joe and Anthony Russo will return to direct a pair of new Avengers films, with Avengers: Doomsday coming in 2026 and Avengers: Secret Wars following a year after. Victor von Doom will act as the primary antagonist for this pair of movies. Downey had said in recent interviews that he would return to the MCU \"happily.\" \"It's too integral a part of my DNA,\" Downey said. \"That role chose me. And look, I always say, never, ever bet against Kevin Feige. It is a losing bet. He's the house. He will always win.\" Victor von Doom is the long-time enemy of Marvel's founding family, the Fantastic Four, so the character's introduction now, just after the upcoming Fantastic Four: The First Steps, makes sense. Details aside from the titles and directors are light; we're very excited and very curious to see how Marvel Studios makes Robert Downey Jr.'s return--as a brand-new character, no less--make sense. Fantastic Four: The First Steps hits theaters in one year on July 25, 2025. Avengers: Doomsday comes a year later in May 2026, followed by Avengers: Secret Wars in May 2027.",

As revealed by Kevin Feige during the Hall H panel, Robert Downey Jr. is returning to the MCU as villain Doctor Doom in Avengers: Doomsday (previously Avengers 5). \"New mask, same task,\" he quipped on stage. It was also revealed that the casts of Fantastic Four (Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach) and Thunderbolts* (Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, David Harbour, Wyatt Russell, and more) would be part of the next two Avengers films Doomsday and Secret Wars. Kevin Feige also confirmed that Joe and Anthony Russo, directors of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, would be returning to direct the two upcoming Avengers movies. That's despite Kevin Feige previously stating that wasn't happening. \"Joe and I truly believed Endgame was the end of the road for us,\" Anthony Russo said. \"In the time since, through a special story, we have come to potentially see a road to take with you all.\" Previously, the Avengers 5 title was Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. However, the title was changed and Kang actor Jonathan Majors was dropped by Marvel Studios after being found guilty of reckless assault in the third degree and harassment last December. Now, all roads lead to Avengers: Doomsday on May 1, 2026, and Avengers: Secret Wars on May 7, 2027. For more, check out the SDCC 2024 schedule and SDCC 2024 Marvel live blog.

                    "text": "SAN DIEGO — Marvel Studios kicked off its return to San Diego Comic-Con with dancing Deadpool variants and a choir for a panel that included news about the next two “Avengers” films and surprise guests, including Harrison Ford. Among the surprises: Robert Downey Jr. would return to Marvel’s films, but not as Iron Man. He’ll play the villain Victor Von Doom, or Doctor Doom, in one of the upcoming “Avengers” movies. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said that due to this weekend’s success of “Deadpool & Wolverine,” the sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe had now topped $30 billion in box-office earnings. In a nod to a scene in the movie, a choir sang Madonna’s “Like a Prayer” before Feige spoke. “Deadpool & Wolverine,” released Thursday, has already broken one record and could shatter more in its opening weekend. Feige used Saturday’s panel to chart the course ahead for the MCU, revealing Ford’s character in the next “Captain America” film and revealing “Avengers: Secret Wars and “Avengers: Doomsday” as the titles of the next two films in the epic superhero team-up series. Feige said all the actors introduced Saturday would appear in the upcoming “Avengers” movies, which will be directed by Joe and Anthony Russo. The brothers guided the “Avengers” franchise through its sprawling storyline capped by “Avengers: Endgame” in 2019. The session comes after Marvel skipped the convention last year due to the Hollywood strikes, which prevented writers and actors from speaking on panels. Feige is being joined by several special guests, including stars of upcoming Marvel titles like “Captain America: Brave New World,” “Thunderbolts(asterisk)” and “The Fantastic Four.” The cast of “Captain America: Brave New Wold” – Tim Blake Nelson, Danny Rameriez, Giancarlo Esposito and Anthony Mackie – joined the stage first and teased details about the upcoming film. Esposito revealed that he will be playing the villain, Seth Voelker, also known as Sidewinder. The cast then stepped aside to share a scene from the movie on the big screen, which revealed that President Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, played by Ford, is hoping to rebuild the Avengers with Mackie’s Sam Wilson. It also showed Ford’s character transform into the Red Hulk. Ford himself joined the panel after fans were treated to clips from the movie and flexed his muscles to the roaring crowd. The cast and director of “Thunderbolts(asterisk)” also surprised fans with a short clip from the movie. Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan and David Harbour (in full costume and speaking in character as the Red Guardian at first) stormed the stage and shared some more details about their characters. The film is slated to be released in May 2025. The final film teased at the panel was “The Fantastic Four,” starring Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach. The movie will begin filming on Tuesday in London, Feige said. He said the film will hit theaters in almost exactly one year in July 2025. Following a video director Matt Shakman created specifically for Comic-Con that featured the cast in full ’60s glory, he and Feige revealed the official title of the film, “The Fantastic Four: First Steps.” Marvel already took over Hall H on Thursday with an electric panel celebrating “Deadpool & Wolverine,” in which the audience was treated to a full screening and surprise guests joining stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman on stage. The mounting enthusiasm for the film at Comic-Con was reflected across the country as the fans rushed to see it in theaters, securing the film as the new record holder for the Thursday preview for an R-rated movie. The comic book film sold an estimated $38.5 million worth of movie tickets from preview screenings Thursday. The “Deadpool & Wolverine” success woke up a sleepy year for Marvel and assuaged worries about its box-office underperformance in late 2023. The superhero factory hit a record low in November with the launch of “The Marvels,” which opened with just $47 million.

Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige announced the news during Marvel’s panel at San Diego Comic-Con on Saturday, as The Hollywood Reporter reports. Feige also revealed that the Russo brothers would direct the next Avengers film. The upcoming films are Avengers: Doomsday, set to arrive in May 2026, and Avengers: Secret Wars, which is expected in May 2027. “If we’re going to bring Doctor Doom to the screen — he is one of the most complex characters, most entertaining characters in all of fiction,” said Joe Russo during the panel. “If we’re going to do this … then we are going to need the greatest actor in the world.” He added: “As proof of the unimaginable possibilities of the Marvel Universe, we give you the one person who could play Victor von Doom…” before Downey joined Feige and the Russo Bros. on stage. Downey starred as the titular character in 2008’s Iron Man and reprised his role as Iron Man, aka Tony Stark, for 10 films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He will now play a villain of the Fantastic Four. “Same mask, new Task,” Downey told the audience at Comic-Con. Two years ago, Feige had announced a new direction for Avengers 5, with plans for Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, which was supposed to star Jonathan Majors as Kang. In December, Majors was convicted of assaulting his ex-girlfriend with a jury finding him guilty of harassment in the second degree and misdemeanor assault in the third degree, and he was dumped from the project minutes after the verdict. The Russo brothers have had a winning run on Marvel films with 2019’s Avengers: Endgame, the second-biggest selling film of all-time, and they also helmed 2014’s Captain America: Winter Soldier, 2016’s Captain America: Civil War, and 2018’s Avenger: Infinity War. Downey has had a big year thus far. His portrayal of United States Secretary of Commerce Lewis Strauss in Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer earned him his first Oscar, winning Best Supporting Actor in March. He also earned an Emmy nomination for his role in HBO’s The Sympathizer.",

Both Doctor Doom and Jonathan Majors, who was officially replaced as the MCU's big bad, trended worldwide after the big announcement. \"RDJ Doom is either the most creatively bankrupt decision ever or it's going to be the coolest sh*t we've ever seen,\" one fan wrote on the Reddit megathread. Fans expressed shock or simply posted-mind-blown emojis on Twitter and elsewhere, while others debated the significance of this reveal. Is this a multiverse Tony Stark? Or someone else entirely? Downey Jr's cryptic quote offered a hint: \"New mask, same task.\" “New mask, same task.” Robert Downey Jr. surprises Hall H to announce his return to the MCU as Doctor Doom. pic.twitter.com/j1SEjzse3p— Marvel Studios (@MarvelStudios) July 28, 2024 \"A Doom variant that has Tony Stark's face. That sh*t is pretty smart if you're gonna do the multiverse,\" another fan mused. \"All of the Avengers will feel morally uncomfortable as their greatest hero is now their greatest enemy. This kind of makes his sinister nature even more scary. Genius move when you think about it.\" Another fan speculated, \"That's interesting. I feel like if it was a Doom variant from another universe that turns out to be Tony Stark they would had kept it a surprise a la no way home. So them putting him since now makes me think he'll actually play Victor Von Doom which would be okay since he is disfigured.\" The dramatic nature of Downey Jr's reveal, in which he strode on to the stage in a green cloak and ripped off his mask. It's a moment that will surely be remembered as one of the most dramatic reveals in recent Marvel history.

More than one fan referred to Downey Jr's casting – and the return of Anthony Russo and Joe Russo as director – as a \"break glass in case of emergency moment.\" \"If they want a clever way to remove Kang from the MCU, I hope they recreate this moment from the original Secret Wars comics of Doom just vaporizing Kang in an instant with a Doom-controlled Ultron,\" a fan quipped.

During the panel, Kevin Feige confirmed that the MCU is the first franchise to cross $30 billion as Deadpool & Wolverine opens in theatres across the world. Now the future of the MCU is set. We'll know soon enough whether Marvel is able to return to the heights of Endgame, or if the Robert Downey Jr casting is yet one more example of a franchise stuck playing the hits.

At San Diego Comic Con's Marvel panel in Hall H on Saturday, the Russo Brothers and Marvel President Kevin Feige revealed Downey Jr. as Victor Von Doom in Avengers: Doomsday, the new name for Avengers 5. The Russos were officially confirmed as the helmers of Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars, which are scheduled to hit theaters in 2026 and 2027, respectively. \"Joe and I have come to potentially see a road forward with the biggest story that Marvel comics ever told,\" Anthony Russo said about Secret Wars. \"It's the first comic book run that I read as a kid that made me fall in love with comics.\" However, to set up \"the magnitude of the filmmaking, the vastness of the storytelling, the world colliding epic-ness of all of this,\" Anthony Russo revealed the \"unimaginable possibilities in the Marvel multi-universe\" and introduced Downey Jr. as the man to take up the villain's iconic mask and cloak.

For over the decade that followed, he played Stark in 10 Marvel titles: Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3, The Incredible Hulk, The Avengers, Captian America: Civil War, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Downey Jr. has gone on the record recently that he'd be open to returning to Marvel in some capacity, but no one had Victor Von Doom in mind. An epic casting announcement, to be sure, it'll be interesting to see how the Russos set up his introduction and inclusion in Marvel's movie canon moving forward. \"New mask, same task,\" Downey Jr. said to a cheering crowd, adding: \"I like playing complicated characters.\" And I think it's safe to speak for everyone when I say, we like watching him do it.",

                    "text": "Robert Downey Jr. is returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Doctor Doom in a new “Avengers” movie titled “Avengers: Doomsday,” which will be directed by Joe and Anthony Russo in their own return to Marvel. The directing duo is on deck to helm two new “Avengers” movie: “Doomsday,” which will introduce Victor von Doom/Doctor Doom, and “Avengers: Secret Wars.” While Downey had said in recent interviews that he was open to returning to Marvel, fans naturally assumed that meant he would come back as Iron Man/Tony Stark. Downey’s return as the villainous Victor von Doom comes as a massive shock to the fandom, including the ecstatic audience at Marvel’s presentation at San Diego Comic-Con. Downey made a victorious appearance to Hall H on Saturday evening to reveal his return. Downey’s very first appearance as the playboy super-genius Stark came in 2008’s “Iron Man,” which was the first installment in the interconnected Marvel Cinematic Universe devised by Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige. Over the next 11 years, Downey would reprise the role in 10 Marvel films, including “Iron Man 2,” “Iron Man 3,” “The Incredible Hulk,” “The Avengers,” “Captian America: Civil War,” “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Avengers: Endgame.” “Endgame” featured the death of Iron Man. Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige stressed to Vanity Fair last December that he had no interest in messing with Downey’s emotional exit. “We are going to keep that moment and not touch that moment again,” Feige said at the time about Iron Man’s death. “We all worked very hard for many years to get to that, and we would never want to magically undo it in any way.” Downey is now returning to Marvel, but not as Iron Man. The actor had been quite open this year about his interest in coming back to the franchise. Speaking to Esquire magazine after his Oscar win for “Oppenheimer,” the actor was asked if he would ever return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe now that he is officially an Academy Award winner. The actor didn’t hesitate to answer yes. “Happily. It’s too integral a part of my DNA,” Downey said. “That role chose me. And look, I always say, ‘Never, ever bet against Kevin Feige.’ It is a losing bet. He’s the house. He will always win.” The Victor von Doom news continues a huge year for the actor. His performance as Lewis Strauss in Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” won him the Academy Award win for best supporting actor in March. Most recently, Downey was featured in the cast of Park Chan-wooks’ mini-series “The Sympathizer” on HBO, where he played CIA operative Claude and several other roles. He earned an Emmy nomination for supporting actor in a limited series or anthology.",

I'm over in the UK, so when I went to bed last night knowing that Marvel's Comic-Con panel was happening, I thought to myself \"how bad could it be?\" It felt obvious that the company was going to pull something big, given that it hasn't been at San Diego Comic-Con's Hall H in a little while, and considering the fact that the MCU has been waning in popularity in recent years. Deadpool & Wolverine might be on track for a great opening, but Ant-Man 3 and The Marvels both struggled at the box office, at least compared to earlier entries in the franchise. So how is Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige plan to fix this? Well to start, he's bringing back Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame directing duo the Russo Brothers to helm the next couple of Avengers films. Avengers 5 even has a brand new name, because yes, Marvel is no longer going down the Kang route after accusations of assault and harassment were placed upon Jonathon Majors, accusations he was later found guilty for. Now, Avengers 5 will be called Avengers: Doomsday. Yes, that is because Doctor Doom will be the big bad, as previous reports indicated - and he'll be the big bad through to the following Avengers film, Secret Wars, too. Here comes the second thing Feige is doing to get people back on board with the MCU - he's brought back Iron Man/ Tony Stark actor Robert Downey Jr. to play Doctor Doom. I don't know about you, but this feels ridiculously gimmicky. Aside from being a bit of a creatively cowardly decision, there's also the issue that many fans wanted Doom to be portrayed by a Romani actor, as that is the character's heritage, a heritage very important to his story. It's obvious that this is going to be some kind of multiverse play, that's Marvel's whole thing at the minute, so maybe this is something of a red herring, but it still feels like quite a groan worthy decision. Avengers: Doomsday is currently slated to be released May 2026, with Secret Wars due out the following May in 2027.",

                    "text": "Avengers fans — assemble because Robert Downey Jr. is coming back to the Marvel Cinematic Universe! The 59-year-old actor, who played Iron Man in the MCU, surprised fans in Hall H on Saturday, July 27, at San Diego Comic Con by unmasking himself as villain Victor Von Doom in the upcoming film Avengers: Doomsday. Filmmaker Joe Russo introduced Robert by telling the crowd at Marvel’s panel how they made their casting decision for the character. “If we’re going to bring Victor Von Doom to the screen — he is one of the more complex characters in all of comics … this is potentially one of the more entertaining characters in all of fiction,” he explained. “If we’re going to do this, then we are going to need the greatest actor in the world. As proof of the unimaginable possibilities of the Marvel Universe, we give you the one person who could play Victor von Doom.” @supes ROBERT DOWNEY JR. RETURNS TO MARVEL!!! #supes #marvel #avengers #secretwars #comiccon ♬ original sound – SUPES Robert then walked downstage to unmask himself, and said, “New mask, same task. What can I say? I like playing complicated characters.” Avengers: Doomsday will be released in May 2026. Afterward, Joe and Anthony Russo spoke to the audience about their films while a montage of their work played on the screen. They also teased SDCC fans with the next Avengers installment, Secret Wars. “That four-movie run was incredible,” Anthony pointed out about his and Joe’s movies. “And it left us really spent, with all of our emotions on the floor. In the time since, through a very special story, Joe and I have come to potentially see a road forward with you all.” Joe then noted, “It’s the biggest story that Marvel Comics ever told; it’s the first comic book run that I read as a kid that made me fall in love with comics. It’s the reason why Ant and I are standing up here. And I think you all the know the name of it.” Avengers: Secret Wars is set to come out in May 2027. Earlier this year, Robert told Esquire that he’d “happily” return to the MCU if given the chance. “It’s too integral a part of my DNA. That role chose me,” he said in April about his character Iron Man, who died in Avengers: Endgame after sacrificing himself to defeat Thanos. “And look, I always say, never, ever bet against Kevin Feige. It is a losing bet. He’s the house. He will always win.”",

                    "text": "Robert Downey Jr. is returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Doctor Doom in a new “Avengers” movie titled “Avengers: Doomsday,” which will be directed by Joe and Anthony Russo in their own return to Marvel. The directing duo is on deck to helm two new “Avengers” movie: “Doomsday,” which will introduce Victor von Doom/Doctor Doom, and “Avengers: Secret Wars.” While Downey had said in recent interviews that he was open to returning to Marvel, fans naturally assumed that meant he would come back as Iron Man/Tony Stark. Downey’s return as the villainous Victor von Doom comes as a massive shock to the fandom, including the ecstatic audience at Marvel’s presentation at San Diego Comic-Con. Downey made a victorious appearance to Hall H on Saturday evening to reveal his return. Downey’s very first appearance as the playboy super-genius Stark came in 2008’s “Iron Man,” which was the first installment in the interconnected Marvel Cinematic Universe devised by Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige. Over the next 11 years, Downey would reprise the role in 10 Marvel films, including “Iron Man 2,” “Iron Man 3,” “The Incredible Hulk,” “The Avengers,” “Captian America: Civil War,” “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Avengers: Endgame.” “Endgame” featured the death of Iron Man. Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige stressed to Vanity Fair last December that he had no interest in messing with Downey’s emotional exit. “We are going to keep that moment and not touch that moment again,” Feige said at the time about Iron Man’s death. “We all worked very hard for many years to get to that, and we would never want to magically undo it in any way.” Downey is now returning to Marvel, but not as Iron Man. The actor had been quite open this year about his interest in coming back to the franchise. Speaking to Esquire magazine after his Oscar win for “Oppenheimer,” the actor was asked if he would ever return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe now that he is officially an Academy Award winner. The actor didn’t hesitate to answer yes. “Happily. It’s too integral a part of my DNA,” Downey said. “That role chose me. And look, I always say, ‘Never, ever bet against Kevin Feige.’ It is a losing bet. He’s the house. He will always win.”",

                    "text": "During its Hall H Comic-Con panel on Saturday, Marvel Studios unveiled new footage from Captain America: Brave New World, its superhero flick set to hit theaters on February 14, 2025. Introducing Giancarlo Esposito as villain Sidewinder, the clip opens with a speech at the White House from President Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross (Harrison Ford), who appeared on panel today. “When a celestial mass emerged in the Indian Ocean, we did what we often do. We squabbled over it, countries rushed in to claim it as their own, setting up research facilities to exploit its resources,” he said. “But the truth is, this new element belongs to all of us. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Adamantium. It’s in a secure location, and we have own own Captain America to thank for that.” Later, when Ross speaks with Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) aka Captain America, he tells him that he knows “we haven’t always agreed in the past, but what you’ve accomplished has made me reconsider.” This, he says, “is why I want you to help me rebuild the Avengers. The country needs this. Work with me, Sam. We’ll show the world a better way forward.” Directed by Julius Onah, Brave New World follows Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson (previously known as The Falcon), watching as he’s recruited by newly elected U.S. President Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross (Harrison Ford) to fill the Captain vacancy post Chris Evans’ Steve Rogers and become a U.S. agent. Brave New World marks the fourth installment of the Captain America franchise and the first since Evans bid adieu to the MCU in 2019’s Avengers: Endgame. Introduced as Wilson in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Mackie then went on to play the part in 2015’s Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, as well the Emmy-nominated Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, where he first assumed the mantle of Captain America. Dalan Musson and Malcolm Spellman each penned drafts of Captain America: Brave New World, with Matthew Orton more recently being hired to pen additional scenes and material. In addition to Mackie and Ford, the film stars Danny Ramirez, Shira Haas, Xosha Roquemore, Carl Lumbly, Giancarlo Esposito, Liv Tyler and Tim Blake Nelson. Kevin Feige and Nate Moore produced, with Louis D’Esposito and Charles Newirth serving as executive producers. Today’s Marvel news comes at a time when the studio has begun recalibrating, lifting the pressure to produce as much content as possible with a new mandate of two films per year. Already past the release of Phase Five titles Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and The Marvels, with Deadpool & Wolverine currently in theaters, the studio has set Thunderbolts* to wrap up that cycle on May 5, 2025. Opening with The Fantastic Four on July 25, 2025, Phase Six will also feature Blade (November 7, 2025), Avengers 5 (May 1, 2026), and Avengers: Secret Wars (May 7, 2027). This year’s edition of San Diego Comic-Con runs through Sunday, July 28.",

                    "text": "“Captain America: Brave New World” was a huge piece of Marvel’s massive Hall H presentation at San Diego Comic-Con this year, with fans getting an exclusive first look at footage from the film. From onstage Kevin Feige said, “There was a movie called ‘Captain America: Winter Soldier that was grounded, relatively grounded.” Feige said that they have returned to that “level of grounded action movie.” Anthony Mackie, onstage with the rest of the cast, described Sam as being a “cerebral character,” linking his character to his first introduction in “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” when he was a counselor. Also revealed on stage: that Giancarlo Esposito will be playing Sidewinder, the king of the Serpent Society, a comic book villain first introduced in 1980. (Incredibly, the character was added entirely during the film’s extensive reshoots.) The movie, set to release in February, follows Sam Wilson (Mackie) as he fully embraces his role as the new Captain America. He struggled with the idea of taking the mantle from Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) in “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,” but after John Walker (Wyatt Russell) took the super soldier serum and, well, became unhinged in the job, Sam finally embraced what his friend wanted for him. Now the struggle is, President Thunderbolt Ross (Harrison Ford, taking over the role from the late William Hurt) wants to make Captain America an official military position. As the first trailer for the movie made clear, the two clash on this idea. Of course, Thunderbolt Ross has superpowers of his own — he’s also the Red Hulk. In the footage shown at SDCC, Ford’s President is seen at the White House, hosting “a historic event.” It seems that Captain America (now Mackie) has recovered a stockpile of adamantium, the extremely valuable substance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. What’s more, Ford’s Thunderbolt Ross wants Captain America to “rebuild the Avengers.” “The threats show no signs of slowing down,” Ross said. There’s an attack on the White House, Ross is freaked out. Cap springs into action. There is a lot of footage from the already-released trailer, but we do get more footage of Ford’s Red Hulk. At the end of the footage President Ross is giving a press conference. He leans down, the desk starts shaking and as he rises up the Red Hulk, looking very much like Harrison Ford, rises up. As the footage wrapped up, Ford, who is notoriously averse to San Diego Comic-Con, showed up on stage. “This is a character that’s based on a lot of history, developed with Bill [William hurt] who played the character previously, but now I am Thaddeus and I am delighted and proud to become a member of the Marvel Universe,” Ford told the delighted crowd. The film also stars Danny Ramirez, Shira Haas, Xosha Roquemore, Carl Lumbly, Giancarlo Esposito, Liv Tyler and Tim Blake Nelson. “Captain America: Brave New World” is produced by Kevin Feige and Nate Moore. Louis D’Esposito and Charles Newirth serve as executive producers. “Captain America: Brave New World” hits theaters on February 14, 2025.",

During Marvel's panel at San Diego Comic-Con 2024, the Better Call Saul actor joined co-stars Tim Blake Nelson, Danny Ramirez, and Anthony Mackie to talk about the upcoming superhero movie, which sees the latter's Sam Wilson step into his role as the titular shield-bearer. Up until now, the identity of Esposito's villain had been kept under wraps, so he could hardly believe it when he was given the go-ahead to reveal it by Kevin Feige on stage in Hall H. \"It's like a dream come true,\" he told moderator Rob Delaney. \"When your dreams come true and you get the call, you walk through the door. I have a great deal of gratitude to all the fans who really had this dream come true. It was actually fan casting that linked us together,\" he continued, gesturing towards Feige. \"We started to talk, and everyone wanted me to be one thing, or another thing; there's been a lot of going on about who I really am,\" Esposito continued. \"Can I say it? I am... Can I say it? I can say it! Wow, let's finally unleash it... I am the King of the Serpent Society... I'm Seth Voelker... Sidewinder!\" Created by writer Mark Gruenwald and artist Ralph Macchio, Voekler is a economics professor-turned-crime boss, who was chemically mutated him by the Roxxon Oil Company, in the comics. As a result of the accident, he developed the ability to teleport using a special cloak. Throughout his run, his most notable clashes have been with the likes of Scarlet Witch, Triton, Stingray, and Fantastic Four's The Thing. Officially titled Captain America: Brave New World, the Marvel Phase 5 movie picks up in the aftermath of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier finale, which saw Sam Wilson finally accept the mantle of Cap. Ramirez will suit up as the new Falcon, while Harrison Ford is stepping in for the late William Hurt as Thunderbolt Ross, who is now President of the United States. Intriguingly, the first trailer for Brave New World revealed Ross as Red Hulk, a reveal we were certain would be kept for the movie itself. The rest of the cast includes Tim Blake Nelson returning as the Leader, with Liv Tyler back as Betty Ross, and Carl Lumbly back as Isaiah Bradley.

                    "text": "Giancarlo Esposito showing up in a movie may not be good news for the main characters, but it’s great for audiences. The actor has earned a name for portraying implacably charismatic villains, and the first trailer for Captain America: Brave New World raised the question: Which villain is he playing this time? Esposito was a late addition to the delayed Sam Wilson feature, which completed principle photography in the middle of 2023, and has undergone several months of reshoots and rewrites in 2024 — more than usual for an MCU film. Both Esposito and Rosa Salazar (Alita: Battle Angel) joined the cast during reshoots, and Marvel Studios kept their roles under wraps until the studio’s San Diego Comic-Con panel in Hall H this Saturday. In the comics, the Serpent Society is a consortium of supervillains who decided they would be more successful if they worked together — and they all happened to be snake-themed, so that was convenient. The group was founded by Seth Voelker, code name Sidewinder, whose skills were a head for business (evil business) and a cloak that allowed him to teleport (evil teleport, probably). Given that Captain America: Brave New World is being billed as a political thriller, however, it seems likely that this won’t exactly be the Sidewinder who comics fans are familiar with. Before the official confirmation of Esposito’s character, the internet rumor mill was hard at work, with many adopting the idea that Esposito was playing a completely different character: the best-named SHIELD agent in Marvel Comics canon, G.W. Bridge. G.W. Bridge is a badass government agent who shares a name with the world’s busiest motor vehicle bridge. But he isn’t a character who’s ever been closely associated with Captain America or Sam Wilson — and SHIELD doesn’t really exist in the MCU anymore. But we’re in an era in which any and all potential X-Men connections in the MCU are worthy of scrutiny, and G.W. Bridge did begin his comic book existence as a supporting cast member of X-Force, the X-Men’s spec-ops team. While Sidewinder doesn’t link Captain America: Brave New World up with the X-Men, he’s the king of the Serpent Society. We expect Esposito to pack plenty of menace.

                    "text": "Marvel's new Cap dropped into Comic-Con 2024 to preview the Brave New World coming to the MCU, including one big character reveal. Giancarlo Esposito (The Boys, Better Call Saul) joined the cast of Captain America: Brave New World late in the game as part of reshoots. Marvel had kept his role strictly under wraps, but the word out of the comic book giant's big Hall H panel on Saturday night is that Esposito is playing Sidewinder, the leader of the villainous organization known in the comics as the Serpent Society. \"It's a dream come true,\" he told the gathered fans. \"It was fan casting that linked us together and we started to talk. There's a lot of guessing about who I really am. But to be with this cast, especially Anthony Mackie... Can I say it? Wow! I can finally unleash it. I am the King of the Serpent Society. I am Sidewinder!\" The inclusion of Sidewinder and the Serpent Society is sort of an inside joke for Marvel fans. During a Marvel fan event in Los Angeles years ago that announced Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther and a whole slate of upcoming MCU movies, including Avengers: Infinity War, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige pulled a fast one by initially claiming the third Captain America movie would be Captain America: Serpent Society. At the end of that panel, he finally revealed the real title to be Captain America: Civil War. Anthony Mackie reprises his role as Sam Wilson, who now dons the title of Captain America. Mackie was on hand at Comic-Con alongside Esposito, director Julius Onah, and actors Harrison Ford (President Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross), Danny Ramirez (Joaquin Torres), Esposito (Sidewinder), and Tim Blake Nelson (returning as Samuel Sterns from The Incredible Hulk).

In Captain America: Brave New World, Sam meets with President Ross, who tells the new Cap to re-assemble the Avengers team. But first, there's an international situation that needs dealing with. After someone activates long-dormant sleeper-agent brainwashing within Isaiah and other super-soldiers visiting the White House to attack Ross, Sam realizes the president's inner circle is compromised, and there's a nefarious plot at play that could impact the entire world. \"Sam is surrounded by a host of very good intricate characters that help him move through the plot,\" Mackie said at the panel. \"He's a more cerebral, thoughtful character. He keeps that counseling, he keeps that course throughout the film.\" Footage shown in the room of Captain America: Brave New World introduces adamantium, the fictional metal from the comics that is famously grafted to Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) skeleton, into the MCU. Ross reveals adamantium is on Earth and that it has been recovered and taken to a secure location, thanks to Cap. Nelson's character is destined to transmogrify into the comic book villain known as the Leader, but the actor wouldn't say much. \"No spoilers. I want them to bring me back,\" he said. \"They wrote a great story for him and I think people are going to be pretty excited,\" Nelson added.Ramirez was a bit more forthcoming, confirming that Joaquin Torres (returning from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier) is destined to become the new Falcon. \"I feel at home in the skies,\" Ramirez said, likely referring to his recent role in Top Gun: Maverick. \"It's cool to take these wings that have gone through many iterations and have gone through wear and tear through the years. I thought they also came with knee braces because they're a little older. But it felt good to be back up there.\" Ford, who's confirmed to make Ross' transformation into Red Hulk, said of his role as the president, \"I make no reference to current history. None. This is a character that's based on the very, um, a lot of history developed with Bill, who played the character previously.\" (William Hurt originated the role of Ross, though the character was recast with Ford after Hurt's death in 2022.) \"But now I am Thaddeus, and I am elated, and I am proud to become a member of the Marvel universe,\" Ford continued after crowd applause for Hurt. \"I have been watching fantastic actors, some of which are here tonight, have a really good time working in the Marvel universe and I wanted a piece of the action. I'm very proud to be in this film.\" Captain America: Brave New World will be the next MCU film to hit theaters after this weekend's Deadpool & Wolverine. The film will open on Feb. 14, 2025. —Reporting by Sydney Bucksbaum.",

                    "text": "Marvel fans got a first, very intriguing Captain America: Brave New World trailer earlier in July, but on the occasion of San Diego Comic-Con, Marvel gave fans inside its Hall H panel an even better look at the studio’s next movie starring one of its flagship heroes. Introduced by Kevin Feige to open the proceedings in Hall H tonight, the footage began at the White House. President Ross (Harrison Ford) is hosting an event about the celestial mass that appeared on Earth. He explains that when that happened, many different people rushed to try and claim it. It was a whole mess. But, thanks to Captain America, they finally have found something of value. A new element: adamantium. Yes, that adamantium. In a new scene that seems to come after, we see Sam (Anthony Mackie) and Ross speaking in the Oval Office. He wants Cap to rebuild the Avengers but, Cap points out, Ross’ Sokovia Accords previously destroyed the Avengers. So, he asks, what happens when they disagree? We don’t get an answer. A bunch of action scenes, including a big part of the White House being destroyed, happen and we see Sam in a normal suit strutting into the Situation Room. He says he has to talk to the President. Everyone leaves, except one woman: Ruth (Shira Haas). Ross says she stays no matter what. Apparently, Sam is worried that Ross’s inner circle has been compromised and Ross tells Ruth to put it to bed. Sam says that’s bullshit. Ross says it’s politics. A person in a hood kills a bunch of people in a room. Captain America and Falcon (Danny Ramirez) are flying around together. We see Cap throw the shield from the air with the wings spread out. The phrase “The Future Favors the Brave” appears on screen. Ross is giving a speech outside the White House. Shots are fired, he ducks down and starts to Hulk out. Out emerges Red Hulk, with Harrison Ford’s face via motion capture. Captain America: Brave New World stars Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson, who took over the mantle of Captain America from Chris Evans’ Steve Rogers. His co-stars include Harrison Ford (as Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, a role formerly played in the MCU by the late William Hurt), Danny Ramirez, Shira Haas, Xosha Roquemore, Carl Lumbly, Giancarlo Esposito—whose villainous role is now confirmed to be Seth Voelker, aka Sidewinder, a founding member of the Serpent Society—Liv Tyler, and Tim Blake Nelson. Captain America: Brave New World will arrive in theaters February 14, 2025. Additional reporting by Germain Lussier. Want more io9 news?

Satin gold and red robed choir members took the stage to belt out the Madonna song, which is something of an anthem in Deadpool & Wolverine. Various Deadpool, a bullet written one, another one wearing an inflated Wolverine, danced through the aisles before Marvel President and Producer Kevin Feige took the mic. “I saw a Bob Ross Deadpool, a Woody Deadpool — is there a Peter Pool?” At which point Rob Delaney aka Peter in Deadpool & Wolverine took the stage to become the night’s MC.

Originally known as Seth Voelker ,an Economics professor before Roxxon Oil Company chemically mutated him and gave him the power to teleport, starting his criminal career as Sidewinder.

She participated in warmups, shorting the Yurchenko double pike vault that’s become her signature. There were no issues about 10 minutes later when she attempted it for the judges, taking a big step back, a byproduct of the massive momentum she generates when she explodes off the vaulting table. She scored 15.800 — by far the highest in the world this year — and followed it up landing her Cheng vault with no major problems, though she was noticeably limping as she made her way back to her seat.

                    "text": "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) — Simone Biles didn't let some leg discomfort slow her down. The American gymnastics superstar posted an all-around total of 59.566 during Olympic qualifying on Sunday inside a packed and star-studded Bercy Arena despite complaining of a left calf injury that had her limping. U.S. gymnastics coach Cecile Landi said the issue popped up a couple of weeks ago and described it as minor. Landi said there was no discussion of pulling Biles' from the event. “I can’t express it,” she said. “I’m really proud of her and what she’s been through and what she’s showing the world what she’s capable of doing.” After dazzling on the balance beam, Biles appeared to tweak the leg while warming up on floor exercise during the second rotation. She exited the floor with Team USA doctor Marcia Faustin — a scene that played out three years ago in Tokyo when Biles removed herself from the team final to protect her safety. This wasn't deja vu, however. The 27-year-old returned to the floor a few minutes later with her left leg taped and was heard on camera saying she felt something in her calf. She put on a show-stopping performance anyway. Biles posted the highest score on floor and vault through two subdivisions, a position she'll likely find herself in at the end of the day as she tries to add to her career total of seven Olympic medals. The only adjustment she made was deciding to skip attempting a unique skill on uneven bars she submitted to the International Gymnastics Federation on Friday. Instead, she did her usual set to score a 14.333. She tried to keep from putting too much weight on her leg following her dismount. Her day's work done, Biles celebrated by waving to the crowd and dancing with friend and longtime teammate Jordan Chiles as the five-woman U.S. team zoomed to the top of the leaderboard as expected. The Americans scored a 172.296, well clear of the field after two subdivisions as they search for what they're calling “redemption” after finishing runner-up to Russia three years ago. The question now: Will Biles' leg be an ongoing issue? The team final is Tuesday, and the women’s all-around final is Thursday. The stands were buzzing and filled with celebrities. Tom Cruise posed for selfies while waiting for Biles to emerge. Snoop Dogg had front-row seats, and Ariana Grande, Jessica Chastain, John Legend and Anna Wintour were also on hand.

                    "text": "PARIS (AP) — The similarities were striking. Maybe fitting in the birth place of déjà vu. Simone Biles sitting off to the side at the Olympics. USA gymnastics team doctor Marcia Faustin by her side. A look of concern on both their faces. Three years ago in Tokyo, the scene ended with Biles removing herself from multiple finals to protect her safety — prompting an international discussion about mental health. Yet Biles is determined to write a different ending to the story in Paris. The 27-year-old American star wasn’t dealing with any sort of block or trauma but something far more common to gymnasts, particularly ones who have been doing this two decades. Just like in Tokyo, Biles and Faustin briefly disappeared. Unlike Tokyo, Biles returned not in a sweatsuit but with her left leg heavily taped after tweaking her calf during her warm-up on floor exercise. She spent the rest of the afternoon walking around with a noticeable limp everywhere except the competition floor. The woman who has been saying over and over and over this isn’t 2021 went out and proved it on Sunday inside star-studded Bercy Arena, shaking off what U.S. coach Cecile Landi described as a minor calf issue to post the top score in the all-around and put whatever lingering ghosts there may be from Tokyo in the rearview mirror. Biles finished at 59.566, well clear of reigning Olympic champion and teammate Sunisa Lee, saluting the crowd after her dismount on uneven bars, her final event. She hopped off the podium, danced with good friend Jordan Chiles and has no plans to stop her quest for gold in Tuesday’s team final and Thursday’s individual all-around. “It was pretty amazing, 59.5,” Landi said. “Not perfect so she can improve even (but) … just really good.” Landi said the issue popped up a couple of weeks ago and described it as minor. There was no discussion of Biles pulling out. Instead, Landi and her husband Laurent — who have long served as Biles’ personal coach in Texas — encouraged her to take a breath and keep going as Laurent applied heavy doses of tape to her leg. “We told her to remind herself, like she’s capable of doing it,” Landi said. “She knows she’s got it and it’s OK and then she did. So, really excited for her.” The issue hardly slowed Biles. She posted the highest score on floor and vault through two subdivisions, a position she’ll likely find herself in at the end of the day as she tries to add to her career total of seven Olympic medals. The only adjustment she made was deciding to skip attempting a unique skill on uneven bars she submitted to the International Gymnastics Federation on Friday. Instead, she did her usual set to score a 14.333. The Americans scored a 172.296, well clear of the field after two subdivisions as they search for what they’re calling “redemption” after finishing runner-up to Russia three years ago. “They’re happy and relieved,” Landi said. “Day one, now moving on to team finals, all-around finals, a couple event finals hopefully.” Landi said Biles’ leg was feeling better as she moved through the events and expects her to be available going forward. The injury added a dash of drama to an event that’s become a must-see for athletes and celebrities alike. The stands were buzzing and filled with stars. Tom Cruise posed for selfies while waiting for Biles to emerge. Snoop Dogg had front-row seats, and Ariana Grande, Jessica Chastain, John Legend and Anna Wintour were also on hand. Biles arrived in Paris as the face of the U.S. Olympic movement and maybe the Olympics themselves. The buzz around her return to the Games has been palpable, with NBC leaning heavily into her star power by splashing Biles’ face on countless promotions in the lead-up to Paris. Her gravitational pull is real. Athletes across the Olympic spectrum have said they want to make it a point to catch the most decorated gymnast of all time in what could be the final competition of her unparalleled career. Among them: LeBron James and the U.S. men’s basketball team, which was busy Sunday with Olympic qualifying.",

So, really excited for her.” The issue hardly slowed her down. Biles posted the highest score on floor and vault — both after the injury — as she tries to add to her career total of seven Olympic medals. The only event final Biles is likely to miss is uneven bars, where she opted not to attempt a unique skill she submitted to the International Gymnastics Federation on Friday. She can still opt to do it during the team final, opening the door for it to be entered into the sport’s Code of Points with her name attached. Yet that appeared to be far from Biles’ mind when he finished up her bars set. Instead, there was a mixture of relief and the urge to soak in the moment following her dismount at what could be the final competition of her unparalleled career. The same could be said of her teammates after the heavily favored Americans finished at 172.296, more than five points clear of Italy (166.861) through two of five subdivisions as they search for what they’re calling “redemption” following a runner-up finish to Russia three years ago. “They’re happy and relieved,” Landi said. “Day one, now moving on to team finals, all-around finals, a couple event finals hopefully.” Landi said Biles’ leg was feeling better as she moved through the events and expects her to be available going forward. The reality is the Americans — especially with Russia out of the mix due to the war in Ukraine — don’t need to rely on her as much as they have in previous Games. Biles, Lee and Chiles went 1-2-3 in the all-around during early qualifying, though Chiles will miss the all-around final due to rules that limit countries to entering two athletes per competition. There’s a chance Chiles will make the floor exercise final should she finish in the top eight. Lee is practically a lock for the beam and bars finals, with 2020 floor exercise champion Jade Carey in good position to join Biles in the vault final. That is, of course, if Biles is healthy. The injury added a dash of drama to an event that’s become a must-see for athletes and celebrities alike. The stands were buzzing and filled with stars. Tom Cruise posed for selfies while waiting for Biles to emerge. Snoop Dogg had front-row seats, and Ariana Grande, Jessica Chastain, John Legend and Anna Wintour were also on hand. Biles arrived in Paris as the face of the U.S. Olympic movement and maybe the Olympics themselves.

Among them: LeBron James and the U.S. men’s basketball team, which was busy Sunday with Olympic qualifying. Biles has spent the last 11 years largely avoiding the kind of physical setbacks that have ended the Olympic journeys of so many others. Not for Biles — not yet anyway — as her chance at a golden send-off remains very much in the offing even if she literally is now forced to take it one ginger step at a time.",

You can find them here: ForbesToday's 'Wordle' #1134 Hints, Clues And Answer For Saturday, July 27thBy Erik Kain I figured, since it’s Sunday and all and we’re doing our best to be lazy, that we could take a stroll down memory lane and see what big, earth-shattering events took place on this day—July 28th—throughout history. Turns out it’s been kind of a crazy day, with executions of prominent leaders, the opening shots of major wars and other pretty wild events. Behold: 1540 - Thomas Cromwell, a chief minister to King Henry VIII of England, was executed. 1794 - Maximilien Robespierre, a key figure in the French Revolution, was executed by guillotine. 1821 - José de San Martín declared the independence of Peru from Spain. 1868 - The 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution was certified, granting citizenship to formerly enslaved people. 1914 - Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, marking the beginning of World War I. 1945 - A B-25 bomber crashed into the 79th floor of the Empire State Building in New York City. 1958 - The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created by the National Aeronautics and Space Act. 1976 - The Tangshan earthquake struck in China, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. 1996 - The Centennial Olympic Park bombing occurred during the Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. Let’s hope this July 28th is less interesting! And let’s do this Wordle! How To Solve Today’s Wordle The Hint: A useful garment for painters. The Clue: This Wordle has far more consonants than vowels. Okay, spoilers below! . . . The Answer: Today's Wordle Can you solve today’s phrase? Play Now Credit: Erik Kain Wordle Analysis Every day I check Wordle Bot to help analyze my guessing game. You can check your Wordles with Wordle Bot right here. I didn’t realize how lucky my opening guess was until I read the Wordle Bot analysis later, but if I’d known I only had 12 words left I might have done things differently. As it stands, CHORE left me in a pretty good spot and I effectively squandered that with my next guess—appropriately, the word SCOWL. This did slash the number of remaining solutions down to just 3, and gave me a green ‘S’ but apparently three was too many, and STOIC was not the right choice. It did, however, leave me with just one remaining solution: SMOCK for the win! Huzzah! Competitive Wordle Score I get zero points for guessing in 4 but I do get one point for beating the Bot, who took five tries today (having guessed SHOCK on its fourth guess). Huzzah for humanity! How To Play Competitive Wordle Guessing in 1 is worth 3 points; guessing in 2 is worth 2 points; guessing in 3 is worth 1 point; guessing in 4 is worth 0 points; guessing in 5 is -1 points; guessing in 6 is -2 points and missing the Wordle is -3 points. If you beat your opponent you get 1 point. If you tie, you get 0 points. And if you lose to your opponent, you get -1 point. Add it up to get your score. Keep a daily running score or just play for a new score each day. Fridays are 2XP, meaning you double your points—positive or negative. You can keep a running tally or just play day-by-day. Enjoy! Today’s Wordle Etymology The word \"smock\" has an interesting etymology that traces back through several languages and centuries. Old English: The term \"smock\" comes from the Old English word \"smoc,\" which referred to a garment worn by women and later by men as an undergarment or a protective outer garment. Germanic Roots: The Old English \"smoc\" is derived from the Proto-Germanic word \"*smukkaz,\" which means \"a garment.\" This Proto-Germanic word is also the root of similar words in other Germanic languages, such as Middle Low German \"smocke\" and Old High German \"smoccho.\" Proto-Indo-European: The ultimate origin is thought to be the Proto-Indo-European root \"*smeug,\" which means \"to slip\" or \"to creep.\" This root suggests the idea of a garment that slips over the head and body, reflecting how a smock is typically worn. The word \"smock\" has evolved in meaning over time but has consistently referred to a type of loose-fitting garment used for protection or modesty. In modern usage, it often refers to a loose outer garment worn to protect clothes while working.

Wordle help: 3 tips for beating Wordle every day Anyone can pick up and play Wordle, but if you want to do it well and make all of your guesses count, these quick tips will help get you started on your Wordle winning streak: Choose an opener with a balanced mix of unique vowels and consonants. The answer may contain the same letter, multiple times.Try not to use guesses that contain letters you've already eliminated. Thankfully, there's no time limit beyond ensuring it's done by midnight. So there's no reason not to treat the game like a casual newspaper crossword and come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Sometimes stepping away for a while means you can come back with a fresh perspective. Wordle today: The answer What is today's Wordle answer? Help is here. The answer to the July 28 (1135) Wordle is SMOCK. Previous Wordle answers The last 10 Wordle answers Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle solutions: July 27: JUICEJuly 26: AWASHJuly 25: PORCHJuly 24: FORTEJuly 23: PRONGJuly 22: CADETJuly 21: SPECKJuly 20: SHAFTJuly 19: REFERJuly 18: NERDY Learn more about Wordle Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You should start with a strong word like ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. ? means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. ? means you've got the right letter in the right spot. You'll want your next guess to compliment the first, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you might have missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. After that, it's simply a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the correct word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words and don't forget letters can repeat too (eg: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out our Wordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineer Josh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons of games like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it was sold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes.",

                    "text": "Considering the global sensation it has become, Wordle has remarkably humble origins. It was invented during coronavirus lockdown by New York-based software developer Josh Wardle, who simply wanted a game \"for me and my partner to enjoy.\"In October 2021, Wardle released Wordle to the general public, and it developed a dedicated fan base around the world, with some players taking to social media each day to share hints as well as their results. This popularity allowed Wardle to sell Wordle to The New York Times in January 2022 for an undisclosed low seven-figure sum, though it remains free to play.Speaking to Newsweek, Erhan Aslan, an expert in linguistics who teaches at the University of Reading in the U.K., provided some advice for Wordle players.Aslan said: \"One thing that I think is important in this game is the starting word chosen. Starting off with words that include commonly used vowels, for example, e and a, consonants such as r and t, and sound sequences might be helpful. Choosing a word that starts with q, z, j, or x, for instance, may not be the best choice.\"As you get more feedback after a few guesses, users need to draw on some knowledge of phonics to narrow down or eliminate some words that they might be thinking,\" Aslan added. \"For example, if the second letter of the target word is l (indicated by green) and the player feels that the word starts with a consonant, they will need to know that there are only a few consonant cluster possibilities (such as bl, cl, fl, gl, pl, sl).\"The answer to Sunday's puzzle will be revealed at the end of this article, so scroll down with caution if you want to work it out for yourself.'Wordle' #1,135, Clues for Sunday, July 28Hint #1: The answer only contains one vowel.Hint #2: There are no repeated letters.Hint #3: A type of clothing.Hint #4: Often associated with being outdoors.Hint #5: One of the first three letters in the alphabet features.'Wordle' #1,135, Answer for Sunday, July 28The answer to today's Wordle puzzle is \"smock.\"Well that was fun! Did you get it? If so congratulations, but please don't be put off if not. One of the best things about Wordle is seeing if you can improve your result over time and Newsweek will be back on Monday with another round of hints and tips.What Does 'Smock' Mean?The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines \"smock\" as \"a light loose garment worn especially for protection of clothing while working.\"For example: \"In the 18th century portrait the shepherd tended his sheep while wearing a smock.\"",

TODAY'S WORDLE ANSWER Today's Wordle answer is SMOCK. Yesterday's Wordle answer Yesterday's Wordle answer, July 27, No. 1134, was JUICE. Past Wordle answers July 23, No. 1130: PRONG July 24, No. 1131: FORTE July 25, No. 1132: PORCH July 26, No. 1133: AWASH Everyday Wordle tips I've written a lot about Wordle -- from covering its 1,000th word to my list of the best starter words to a helpful two-step strategy to news about controversial word changes. I've even rounded up what I learned playing the hit online word puzzle for a full year. So if you're rethinking your need for the actual answer, you might try tips from one of those stories. Still need a starter word? One person told me they just look around and choose a five-letter object that they've spotted to use as their starter word -- such as COUCH or CHAIR. I tend to stick to starter words that have the most popular letters used in English words. I like TRAIN as a starter, though I have a friend who uses TRAIL. I've read that people use the financial term ROATE, but I like to use words I actually know. What is Wordle? If you read this far, you know how to play. You have six chances to guess a five-letter word, and the game gives you feedback as to whether the letters you've guessed are in the puzzle or not, and if they're in the same spot where you guessed they are. The New York Times bought the game from creator Josh Wardle for seven figures in 2022. Wardle famously created the game for his partner, and let her narrow down the 12,000 five-letter words in the English language to just 2,500, creating the database of answers. It was convenient, too, that he has a name that plays off \"word.\" A Times spokesperson told me it lists the very first Wordle as appearing on June 19, 2021, and the paper celebrated the game's 1,000th word on March 15. Spoiler: That 1,000th word was ERUPT. As in, \"Dad will erupt if the Wordle is so tough he loses his streak.\"",

                    "text": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, on \"Face the Nation\" that aired on July 28, 2024.ROBERT COSTA: We turn now to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Senator, good morning.SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: Good morning, good to be here.ROBERT COSTA: Senator, what's your response to the latest strikes in the Golan Heights?SEN. SCHUMER: Well, look, first we know that Iran, through its surrogates, Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis, is really the real evil in this area. And Israel has every right to defend itself against Hezbollah like they do against Hamas. It's sort of- it shows you how bad Iran and its surrogates are. These were Arab kids they shot out. They don't ca- they sent missiles at and they don't even care who that is. But having said that, I don't think anyone wants a wider war. So I hope there are moves to de-escalate.ROBERT COSTA: Sticking with the Middle East, Senator, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, just in Washington. You were part of the formal bipartisan invitation to have him come to Washington. Yet there was video of you not shaking his hand when he was on the floor on Capitol Hill. Why not? Why did you not shake his hand?SEN. SCHUMER: Well, look, you know, I went to this speech, because the relationship between Israel and America is ironclad and I wanted to show that. But at the same time, as everyone knows, I have serious disagreements with the way Benjamin Netanyahu has conducted these policies.ROBERT COSTA: Your colleague and friend, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, tweeted this this week, she said: \"Benjamin Netanyahu's presentation in the House chamber was by far the worst presentation of any foreign dignitary invited and honored with that privilege in American history.\" Do you agree with her assessment? And do you have any regrets at all--SEN. SCHUMER: --Look--ROBERT COSTA: --The invitation?SEN. SCHUMER: Look, no, as I've said, I want you to show our ironclad commitment to Israel that transcends any one prime minister, or any one president, no matter how much you might disagree with that prime minister.ROBERT COSTA: Senator, on July 13, you went to Delaware to meet with President Biden. It was a private discussion and I know you'd like to keep your discussions with the President private. But that for history was a very momentous meeting in the sense of you were the Senate Democratic leader, the Majority Leader meeting with the President to discuss the presidential race. For history, for the record, did you, in any way, suggest to the President that he should leave the presidential race on July 13?SEN. SCHUMER: Well, first, let's look at President Biden's record. He's had one of the most amazing presidencies we've had in decades, passing so many good things: the infrastructure bill, the IRA bill, getting the price of prescription drugs down for the first time, going against the NRA successfully, helping our veterans with burn pits. So he's had an amazingly successful record. And he's always done what's right for America. And I respect him, I respect his patriotism, I respect the amazing things he's done. We work together on many of them.ROBERT COSTA: But just for history, though, did you- what was your role, what was your intention with that meeting with him on July 13? Because some Biden allies feel heard about this entire process. I just sat down the other day was Senator Chris Coons, your colleague, and he said a lot of people feel hurt, angry about how this all played out and you did go to see him and conveyed the views of your colleagues based on our reporting. So what exactly happened there? What was your role, if any, and suggested he get out or stay?SEN. SCHUMER: As I said, yeah, I'm not going to get into the specifics. But he can- the Pres- President Biden will walk away from the presidency with his head held high, because of all the great things he's done and because he put America first he always has.ROBERT COSTA: Vice President Harris, now the presumptive nominee. Senator, are you encouraging Senate Democrats, including those in battleground states, to invite her to campaign with them to have her in their advertisements?SEN. SCHUMER: Yeah, the Biden-Harris record is just incredible, as I mentioned, all the specific things that has been- that they have passed together working with us. So it's an incredible record, and our senators are already talking about it. They're, you know, cutting ribbons and new bridges, they're bringing rural broadband, they're bringing broadband to rural areas, they're opening up new factories from chip fabs. So it's a great, great record, and it's helping our Senate candidates run on it. And let me just say one thing, just compare that to the Republican record to the Trump-Vance ticket. It's extreme, this Project 2025 shows that would take the rights away from women. It would take away rights of working people and help only the very wealthy, it would even be a threat to our democracy. And one more point about this, and that is the addition of JD Vance to this ticket. It's- it's incredibly a bad choice. I think Donald Trump, I know him, and he's probably sitting and watching the TV, and every day, Vance, it comes out Vance has done something more extreme, more weird, more erratic. Vance seems to be more erratic and more extreme than President Trump. And I'll bet President Trump is sitting there scratching his head and wondering, why did I pick this guy? The choice may be one of the best things he ever did for Democrats.ROBERT COSTA: What do you mean--SEN. SCHUMER: --Now the President has about 10 days- 10 days before the Ohio ballot is locked in. And he has a choice: does he keep Vance on the ticket, where he's- he probably- he's- he already has a whole lot of baggage, he's probably going to be more baggage over the weeks because we'll hear more things about him, or does he pick someone new? What's his choice?ROBERT COSTA: So Democrats focusing on Senator Vance, your colleague in the chamber, but Republicans seem to be focusing a lot on border policy and Vice President Harris. What's your suggestion about how she should handle that Republicans are saying she has fumbled the ball on immigration, on border policy? What's the answer for how to define her on herself on that issue? It's going to be brought up again and again on--SEN. SCHUMER: --The answer--ROBERT COSTA: --The campaign?SEN. SCHUMER: The answer is very simple. And that is that Democrats, along with the Biden Harris administration, put together the toughest border policy that would have stopped the flow from the border that we've seen in a very long time. In fact, initially was supported by Republicans. So many of the leading Republicans said, \"this is tough, we're all for it.\" And then all of a sudden, President Trump says it, he said it explicitly. He said, \"I don't want them to solve the problem, I want chaos at the border so I can run on it with the election.\" We're happy to bring that up. And case after case, when we bring that up, the voters side with us, not with their policies. We were willing to fix the border. Trump and his Republican minions said, don't fix it, we want chaos for political purposes. Who do you think's going to win the argument?ROBERT COSTA: Has Vice President Harris reached out to you about her vice president sel- selection? And do you have a leading contender or two that you believe would be helpful? And Senator Kelly, your colleague, is one of the contenders we've reported. Are you confident that if he goes on the ticket, you can hold on to that seat in a few years in a special?SEN. SCHUMER: Well, let me say this, I have complete confidence that Vice President Harris will choose a top-notch ticket and top-notch vice presidential candidate. We have a lot of- we have a very strong bench. There are a lot of good choices. I have confidence in her choice.ROBERT COSTA: Are you worried about the Senate majority? It's a narrow majority for you right now. What's your candid assessment about the Senate majority and Democratic chances?SEN. SCHUMER: My candid assessment is we're going to not only win the Senate, but we have a good chance to pick up a seat or two. Our candidates, our senators, are running on their records of accomplishment. And that's why they're running ahead of even the national ticket. Because when they show all the good stuff we're bringing to their states, through the infrastructure bill, through the Chips and Science Bill, was so many good new manufacturing jobs, through bringing broadband to rural areas for the first time, where rural areas desperately needed. You know, Franklin Roosevelt said in the 1930s, electricity was a necessity and brought it to them. We're doing the same thing with broad bands, which in the 21st century is a necessity--ROBERT COSTA: --Speaking about technology--SEN. SCHUMER: --We have a great record to run on and it's going to- it's going to- it's going to keep us- it's going to keep us in the majority.ROBERT COSTA: Staying with technology for a second. You've raised national security concerns about TikTok. Do you support the Harris campaign using TikTok to promote its candidate- her candidacy?SEN. SCHUMER: Look, I'm not going to get into the details of how to run the campaign. I'm talking about the message that they have and they should bring it forward in whatever way they can. We did vote to eliminate TikTok and in a period of less than a year that legislation will go into effect.ROBERT COSTA: And finally here, Senator, President Biden this week is going to make a push on the Supreme Court to reform the Supreme Court. What's really possible there, what's realistic? Give us your real view about whether this can happen this year on a- in a bipartisan way.SEN. SCHUMER: Well, first, let's start off. The Supreme Court is a morass. First, it's an ethical morass. The idea that wealthy individuals, many of them right-wing, can both have pay for cases before the Court and at the same time, give justices gifts or trips is outrageous. And frankly, Chief Justice Roberts isn't doing enough to curb it. But it's a morass and even a worse way this is a MAGA, right-wing Court. It's already taken the right away, the right to choose, it could very well go further on that, I fear it will. It's siding with the wealthiest of individuals and the powerful interests over the average working family. And it even threatens democracy when it says that a president can get immunity even for certain acts in the presidency. So this Court is- is just a morass, both ethically and substantively. And I think we will look at all the various proposals and see what should be done.ROBERT COSTA: And just quickly here, Senator, a lot is on the horizon for you. You have a possible shutdown this fall, the debt limit later this year. Are you engaged or prepared to engage with Speaker Johnson in the house to address these serious issues?SEN. SCHUMER: Well, we are prepared to engage, you have to do these things in a bipartisan way. And we keep reminding Speaker Johnson that the right-wing MAGA group in his- in his party, which wanted default, which wants to shut down the government, is so ideologically fixated on these things, that they would hurt tens of millions of American families and sometimes Speaker Johnson sides with them, sometimes he doesn't. He sides with them too much.ROBERT COSTA: A lot on your plate. Thank you, Senator Schumer. We appreciate your time and Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",

Organizers said they nixed the swimming leg of the triathlon familiarization scheduled for Sunday morning after a meeting about water quality among authorities tasked with carrying out water quality tests. That included representatives of World Triathlon, as well as city and regional authorities. Swimming in the Seine has been banned for over a century in big part due to poor water quality. Organizers have invested $1.5 billion to prepare the Seine for these Games, and the government has said the river would be clean enough to hold events, including the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming event. Daily water quality tests in early June indicated unsafe levels of E. coli bacteria, followed by recent improvements. Parisian Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a famous dip in the river less than two weeks before Olympic events were set to start, fulfilling a promise to show that the long-polluted waterway was clean enough to host swimming competitions. Heavy rain during the opening ceremony revived concerns over whether the long-polluted waterway will be clean enough to host swimming competitions, since water quality is deeply linked with the weather in the French capital. Since 2015, organizers have invested heavily to prepare the Seine for the Olympics and to ensure Parisians have a cleaner river after the Games. The plan included constructing a giant underground water storage basin in central Paris, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants. Triathleletes have expressed hope that the waters would be clean enough for them to swim in. “Hopefully we get to swim, bike and run because I don’t swim this much to just run and bike,” Spanish triathlete Alberto Gonzalez said.",

                    "text": "The Olympic triathlon swimming training session scheduled for Sunday has been cancelled after recent heavy rain in Paris affected pollution levels in the Seine, organisers said in a statement. A lot is riding on Olympic triathletes being cleared to swim in Paris' central waterway when the competition kicks off on Tuesday, with France investing €1.4 billion ($1.52bn) in new wastewater infrastructure to cut sewage levels and make the river swimmable for residents as a key legacy of the Games. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip in the Seine on July 17 to try to convince doubters that the water will be clean enough for athletes to compete in the river, as they did during the 1900 Olympics. When Hidalgo swam in the river, E.coli levels were above the levels deemed safe by World Triathlon, the sport's governing body. \"We have had some rainfall but everything that has been put in place has worked, it prevents overflows from occurring so I think we will reach a satisfying quality of the water very soon, but it will depend on the weather forecast as well,\" Pierre Rabadan, the city's deputy mayor for sports, told a news conference on Sunday. Tests carried out in the Seine on Saturday \"revealed water quality levels that in the view of the international federation, World Triathlon, did not provide sufficient guarantees to allow the event to be held,\" organisers Paris 2024 said in a statement. \"This is due to rain that has fallen on Paris on July 26-27.\" Organisers said that, given the forecast for sunshine and higher temperatures over the next 48 hours, they were \"confident\" water quality would improve again before the triathlon events begin on Tuesday with the men's race. World Triathlon meets with Paris city authorities at 4 a.m. each morning ahead of triathlon training or competition events to analyse the latest water test results and decide whether the Seine is clean enough for athletes to swim. Should the water quality not improve in time for the triathlon, World Triathlon rules allow for the competition to be held as a duathlon. The running and cycling course familiarisation sessions were going ahead as planned on Sunday. The French capital has been working on cleaning up the Seine so people can swim in it again, as was the case during the 1900 Paris Olympics. In May, the city unveiled a new 46,000-cubic metre storage basin meant to contain rainwater and waste water to reduce pollution levels in the river.",

                    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has raised $200 million since she emerged as the likely Democratic presidential nominee last week, an eyepopping haul in her race against the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump. The campaign, which announced its latest fundraising total on Sunday, said the bulk of the donations — 66% — comes from first-time contributors in the 2024 election cycle and were made after President Joe Biden announced his exit from the race and endorsed Harris. Over 170,000 volunteers have also signed up to help the Harris campaign with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts. Election Day is 100 days away. “The momentum and energy for Vice President Harris is real — and so are the fundamentals of this race: this election will be very close and decided by a small number of voters in just a few states,” Michael Tyler, the campaign’s communications director, wrote in a memo. Harris campaigned in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on Saturday, drawing hundreds to a fundraiser that had been organized when Biden was still at the top of the Democratic ticket. The fundraiser had originally been expected to raise $400,000 but ended bringing in about $1.4 million, according to the campaign. Harris quickly coalesced Democratic support after Biden, whose candidacy fizzled following his disastrous June 27 debate performance against Trump, exited the race. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, former House Minority Whip Jim Clyburn, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were quick to announce their support. Prodigious Democratic fundraisers former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama announced their endorsement on Friday. Harris at her Saturday fundraiser said she remained the “underdog” in the race but that her campaign was picking up steam. Future Forward, the largest super PAC in Democratic politics, announced last week it had secured $150 million in commitments over the first 24 hours from donors after Biden bowed out and endorsed Harris. Democratic House and Senate candidates say they also have seen a surge in support since Harris emerged as the party’s likely nominee. (Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

According to the campaign, 66% of donations came from first-time donors. Harris’s campaign also recruited 170,000 new volunteers in the past week and has plans to host 2,300 events in efforts to mobilize grassroots supporters this weekend. Harris attended a fundraiser in Massachusetts Saturday, and expected to bring in $1.4 million for the campaign from that fundraiser, according to the Washington Post. In a race against former President Donald Trump, a CNN/SSRS poll released this week showed Trump up 49% to Harris’s 46%, but that represents a tie as both those figures are within the poll’s margin of error. In the first week of her candidacy, most of the Democratic party has rallied around her. She has received the endorsement of Democratic leadership in the House and Senate and of former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama and former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. Her campaign has said she has had enough delegates move from Biden to Harris to secure the party’s nomination ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August.",

The campaign, which announced the total on Sunday, said 66% of the funds came from first-time donors, touting grassroots support for Harris' bid. And the campaign said the support has extended to its volunteer effort, with over 170,000 new volunteers coming onboard since last week's announcement. \"Vice President Harris has been a candidate for less than a week, but she's already coalesced the entire Democratic Party around her campaign and the organic, grassroots enthusiasm is producing results,\" the campaign's communications director, Michael Tyler, wrote in a memo.The fundraising haul comes after the campaign said it raked in more than $100 million in the day following Mr. Biden's announcement that he would suspend his campaign. In the days that followed, Harris received endorsements from large swaths of the party, including individuals who had been seen as possible White House contenders, while winning endorsements from the bulk of the party's 4,000 pledged delegates — making her the presumptive nominee. On Saturday, Harris attended her first major fundraiser since becoming the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. The party will officially select its new nominee in early August in a virtual roll-call vote. Harris made the campaign pitch at an event in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where she spoke to more than 800 attendees, many of whom were Democratic donors. The fundraiser raised $1.4 million, according to a Harris campaign official, outperforming an initial goal of $400,000. The event came as part of what the campaign has dubbed a \"weekend of action,\" which comes 100 days ahead of election day.Harris is expected to select a running mate in the coming days. Her campaign has started a \"thorough\" selection process, her campaign manager told CBS News on Friday. And among the names the Harris campaign has been vetting are roughly a dozen Democrats, a source familiar with the process told CBS News last week. Multiple sources confirmed that the list included Governors Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Roy Cooper of North Carolina, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Tim Walz of Minnesota, as well as Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona. Aaron Navarro and Nidia Cavazos contributed reporting.",

HBO used the event to launch a new trailer for the show, which launches Sept. 19 on HBO and Max and received huge applause after it played to the Comic-Con crowd. The series was initially set to be a Max original but moved under the HBO umbrella — meaning it will both run on the cable channel and stream on Max — as part of a branding and strategy shift. The Penguin marks an expansion of the universe of The Batman, the 2022 hit that starred Robert Pattinson and which introduced the world to Oz Cobb, the aspiring crime boss who rises to rule the Gotham underworld as The Penguin. Farrell appeared virtually, with other panelists including Cristin Milioti (Sofia Falcone), Rhenzy Feliz (Victor Aguilar), executive producer Reeves, showrunner Lauren LeFranc and executive producer Dylan Clark. As for the future, The Batman II is on the horizon for 2026, and it’s possible there could be more TV shows set in this universe. The Penguin hails from Warner Bros. Television and DC Studios, the new arm run by James Gunn and Peter Safran. Reeves’ 6th & Idaho Productions and Dylan Clark Productions are also behind the project, which also stars Michael Kelly (Johnny Viti), Shohreh Aghdashloo (Nadia Maroni), Deirdre O’Connell (Francis Cobb), Clancy Brown (Salvatore Maroni), James Madio (Milos Grapa), Scott Cohen (Luca Falcone), Michael Zegen (Alberto Falcone), Carmen Ejogo (Eve Karlo) and Theo Rossi (Dr. Julian Rush).

In that film, “Oz” as he was called wasn’t yet the crime kingpin known as The Penguin but played a crucial role as the story delved into Gotham City’s criminal underworld. Farrell reprises his role in the HBO drama series “The Penguin,” which picks up immediately after the events of “The Batman” and follows Oz’s rise to power following the vacuum caused by Carmine Falcone’s death. The actor has said the eight-episode “The Penguin” ends right before “The Batman 2” begins, so bringing Farrell — and the character — back makes sense. This is the first confirmed casting for the “Batman” sequel outside of Pattinson. Production is due to get underway next year for an Oct. 2, 2026 release. “The Batman 2” will exist separate from the universe that new DC Studios heads James Gunn and Peter Safran are building, which kicks off in earnest with the release of Gunn’s “Superman” next summer. Originally a Max original, “The Penguin” will now debut as an HBO series on Sept. 8 of this year.",

Speaking at SDCC's The Penguin panel, Reeves shared that shooting for The Batman - Part II will begin next year and that they need to have Farrell's character in a \"certain place for that.\" We already knew The Penguin would lead into the events of The Batman - Part II, but this is the first time Farrell was 100% confirmed to make it out into the events of the sequel.

Cristin Milioti's Sofia Falcone aka The Hangman also took center stage and showed off that she may be the most dangerous character of them all. The Penguin will run for eight episodes and will make its debut on Max on September 19, 2024. As for where this series sits in the world of DC, it lives outside of the new DCU and exists in Matt Reeves' own 'Batman Epic Crime Saga.\" The Batman - Part II is set to be released in theaters on October 2, 2026, and will be the second part of a trilogy starring Robert Pattinson's Dark Knight. Alongside this trilogy, DC fans also have the DCU's own Batman film - The Brave and the Bold - to look forward to in the future. Have a tip for us? Want to discuss a possible story?

                    "text": "Former President Donald Trump blamed President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the Hezbollah rocket strike on a soccer field in northern Israel that killed 12 children and teens as he campaigned in Minnesota Saturday night. Former President Donald Trump said the attacks — which targeted the minority Druze community — “cannot be forgotten” and pointed the finger at the Biden administration. “I want to condemn the evil attack on Israel that took place today, a missile launched by Hezbollah killed at least a dozen children, young children. They were playing on a soccer field in the Golan Heights,” Trump told the crowd in St. Cloud. “Today’s attack on Israel cannot be forgotten and will go down as another moment in history created by a weak and ineffective United States President and Vice President,” Trump said. While Biden and Harris have yet to comment on the strikes, the White House National Security Council in a statement said the U.S. “will continue to support efforts to end these terrible attacks along the Blue Line, which must be a top priority. “Our support for Israel’s security is iron-clad and unwavering against all Iranian-backed terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hezbollah,” the council said. Lebanon’s government did not mention the attack specifically, but in a statement urged an “immediate cessation of hostilities on all fronts” and condemned all attacks on civilians. Meanwhile, the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called for an independent international investigation into the attacks and urged restraint. “Shocking images from the soccer field in the Druze town of Majdal Shams. I strongly condemn this bloodbath. We urge all parties to exercise utmost restraint and avoid further escalation,” he posted on X. Israel has promised to respond to the deadliest attack on the country since Hamas’ Oct. 7 massacre sparking the ongoing war in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who rushed back to Israel following his visit to the US, said he’s spoken with local leaders about the attack. “The entire nation of Israel sends its heartfelt condolences to the families of the murdered and to the entire Druze community,” he said in a statement. “Israel will not put the murderous attack on the agenda. Hezbollah will pay a heavy price for this that it has not paid so far,” he threatened. Israeli authorities said at least 30 rockets were fired from Lebanon toward Israel Saturday. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that Israel is not facing an “all out war” to its north with Hezbollah. When Israel does retaliate, Katz claims it would have the “full backing” of the United States and Europe. The Hezbollah attack came after Israeli forces carried out an airstrike in southern Lebanon about 10 miles from Majdal Shams and killed four members of the terrorist group. A Hezbollah spokesperson told the Associated Press the terror group “categorically denies carrying out an attack on Majdal Shams.” The victims, all between the ages of 10 and 20, were Druze — an ethnoreligious Arab minority that maintains Arabic as their primary language and represents just 1.6% of Israel’s population. The weekend attack could complicate another round of peace talk in Rome set to start on Sunday. CIA Director Bill Burns, Mossad Director David Barnea, the Prime Minister of Qatar and the head of Egypt’s intelligence are expected to attend.",

Israeli officials blamed Hezbollah, a Lebanese-based, Iranian-backed militant group, which denied responsibility. “Our hearts go out to the families of these innocent children,” Trump said. “No parent should have to suffer the terrible loss of a child at the hands of terrorists or anybody else. Today’s attack on Israel cannot be forgotten.” The Republican presidential nominee quickly shifted to campaign mode, blaming the man who replaced him in the White House and the woman hoping to prevent him from returning. Hezbollah “wouldn’t have done this if I were the president,” Trump said. “They wouldn’t have done that, and they didn’t. With time, the situation will only get worse for our country with the kind of leadership that we have right now, which is no leadership. It’s probably worse than no leadership. It’s negative.” Trump also moved into attacks on Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, who was dubbed the “border czar” as vice president. He called her “terrible” and “worse than [Biden] is.” “It’s a dangerous and terrible time for the world, and it’s almost the entire fault of the Biden-Harris administration,” Trump said. During his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, Trump called Harris “disrespectful to Israel.” Netanyahu, who met with all of the aforementioned U.S. politicians this week, said in a statement that Hezbollah “will pay a heavy price” for the attack. A poll released Saturday indicates that Harris is polling better against Trump than Biden was. With just over three months until the election, the vice president and the former president are within 1 percentage point of each other in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, all of which have been indicative of which candidate wins the electoral vote in recent cycles.",

                    "text": "There’s a new team coming to the MCU, and no, it’s not the Fantastic Four (although, yes, they’re inbound too). But we’re talking about “Thunderbolts,” which had some light shed on it during Marvel’s Hall H panel at San Diego Comic-Con this year. The movie reunites “Black Widow” stars Florence Pugh and David Harbor as Yelena Belova and Red Guardian respectively, and teams them up with a whole slew of Marvel returners, including Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Wyatt Russell, Sebastian Stan, Hannah John-Kamen and Olga Kurylenko, plus newcomer Geraldine Viswanathan (filling the role previously held by “The Bear” star Ayo Edebiri, who had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts caused by Hollywood’s double strike). For those unfamiliar, in the comics, the Thunderbolts team is similar to DC Comics’ Suicide Squad in that it is a team of villains completing dangerous missions for the government. In the Comic-Con-exclusive footage, which was soundtracked to “Where Is My Mind” by Pixies, Yelena is seen knocking down Red Guardian’s door — she’s there to recruit him. Plenty of action was teased, including as hallway fight with Pugh and Russell’s US Agent firing at Yelena. Ghost (John-Kamen) joins in, but they’re forced to work together because someone is trying to kill them. “Eventually you start to realize there are bad guys. And worse guys,” Pugh’s Yelena says. Ahead of the footage reveal, Harbour, Pugh, Russell, Stan and Louis-Dreyfus all took the Hall H stage, with Harbour dressed in full Red Guardian costume. In a bit, he pretended to be angry his costars didn’t get his email about dressing up. The film’s title does technically include an asterisk — it’s called “Thunderbolts*” — but when pressed as to what the asterisk means, Feige replied, “You’ll have to see the movie.” Harbour and Pugh previously worked together on “Black Widow,” and the “Stranger Things” actor had high praise for reuniting with the “Midsommar” actress. “I had one of the greatest experiences of my life working on this movie with this group of people, they’re all wonderful but I had a favorite,” he said. Pugh described the film as “so wonderful and bizarre and very brave.” “Thunderbolts” was originally slated for release this month, but filming was pushed back due to the strikes. Jake Schreier will direct the film. “Thunderbolts” is scheduled to hit theaters on July 25, 2025.",

                    "text": "Marvel's Thunderbolts will kick off the summer box office in 2025, but the cast and director Jake Schreier debuted the first footage from the film at this year's Marvel Studios panel at San Diego Comic-Con. And if the preview clips are any indication, this team may play like Marvel's Suicide Squad. The footage began with Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova reuniting with her surrogate father, Alexei Shostakov/Red Guardian (David Harbour). He's living alone in a messy apartment, and Yelena confesses that she feels an emptiness inside of her and that \"there is something wrong with me.\" Wyatt Russell's John Walker/U.S. Agent is shown at home with his child while reading a story about his downfall. Later, Yelena encounters Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) on a mission that turns out to be a trap for both of them. They're convinced that someone is trying to kill them. Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is then seen spying on Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) before cutting to his home life where he washes his metal arm in the dishwasher. The rest of the footage featured action shots of the team before finishing with a shot of the Thunderbolts in the backseat of Alexi's limo with the Red Guardian himself at the wheel. In a funny bit, Harbour came out on stage in Hall H while wearing his Red Guardian costume. Then he pretended to be disappointed that the rest of the cast did not suit up. The other cast members present were Pugh, Louis-Dreyfus, John-Kamen, Russell, Geraldine Viswanathan, and Lewis Pullman. The cast wasn't very forthcoming about the film itself, but Pugh noted that the joy of watching the Thunderbolts is that they don't play well together. But the cast had \"a real riot\" and enjoyed playing off each other. John-Kamen said that it's good to be back after Ant-Man and the Wasp, and that it will be \"interesting\" to see where Ghost is and how she's changed since we last saw her. Thunderbolts will hit theaters on May 5, 2025. Additionally, Marvel's Comic-Con panel revealed Giancarlo Esposito's role in Captain America: Brave New World, as well as that movie's connection to Eternals.",

                    "text": "We’ve long known a few things about Marvel’s Thunderbolts—or Thunderbolts*, if you’re sticking with the antihero team-up movie‘s specific punctuation. Most importantly, we knew the cast and characters, because most have already appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But we’ve yet to see this new gang together… until now. Inside Hall H during Marvel’s big panel tonight, the studio shared the first footage from the film with fans, teasing the unlikely formation of this new superteam. Crickets chirp in a wooded area with a few small homes. Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) knocks on a door and we see that it’s Alexei’s (David Harbour) place. He thinks it’s DoorDash but when he realizes it’s her, he quickly starts to clean things up. He opens the door and she says “Hi Dad.” He makes a bunch of excuses for the mess and lies about behind busy. Yelena asks them if he’s been doing well and is fulfilled. He lies and says yes. She tells him she’s there because she thinks there’s something wrong with her. She feels like she’s drifting and aimless. As she says that, we see footage of Bucky (Sebastian Stan) walking into a courtroom, and of John Walker (Wyatt Russell) reading an article about him called “Fall of a Hero.” Apparently, she’s not the only hero in the MCU who feels that way. Yelena continues talking to Alexei and says to feel better she’s been throwing herself into her work. Cut to her killing a bunch of dudes in a hallway. The Pixies’ “Where Is My Mind,” starts playing as Yelena works her way down to some secret lair, littered with computers and papers. John Walker is already down there and starts shooting at her. Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) is there with a few other characters too. A big fight starts. Lewis Pullman’s character then stumbles out in a hospital gown. Yelena asks him who sent him and he says “You were all sent?” Just then, all the doors slam shut in the room. It’s a trap. Red lights turn on with a one-minute countdown. Yelena explains that all of these characters have done bad things like robbing the government, contract kills, and more. “So?” says Walker. “Someone wants us gone,” she says. A montage begins. We see Allegra (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) walking into a party that had Marvel relics like Loki’s scepter there (at least that’s what it looked like). Pullman’s character walks out of a room and a group of soldiers stand there with guns. Yelena jumps off a building. The words “CAREFUL WHO YOU ASSEMBLE” pop on the screen. We see the group from earlier all together in an elevator, then entering Allegra’s office. “There are good guys, and you’re bad guys,” she says. A few more action shots flip by, ending with Allegra saying, “But there are worse guys.” After the title, Thunderbolts* (emphasis on the asterix), we see a red limousine driving in the desert. The group is in there and Alexei is driving. “This has the making of a team that can raise to glory,” he says. “That can be the heroes on the Wheaties box.” (Yelena interrupts: “I find it’s best if you ignore him.”) “With a little kiddie toy,” he adds. Roll call! That’s Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, Hannah John-Kamen as Ava Starr/Ghost, Wyatt Russell as John Walker/U.S. Agent, Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, David Harbour as Alexei Shostakov/Red Guardian, Olga Kurylenko as Antonia Dreykov/Taskmaster, Lewis Pullman as the Sentry, and Harrison Ford as Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross. And that’s not even everyone appearing in this MCU smorgasbord! Jake Schreier (Robot & Frank, Paper Towns) directs what looks to be a fun onslaught of action; it’ll rampage into theaters May 5, 2025.

                    "text": "Theatrics are always welcome in any Marvel Hall H panel and David Harbour showed up Saturday night dressed as his Russian character Alexi Shostakov. “Oh my God! You guys didn’t dress up!” said Harbour standing in the middle of Hall H. “Guys I sent the email! Because we said it was Comic-Con!” “Sebastian! You said because I couldn’t rewrite that pivotal monologue in act 2, that you’d dress up!” “Nobody dressed up except Julia (Louis Dreyfus)! Thank you, Julia…Guys I’m so embarrassed!” RELATED: Marvel At Comic-Con 2024: Red Carpet, Panel Photos & More During its packed Hall H panel at Comic-Con on Saturday, Marvel Studios rolled out the first footage from Thunderbolts*, its superhero film set to close out Phase Five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In the trailer, Florence Pugh’s Yelena returns home to Alexi. He says he’s been busy, but he’s been busy being a coach potatoe. She says she’s been unfulfilled, losing herself in work of contract kills. She’s called into a lab where she meets the Thunderbolts team, all of whom try to kill her. “Somone wants us gone,” says Pugh. There’s a shot of Louis-Dreyfus’ Valentina at a high-class, fancy dinner soiree, as Sebastian Stan’s Bucky looks on. Dark-hued action which looks very different from other superhero movies and a trippy scene where Yelena jumps off a skyscraper. The tag-line “Careful Who You Assemble”. The film was concevied as the MCU’s answer to Suicide Squad. Derived from characters first introduced to Marvel Comics in 1997, the story is expected to follow a group of villains as they’re sent on missions commissions by the government. Thunderbolts* was first announced at Comic-Con 2022, with many of the core cast members being introduced on stage at Disney’s D23 event in 2023. The ensemble includes Harrison Ford as Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, Sebastian Stan as Winter Soldier, David Harbour as Red Guardian, Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, Wyatt Russell as U.S. Agent John Walker, Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost, Olga Kurylenko as Taskmaster, Lewis Pullman as Sentry, and Geraldine Viswanathan, among others. Jake Schreier directed the Marvel tentpole from a script by his Beef collaborator Lee Sung Jin, with Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige producing the pic slated for release on May 5, 2025. Today’s news comes at a time when Marvel has begun recalibrating, lifting the pressure to produce as much content as possible with a new mandate of two films per year. Already past the release of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and The Marvels, with Deadpool & Wolverine currently in theaters, its fifth phase of the MCU is also set to feature Captain America: Brave New World, which opens on February 14, 2025. Opening with The Fantastic Four on July 25, 2025, Phase Six will also feature Blade (November 7, 2025), Avengers 5 (May 1, 2026), and Avengers: Secret Wars (May 7, 2027). This year’s edition of San Diego Comic-Con runs through Sunday. DEADLINE RELATED VIDEO",

                    "text": "Hi, friends! Welcome to Installer No. 47, your guide to the best and Verge-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, so psyched you found us, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.) This week, I’ve been reading about Skibidi Toilet and the future of mall brands and the legacy of Bell Labs, watching Dirty Pop and catching up on Cobra Kai, downloading every single podcast episode mentioned in this excellent Reddit thread, writing stuff down with Napkin, and trying desperately to figure out what I forgot to pack for vacation. I’ve also been trying new blueberry muffin recipes all week — thanks to everyone who sent me one! Speaking of which: As I mentioned last week, Installer is taking a summer break. I’m going to go sit outside and stare at trees for a couple of weeks. (If you have good fun books I should read, by the way, please send them my way.) I’ll be back here August 17th with a big catch-up Installer, but I hope you have a great couple of weeks, and keep telling me about everything you’re into! Before I go, I also have for you a new way to use Apple Maps, an interesting interview with Mark Zuckerberg, the best way to watch the Olympics, some of the internet’s best and silliest websites, and much more. Let’s do it. (As always, the best part of Installer is your ideas and tips. What are you into right now? What should everyone else be reading, watching, playing, snacking on, or listening to? Tell me everything: installer@theverge.com. And if you know someone else who might enjoy Installer, tell them to subscribe here.) --- The Drop * Peacock’s Olympics Multiview. Peacock is doing ~ the most ~ for the Olympics this year. Personalized highlights! AI Al Michaels! The Gold Zone! But I’ll be spending the next two weeks locked to the Multiview. Four events at a time, and I get to pick which one gets the audio? That’s the future of TV right there. * The Asus ROG Ally X. A Windows gaming handheld that is fast, comfortable, and quiet? That’s the dream right there. Except Windows still stinks on the tiny screen, and $800 is a lot for this thing. But still! We’re making progress! * Apple Maps for web. Apple’s new beta Maps tool is a stark, simple, lovely contrast to the cluttered mess of Google Maps. It’ll be interesting to see how much Apple tries to do here — Maps is great for navigation but rough for place discovery, but maybe this is a sign Apple wants to fix that. * Capacities. I’ve been messing with this superpowerful note-taking app for a while, and I really like the way Capacities organizes things. Now there’s a mobile app, too, which makes it much easier to get stuff into the system. It’s definitely a power-user tool, but I’m liking it a lot. * “Inside Mark Zuckerberg’s AI Era.” A long, unusually thoughtful interview with Mark Zuckerberg, in which Zuck has a very funny tan but also some really interesting thoughts on AI, AR, and how we think about the real world and the internet going forward. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed watching this. * Llama 3.1. The occasion for that Zuckerberg interview was the launch of Meta’s new AI model, which is apparently better and faster in the way that every new model now is the best and fastest. But the combination of the open-source approach here, and Meta’s shockingly popular Meta AI bot, means Llama is legit one to watch. * The Elgato Stream Deck XLR Dock. If you use an external mic for video calls, streaming, podcasting, whatever, this dock / Stream Deck combo might be the best simple USB setup I’ve ever seen. I bought one immediately. * Deadpool & Wolverine. Right now, it looks like Twisters might be the movie of the summer. I’m a little nervous about this one, which has been so hyped and overexposed, but I still have high hopes for two of my favorite Marvel characters. * “How sci-fi has changed over the last 70 years, analyzed with data.” You should really read and watch everything The Pudding does. But this one feels particularly Installer-y — an analysis of hundreds of sci-fi flicks to try and figure out how we think about the future, the obstacles we think we’ll have to overcome, and more. The main modern villain? Society. * The Tiny Awards. An annual competition for the best of the “personal internet,” which doubles as just a long list of really fun, often silly, always delightful websites. Infinite Craft, which I’ve mentioned here before, is just one of this year’s great nominees. --- Screen share Even if you don’t know Josh Rubin, there’s a good chance you know That Vision Pro Photo. The one with the guy in the impossibly cool hoodie, making the Vision Pro look like an extremely futuristic piece of streetwear and not a silly giant headset? Yeah, that was Josh Rubin. When he’s not looking like a gadget model, Josh is the co-founder of Cool Hunting, a long-running compendium of just deeply awesome stuff. I’ve been a reader forever, so when Josh posted his homescreen running the new and much more customizable iOS 18 beta, I immediately reached out and told him he needed to share with the rest of us. Here’s Josh’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why: [Image: https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nLY1vkORHIeaQM6wXMn1tdCSLOo=/0x0:2580x2796/2580x2796/filters:focal(1290x1398:1291x1399)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25547279/Josh_Rubin_homescreen.jpg] The phone: iPhone 15 Pro Max, Titanium, no case. The wallpaper: I keep my homescreen wallpaper black, as I find most wallpapers are too visually distracting and disharmonious with the app icons. The apps: Settings, App Store, Safari, Notion, Todoist, Perplexity, Phone, Messages, Edison Mail. With the iOS 18 beta, I’m so happy to finally have more control over app and widget layout. For my first two screens, I’m balancing utility and aesthetics, which is kind of a life philosophy, to be honest. The dock holds phone, messages, and email, which are obvious. I’m a photographer and often use the native iPhone camera app, though there are many others I use in different cases, so the last dock item is a folder of camera and photo editing apps. On screen one, the vertical column of widgets are each stacks for quickly glancing info I need regularly, and the right column of apps are the ones I tend to use most often. Screen two is optimized for right-handed use, with the apps and folders all within thumb’s reach and one widget stack glanceable in the upper-left corner; there’s a color harmony that’s considered as well. Some notes on the apps and widget stacks of note: Screen One: The first widget stack is showing Hello Weather, which uses the Apple Weather (RIP Dark Sky) data and has great widget options. Also in that stack are Ventusky, Weather Strip, and Lumy because often the best way to visualize weather info is actually weather-dependent. The second stack is Fantastical and includes the month views shown as well as a day view and up-next view. Also in there is my next flight info via Flighty (I travel a lot). Last stack is Google Search and Google Maps. Notion is essential for notes and project status tracking. I’m using Perplexity to research stuff more than Google these days and love that, of all the AI tools out there, they attribute their info to linked pages, which makes fact-checking easy. Screen Two: The widget is my Oura sleep data, which is there more because I like the way it looks. Also in that stack are Apple Fitness activity rings and Apple Health vitals. Retro is a clean, simple, basic photo sharing app that I use with friends only. It’s reminiscent of the earliest days of Instagram. I also asked Josh to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he shared: * I’m not a gamer at all, but ever since trying Blackbox on Vision Pro, I’ve been loving how it blends art and play. * I just made Hashi (chopsticks) in a workshop with Seral Wood and Steel at the SingleThread farm shop and am suddenly enamored with woodworking. * Snoopy. Have been obsessed forever and love that Peanuts-related stuff is on the rise. --- Crowdsourced Here’s what the Installer community is into this week.

I really want to know. I am a constant list-maker, and I find everything about life easier when I’m writing stuff down, but for some reason, I’ve never seen the point of a packing list. In fairness, my packing strategy is just to shove a bunch of stuff into however big a suitcase I happen to have, and then either only need a quarter of what I packed or somehow forget six really important things. Sometimes both! But then I look at lists like this one, and I’m like, do I really need to write down “bring underwear”? And do people really pack duct tape every time they travel? I don’t travel as much as I used to, so maybe I’m not life-hacking it hard enough anymore. I will tell you this, though: my flight’s only two hours, but I’ve already downloaded about 85 hours worth of stuff to watch. So I’ll at least have one part of the trip covered. See you in a few weeks!",

                    "text": "MARSEILLE – The U.S. women’s soccer team is off to a fast start at the 2024 Olympics, having defeated Zambia, 3-0, on July 25. They play again today – Sunday, July 28 – against Germany. The game kicks off at 2:45 p.m. Eastern on USA Network and Peacock. Fans who have parted ways with their local cable provider can catch this game for free by utilizing streaming alternatives like FuboTV and DirecTV Stream, which both offer a free trial. Sling TV is also offering promotional discounts for new customers.

Trinity Rodman scored first for the United States against Zambia on Thursday, then Mallory Swanson added two goals just seconds apart as the Americans jumped out to a 3-0 lead on Zambia. It was a lead they held for the remainder. On the other side, Germany defeated Australia 3-0 in the other Group B matchup, setting up a showdown between the two talented squads for Sunday. Both teams have goal differentials of plus-three headed into a critical second matchup.

Trinity Rodman also scored for the United States, which is looking to add a record fifth gold medal to its Olympic collection. Zambia was hurt in the 33rd minute when Pauline Zulu was sent off with a red card and the team was limited to 10 players the rest of the way. Zulu sobbed as she left the field. Hayes took over the U.S. team in late May after finishing out the season with Chelsea in the Women’s Super League. She shook things up a bit with her roster, leaving star forward Alex Morgan, a veteran of three Olympics, at home. Hayes is charged with leading the Americans as they seek to distance themselves from the disappointment of last summer’s Women’s World Cup, when they crashed out in the round of 16. “If you had asked me at the beginning of the game, ‘Would you be happy with a 3-nil win?’ I probably would have said no,” Hayes said. “However, after the performance and the chances created and finding the back of the net we did, I don’t want to be too hard on the girls.” Rodman, making her Olympic debut, scored in the 17th minute. U.S. captain Lindsey Horan passed to Rodman, who deftly shot around onrushing Zambian goalkeeper Ngambo Musole. Swanson scored twice within 70 seconds in the 24th and 25th minutes to give the Americans a 3-0 lead in the Group B match in Nice. Swanson called it just a start. “I think there’s little things within that game, within the play, that we need to fine-tune, that we can just keep on growing with,” Swanson said. “So I think there’s definitely those little things, and we’ll address them and fix them and keep moving forward.” U.S. forward Sophia Smith left the game with what appeared to be an ankle injury late in the first half and was replaced by Lynn Williams. Williams was originally an alternate on Hayes’ Olympic roster, but Catarina Macario wasn’t able to play in France because of minor knee irritation. It was the first time the United States has faced Zambia on the international stage. “A lot of credit to Zambia’s goalkeeper tonight, because in the first half I think we had a sequence of like six shots in a row that she saved or went off the post,” Horan said. “And sometimes that how it goes. I was really happy it wasn’t one of those days where the ball just doesn’t go in the back of the net.” While Zambia started stars Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji, neither of them was able to break through the U.S. defense, which was stout throughout the match. Banda is a proven scorer, with 12 goals in 12 games this season for the Orlando Pride in the National Women’s Soccer League. At the Tokyo Games, she had a pair of back-to-back hat tricks in the group stage. The United States will next face Germany on Sunday in Marseille.",

                    "text": "Joe and Anthony Russo, the brother directing duo behind Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame, haven’t finished their work in the Marvel Cinematic Universe just yet. Marvel Studios announced at its 2024 San Diego Comic-Con panel on Saturday night that the Russos would come out of short superhero-movie retirement to direct back-to-back Avengers movies: Avengers: Doomsday, which hits theaters on May 1, 2026, and Avengers: Secret Wars, which arrives two years later on May 7, 2027. The revelation that Avengers 5 (previously known as Avengers: The Kang Dynasty) is now known as Avengers: Doomsday is certainly a big hint about who’s going to be the villain in that film: Doctor Doom. And the actor who will be portraying Doom is none other than Robert Downey, Jr. himself. Yep, Iron Man is getting back into the — or, rather, a metal suit. “New mask, same task,” Downey said at Marvel’s Hall H panel on Saturday. But Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige also offered a hint about who else is going to appear in those Avengers movies. The casts of Captain America: Brave New World, Thunderbolts*, and Fantastic Four: First Steps will all appear in the Avengers sequels, Feige said. Between directing and producing through their company AGBO, the Russos have kept busy since departing the MCU — often on projects that involve their cast members from Avengers: Endgame. In 2020, Joe Russo wrote the Chris Hemsworth-led action flick Extraction for stuntman and longtime Marvel second-unit director Sam Hargrave. Two years later, the brothers had perhaps their greatest victory lap: producing Everything Everywhere All at Once, and shepherding the movie to Best Picture Oscar glory. The Russos weren’t as successful on the directing front, at least as far as reviews were concerned. 2021 saw the brothers make a prestige play with a malianged adaptation of the drug-fueled crime saga Cherry, with Tom Holland, followed by the equally rejected Netflix blockbuster The Grey Man in 2022. Directing and producing Amazon’s mega-budgeted spy show Citadel didn’t go so well either. They currently have another film in the can: the sci-fi tentpole The Electric State starring Chris Pratt and Millie Bobby Brown. At a 2019 SDCC panel/Endgame victory lap, the Russos teased some major projects that still haven’t come to fruition: a live-action adaptation of Battle of the Planets; an animated series based on the Grimjack comic series; and a Magic: The Gathering series for Netflix. In the same breath, they addressed whether they would ever come back to direct another Marvel movie. They told people not to hold their breaths... unless maybe the project was Secret Wars, which they could never dream of happening in a million years. Well, what do you know.

(but gotta imagine we meet in Fantastic Four first) #SDCC pic.twitter.com/maMooLWenN— Eric Goldman (@TheEricGoldman) July 28, 2024 So, as it stands, The Russo Brothers will be directing both Avengers: Doomsday for May 2026 and Avengers: Secret Wars, and Downey Jr. will be leading the charge, but this time as a villain. The fifth Avengers film was originally supposed to be directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, who previously served as a director for the MCU film Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. However, Cretton stepped down from the role a year later, citing a desire to focus on other MCU projects, such as a sequel to Shang-Chi. Avengers: Doomsday was originally called The Kang Dynasty when unveiled back at SDCC 2022. However, the film took a drastic pivot after Kang the Conquerer actor Jonathan Majors was fired from the MCU following his conviction in his domestic violence trial last year.

                    "text": "The filmmakers behind Marvel's most profitable movie are coming back to the Hollywood superhero giant. Following earlier reports that Joe and Anthony Russo were in early talks to direct Avengers 5 and 6, Marvel Studios confirmed during their splashy Hall H panel at Comic-Con Saturday night that the brotherly duo is officially returning. Not only that, but the fifth Avengers film has been rebranded from Avengers: The Kang Dynasty to Avengers: Doomsday, featuring Iron Man actor Robert Downey, Jr.'s return to Marvel to play classic comic book villain Doctor Doom. Marvel President Kevin Feige first teased the news at the end of the panel, saying, \"Who the heck is going to direct these two movies?\" He then screened footage from the Russos' past work before the filmmaking duo came out on stage. \"We missed you guys,\" Joe Russo began. \"You are the best damn fans in the world.\" \"That four-movie run was incredible, and it left us creatively spent with all our emotions on the floor,\" Anthony said. \"In the time since, through a very special story, Joe and I have come to potentially see a road forward with you all.\" The Russos got their start at Marvel directing Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) before going on to direct the sequel, Captain America: Civil War (2016), and two Avengers movies, Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019). The latter is the second highest-grossing film of all time, with a lifetime gross of $2.8 billion. Avengers 5 was initially announced as Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, set for release in 2026, and Avengers 6 was dubbed Avengers: Secret Wars, after the famous Marvel comic book arc, and set for release in 2027. However, Marvel fired Jonathan Majors, who was set to star as Kang, the pivotal big bad for this next phase of movies and shows, following the actor's guilty verdict in his assault trial. Marvel has now shifted the main villain for the next two Avengers films to Doctor Doom. Marvel Comics released Secret Wars as a miniseries event in the 1980s. In it, a figure called the Beyonder transports groups of classic superheroes and villains to a planet called Battleworld, one giant arena in which the Beyonder compels them to do battle to determine whether good or evil will triumph. Secret Wars is also the name of a more recent comic book arc launched in 2015. In it, different realities of the Marvel multiverse were destroyed and combined to form Battleworld, bringing various heroes from all those dimensions together. Avengers: Doomsday will open in theaters in May 2026, while Avengers: Secret Wars hits May 2027. There's been a lot of talk of superhero fatigue in the press, given the lower box office returns for recent MCU titles, including Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and The Marvels. The Russos are tried and true hitmakers when it comes to return on investment. Deadpool & Wolverine director Shawn Levy, who was also reportedly in early talks for the Avengers gig, previously commented to Entertainment Weekly, \"Marvel had some misses,\" but added, \"People are way too quick to declare the last rites of the superhero genre. I don't buy into that fatigue narrative.\" Want more movie news? Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free newsletter to get the latest trailers, celebrity interviews, film reviews, and more. Levy's film, which earned record-breaking early ticket sales ahead of its debut in theaters on July 26, was also celebrated at Comic-Con. Marvel revealed the A-listers making splashy cameos in the film by rolling them out on stage. The main Hall H panel on Saturday also previewed Captain America: Brave New World (Feb. 14, 2025), Thunderbolts (May 2, 2025), and The Fantastic Four (July 25, 2025).",

                    "text": "“Avengers: The Kang Dynasty” has been retitled with a full-tilt pivot. The next Avengers films will be “Avengers: Doomsday” and “Avengers: Secret Wars” and they will both be directed by the Russo Brothers. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo are uniting with Marvel Studios once again to helm the next superhero team-up feature. On Saturday evening, they made their return official by taking the stage at San Diego Comic-Con’s Hall H to thunderous applause. “When we directed ‘Avengers: Endgame,’ we really believed it was the end for us in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,” said Joe Russo to the crowd. “That four-movie run was incredible, and it left us creatively spent.” However, in the time since, the duo found a “very special story” that convinced them to come back. In fact, “it’s the biggest story that Marvel comics ever told. It’s the reason that Anthony and I are standing up here.” And that film is “Avengers: Secret Wars.” But to build towards the epic battle that is “Secret Wars” the story would need the kind of very important character that is “required” to do “Secret Wars” justice. So, enter Doomsday to be played by Robert Downey Jr., the man who helped put the MCU on the map with his devilish turn as Iron Man/Tony Stark. The first film is titled “Avengers: Doomsday” and will premiere in May 2026 with “Avengers: Secret Wars” following in May 2027. The Russo brothers step in for Destin Daniel Cretton, who left the movie in November 2023 to focus on other Marvel projects on his docket, including a prospective sequel to his 2021 film “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.” Michael Waldron, who created Marvel’s Disney+ series “Loki,” is writing the script to this “Avengers” film and the follow-up, “Avengers: Secret Wars,” which is intended to be the “Endgame”-style conclusion to what studio chief Kevin Feige dubbed the Multiverse Saga in 2022. The Russo brothers are far from strangers to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. They previously directed the two most recent “Avengers” movies, “Infinity War” and “Endgame,” and two “Captain America” movies, “The Winter Soldier” and “Civil War.” After making the “Avengers” movies, which both earned more than $2 billion at the box office, the Russos left Marvel to direct “Cherry,” a gritty crime drama that starred Tom Holland, Netflix’s “The Gray Man,” an action-thriller with Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans, and the streamer’s upcoming film “The Electric State.” Many observers felt the decision to retitle “The Kang Dynasty” was inevitable after Jonathan Majors — the actor who’d been playing the titular Marvel supervillain Kang for two years — was convicted in December of misdemeanor assault and harassment of his now ex-girlfriend. The studio parted ways with the actor less than two hours after the verdict was announced, capping nearly a year of uncertainty about Majors’ future with Marvel following his arrest in March. But the studio has remained quiet about whether losing Majors also meant saying goodbye to the character of Kang. Majors portrayed Kang several times, including on the first and second seasons of “Loki,” and as the main villain in 2023’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.” In the mid-credits scene of that movie, Majors even appears as an army of Kang variants; taking over all of those performances would be a tall order for any new actor. More importantly, audiences haven’t exactly embraced Kang as a character, or the multiverse as a storytelling engine, in the same way that Thanos and the Infinity Saga served as sturdy narrative spines in the 2010’s. The Season 2 finale of “Loki” tied off Kang’s storyline so that Marvel could move on without unduly disrupting their wider plans for the Multiverse Saga. With this new title, that appears to be exactly what the studio is doing.",

                    "text": "Tom Cruise was not the star of the show at the Bercy Arena in Paris on July 28, but the actor still drew a lot of attention as he watched Simone Biles and the U.S. women's gymnastics team compete. Cruise has been in Paris for the first few days of the 2024 Summer Olympics, and was first spotted at the opening ceremony along the Seine river on July 26.

                    "title": "Could a Strike from Lebanon Trigger a War between Israel and Hezbollah after 12 Youths were Killed?",
                    "text": "TEL AVIV – The Middle East was bracing for a potential flare-up in violence on Sunday after Israeli authorities said a rocket from Lebanon struck a soccer field in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights killing, 12 children and teens in what the military said was the deadliest attack on civilians since Oct. 7. The strike raised fears of a broader regional war between Israel and Hezbollah, which denied a role in the attack. Overnight, the Israeli military said it struck a number of targets inside Lebanon, though the intensity of the strikes was similar to months of cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Saturday’s attack comes at a sensitive time, as Israel and Hamas are negotiating a cease-fire proposal to end the nearly 10-month war in Gaza and free the roughly 110 hostages who remain captive there. Here is a look at the broader repercussions of Saturday’s attack: What happened? On Saturday just before sunset, a rocket slammed into a soccer pitch where dozens of children and teens were playing in the Druze town of Majdal Shams, which is located about 12 kilometers (7 miles) south of Lebanon and next to the Syrian border. Twelve young people between the ages of 10 and 20 were killed, and 20 were wounded, according to the Israeli military. “I feel darkness inside and out. Nothing like this happened here,” Anan Abu Saleh, a Majdal Shams resident, said from the soccer field on Saturday night. “There’s no way to explain this. I saw children, I don’t want to say what I saw, but its horrible, really horrible. We need more security.” Shrapnel and spatters of blood pockmarked the field as emergency workers collected burned backpacks and bicycles. Overnight, residents began setting up hundreds of chairs on the field where the attack took place to hold a mass memorial. Residents told Israeli media it was the only place in the town that would be able to hold the tens of thousands of people expected to gather. On Sunday morning, many of the bodies were brought to a community center in Majdal Shams, where family members wailed over the coffins. At midday, the coffins, draped in white cloth and bearing photos of the victims, were brought to the cemetery, passed through a crowd of thousands and lined up for burial. One 11-year-old child is still missing, residents told Israeli media. Who are the Druze? The Druze are a religious sect that began as an offshoot of Shiite Islam. There are Druze communities in Israel, Syria, and Lebanon. There are about 140,000 Druze in Israel, 25,000 of whom live in four towns in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, according to Yusri Hazran of the Hebrew University, who is Druze and researches minorities in the Middle East. The Druze community is considered among Israel’s most loyal citizens. Many Druze serve in the Israeli military, although those living in the Golan Heights have a more fraught relationship with the authorities. Israel captured and annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Much of the international community considers the area to be occupied territory. While Druze leaders in the Golan still profess allegiance to Syria, relations with Israel are normally good. The Druze towns in the Golan are a popular vacation destination for Israelis and are filled with hotels and restaurants, and most Druze residents speak Hebrew fluently. What could this mean for Lebanon and for a wider war? The attacks on the Israel-Lebanon border have simmered just below the threshold of an all-out war since the start of the conflict in October. But the deadly toll of the attack, and the young age of the victims, could push Israel to respond more severely. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel the day after Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7, and Israel has responded by targeting what it says is Hezbollah military infrastructure with airstrikes and drones. Most of the attacks have been confined to the area on either side of the border, though Israel has also assassinated Hezbollah and Hamas leadership farther north in Lebanon. Tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border have evacuated the area. Since early October, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed more than 500 people, mostly Hezbollah members, but also around 90 civilians. On the Israeli side, 22 soldiers and 24 civilians have been killed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was in America at the time of the strike, warned that Hezbollah “will pay a heavy price for this attack, one that it has not paid so far.” The Israeli military’s Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi met with leaders of Majdal Shams on Saturday night, and said Israel was preparing for “the next stage of fighting” in the north. “We know how to strike even very far from the state of Israel,” he said. In a rare move, Hezbollah denied it was responsible for the attack, but Halevi said the rocket was a Falaq rocket with a 53-kilogram warhead that belonged to the Hezbollah. U.S. intelligence officials have no doubts that Hezbollah carried out the attack on the Golan Heights, but it was not clear if the militant group intended the target or misfired, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to comment publicly. Lebanon’s government, in a statement that didn’t mention Majdal Shams, urged an “immediate cessation of hostilities on all fronts” and condemned all attacks on civilians. Iran on Sunday warned Israel that a strong reaction to the Golan Heights strike will lead to “unprecedented consequences.” “Any unwise action by the Zionist regime is a ground-paving for expansion of instability, insecurity and war in the region,” said Nasser Kanaani, the spokesman for the Iranian foreign ministry. Iran and Israel’s yearslong shadow war burst into the open in April, when Iran launched 300 missiles and drones at Israel, most of which were intercepted, in response to the killing of an Iranian general. How could this impact the war in Gaza? He said mediators will use such an attack to press for a cease-fire in Gaza to avoid an all-out war in the region. “Both fronts are connected,” he said. “A cease-fire in Gaza will lead to a cease-fire with Hezbollah.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the sensitive talks with the media.

                    "text": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The Middle East was bracing for a potential flare-up in violence on Sunday after Israeli authorities said a rocket from Lebanon struck a soccer field in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, killing 12 children and teens in what the military said was the deadliest attack on civilians since Oct. 7. The strike raised fears of a broader regional war between Israel and Hezbollah, which denied a role in the attack. Overnight, the Israeli military said it struck a number of targets inside Lebanon, though the intensity of the strikes was similar to months of cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Saturday’s attack comes at a sensitive time, as Israel and Hamas are negotiating a cease-fire proposal to end the nearly 10-month war in Gaza and free the roughly 110 hostages who remain captive there. Here is a look at the broader repercussions of Saturday’s attack: What happened?On Saturday just before sunset, a rocket slammed into a soccer pitch where dozens of children and teens were playing in the Druze town of Majdal Shams, which is located about 12 kilometers (7 miles) south of Lebanon and next to the Syrian border. Twelve young people between the ages of 10 and 20 were killed, and 20 were wounded, according to the Israeli military. “I feel darkness inside and out. Nothing like this happened here,” Anan Abu Saleh, a Majdal Shams resident, said from the soccer field on Saturday night. “There’s no way to explain this. I saw children, I don’t want to say what I saw, but its horrible, really horrible. We need more security.” Shrapnel and spatters of blood pockmarked the field as emergency workers collected burned backpacks and bicycles. Overnight, residents began setting up hundreds of chairs on the field where the attack took place to hold a mass memorial. Residents told Israeli media it was the only place in the town that would be able to hold the tens of thousands of people expected to gather. On Sunday morning, many of the bodies were brought to a community center in Majdal Shams, where family members wailed over the coffins. At midday, the coffins, draped in white cloth and bearing photos of the victims, were brought to the cemetery, passed through a crowd of thousands and lined up for burial. One 11-year-old child is still missing, residents told Israeli media. Who are the Druze?The Druze are a religious sect that began as an offshoot of Shiite Islam. There are Druze communities in Israel, Syria, and Lebanon. There are about 140,000 Druze in Israel, 25,000 of whom live in four towns in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, according to Yusri Hazran of the Hebrew University, who is Druze and researches minorities in the Middle East. The Druze community is considered among Israel’s most loyal citizens. Many Druze serve in the Israeli military, although those living in the Golan Heights have a more fraught relationship with the authorities. Israel captured the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war, and annexed it in 1981. Much of the international community considers the area to be occupied territory. While Druze leaders in the Golan still profess allegiance to Syria, relations with Israel are normally good. The Druze towns in the Golan are a popular vacation destination for Israelis and are filled with hotels and restaurants, and most Druze residents speak Hebrew fluently. What could this mean for Lebanon and for a wider war?The attacks on the Israel-Lebanon border have simmered just below the threshold of an all-out war since the start of the conflict in October. But the deadly toll of the attack, and the young age of the victims, could push Israel to respond more severely. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel the day after Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7, and Israel has responded by targeting what it says is Hezbollah military infrastructure with airstrikes and drones. Most of the attacks have been confined to the area on either side of the border, though Israel has also assassinated Hezbollah and Hamas leadership farther north in Lebanon. Tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border have evacuated the area. Since early October, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed more than 500 people, mostly Hezbollah members, but also around 90 civilians. On the Israeli side, 22 soldiers and 24 civilians have been killed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was in America at the time of the strike, warned that Hezbollah “will pay a heavy price for this attack, one that it has not paid so far.” The Israeli military’s Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi met with leaders of Majdal Shams on Saturday night, and said Israel was preparing for “the next stage of fighting” in the north. “We know how to strike even very far from the state of Israel,” he said. In a rare move, Hezbollah denied it was responsible for the attack, but Halevi said the rocket was a Falaq rocket with a 53-kilogram warhead that belonged to Hezbollah. U.S. intelligence officials have no doubts that Hezbollah carried out the attack on the Golan Heights, but it was not clear if the militant group intended the target or misfired, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to comment publicly. Lebanon’s government, in a statement that didn’t mention Majdal Shams, urged an “immediate cessation of hostilities on all fronts” and condemned all attacks on civilians. Iran on Sunday warned Israel that a strong reaction to the Golan Heights strike will lead to “unprecedented consequences.” “Any unwise action by the Zionist regime is a ground-paving for expansion of instability, insecurity and war in the region,” said Nasser Kanaani, the spokesman for the Iranian foreign ministry. Iran and Israel’s yearslong shadow war burst into the open in April, when Iran launched 300 missiles and drones at Israel, most of which were intercepted, in response to the killing of an Iranian general. How could this impact the war in Gaza?An Egyptian official said the attack in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights could give urgency to the negotiations to reach a cease-fire deal in Gaza, which would be reflected on the Israeli-Hezbollah front. He said mediators will use such an attack to press for a cease-fire in Gaza to avoid an all-out war in the region. “Both fronts are connected,” he said. “A cease-fire in Gaza will lead to a cease-fire with Hezbollah.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the sensitive talks with the media. Officials from the United States, Egypt and Qatar are meeting Sunday with Israeli officials in Rome in the latest push for a cease-fire deal in Gaza.",

                    "title": "Mayor suggests there are two perspectives as new video of Manchester airport incident fuels fears of escalating tensions",
                    "text": "Concerns are growing that the situation in Manchester could escalate following the emergence of new footage depicting a violent altercation at the airport involving a police officer kicking a young man in the head. It comes as Andy Burnham, Manchester mayor, has insisted there are “two sides” to the “complicated” situation. The original footage, filmed at Manchester airport on Tuesday last week, captured a policeman stamping on the head of 19-year-old Mohammed Fahir. It quickly went viral and sparked outrage without any context of the moments leading up to the teen’s violent arrest. On Saturday evening new video surfaced of a brutal assault on the three police officers captured in the first clip. The video captured a man repeatedly punching an officer as he sat back in a chair, while another individual struck a female officer in the face, causing her to fall to the ground. While the new footage may have shed more light on what happened at the airport, unanswered questions about the incident remain. At least 100 people swarmed outside Rochdale police station in protest on Thursday night after watching the footage online. Roads and tram lines in the city centre were blocked as a result of the unrest. Neil Emmott, the leader of Rochdale borough council, expressed to The Guardian: “There were definitely moments when there was a fear that the situation might spiral out of control – we can’t ignore that reality.” Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham told MEN that he is asking people “not to rush to judgement” over the violent videos. “This is a complicated situation with two sides to it. It is why I urged people not to rush to judgement,” he said. At the beginning of the video a group of people can be seen milling around a ticket machine in Terminal 2, as three cops including two women and a man head towards them. One of the officers goes to grab the hands of a man who is facing the ticket machine to restrain him, in video obtained by MEN. It appears to be Fahir, the same man whose head is stamped on by a male police officer in the original clip. As he resists the three police try to gain control of the situation, which is when a second man gets involved and lunges for the male cop. This man, in a grey t-shirt, can be seen hitting the male cop in the face a whopping six times before the officer tasers him and is able to back away. Around the same time the man who appears to be Fahir seems to hit a female officer in the face repeatedly until she falls to the ground. Chaos erupts in the airport terminal as the three officers struggle to fend off the group from all sides. The force said on Wednesday evening that people are “rightly extremely concerned” over the clip and that a male officer involved had been removed from duty. Burnham previously told BBC Radio 4 the situation is “not clear cut” after outbursts followed the video online. He said: “Last night I’d seen the partial footage like everybody. “And my reaction was similar to most people’s in communities. “What I’ve had the chance to do since is look at the whole incident and what I would say is it’s not a clear cut situation. It’s a fast moving situation that escalates.” He added: “These are disturbing images and the right action has been taken by Greater Manchester Police. Which is to refer the matter to the IOPC and suspend the officer concerned.” Fahir’s family have also called for calm following days of unrest in Manchester, as people swarmed Rochdale police station in protest. Their lawyer told BBC Radio 4: “The family also wanted me to make crystal clear [that] they’ve got no political agenda. They do not condone political violence and they do not want to take part in any protests. “And they wanted me to appeal for calm on their behalf. And I hope that appeal is heeded not just in Rochdale, but in Manchester as well.” Fahir has a cyst on his brain with symptoms “worsening overnight”, his family lawyer revealed on Thursday. GMP explained more about the video in a statement last week, writing: “In advance of what is shown in the footage available, we were called to reports of an assault at Terminal 2, Manchester Airport at 8.25pm on Tuesday 23 July. “The alleged suspect was seen on CCTV at a ticket machine in the car park and officers attended the location to arrest him.” “During our response, three officers were assaulted,” they told the public. The statement read: “One female officer suffered a broken nose and the other officers were forced to the ground and suffered injuries which required hospital treatment.”",

                    "text": "The mayor of Greater Manchester urged people “not to rush to judgment” over the Manchester Airport incident after new footage appears to show a violent and frenetic lead-up. Protests erupted in Rochdale and Manchester city centre after a video circulated of an officer allegedly kicking and stamping on a man as he lay face-down during an arrest at the airport on Tuesday. A Greater Manchester Police constable has been advised he is under criminal investigation for assault over the incident, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said on Friday. On Saturday, Manchester Evening News published new footage believed to be of the preceding events. The video appears to show a group of people standing by ticket machines in Terminal Two (T2) and a man in a light blue outfit is facing one of the machines. It appears three officers approach him from behind and try to restrain him, with a male officer seemingly pushing his head down. Another man, wearing a dark t-shirt, appears to grab the male officer and the two start to throw punches at one another. The male officer seems to lower to the ground as the man repeatedly strikes him. Meanwhile a female officer is restraining the man in blue, but he appears to break free and strike her and another female officer, with one ending up on the ground. The male officer then seems to point his taser at the man in a dark t-shirt before the man in blue runs at him from behind. They appear to grapple until the man in blue lies still on the ground, face-down, and a woman kneels by his side. The officer then appears to kick and then stamp on his head, which was shown in the footage already widely circulated. Greater Manchester Police has opened a public portal for more footage and it is appealing for witnesses to three incidents. The first is “an altercation between passengers” from Qatar Airways flight QR023 that arrived at 7.20 p.m., which they said may have taken place on the flight or T2 baggage hall. There was then a “violent altercation involving members of the public” in T2 at about 8.22 p.m., GMP said. At 8.28 p.m. at the terminal’s car park pay point area three police officers were assaulted and left with head injuries including a broken nose, it added. After Manchester Evening News published the latest footage, Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said in a statement: “As I said on Thursday, this is a complicated situation with two sides to it. “It is why I urged people not to rush to judgment. “Following incidents in the run-up to the footage people saw this week, four individuals were arrested and are now on police bail. “It is frustrating that we have not been able to put more video into the public domain but that is because this is a live investigation. “People now need to step back and allow the IOPC’s criminal investigation into the officer’s conduct to move forward, alongside the parallel GMP investigation into other potential offences, so that a complete picture can be presented. “Given all these investigations are ongoing, it would not be appropriate to comment further.” The family of the man who was reportedly kicked and stamped on issued a “plea for calm” and urged people not to take part in any further protests, their MP said earlier on Saturday. Paul Waugh, the newly elected Labour MP for Rochdale, shared a statement written by the family urging people to give those involved “time to heal” and for “due process to take its course.” Mr. Waugh shared an image of the family’s statement on X on Saturday morning and wrote: “They have issued a plea for calm and ask for no further protests—they want due process to take its course and urge everyone to respect their wishes. “Yesterday’s meeting in Rochdale made clear that this is a community that strongly believes in the rule of law, that the criminal justice system should follow the evidence wherever it leads, and that offenders should be punished appropriately. “Those present also rightly stressed that the law should be applied equally to everyone and that no one, particularly the police, should be above the law.” The officer facing a criminal investigation was also served with a disciplinary notice to inform him he was being investigated for potential gross misconduct for a number of alleged breaches of police professional standards, including his use of force, an IOPC spokesman said. On Wednesday, a large crowd protested outside Rochdale police station, reportedly shouting “GMP shame on you”, while on Thursday, demonstrators blocked roads and tram lines in a protest which started outside Mr. Burnham’s office in central Manchester.",

                    "title": "TikTok lawyer in the middle of Manchester Airport incident speaks up after new video of assault emerges, insisting there is no excuse for stepping on teen’s head",
                    "text": "The controversial TikTok lawyer at the centre of the Manchester Airport furore has broken his silence for the first time since new footage of the ‘attack’ emerged. Akhmed Yakoob, who is representing the two brothers involved in the incident, said: ‘After reviewing the CCTV footage from Manchester Airport, nothing can justify a kick to the head to a defenceless man and a stomp to the head. Those are my views.’ In a post on social media, he continued: ‘These officers are highly trained, they shouldn’t be losing control or seeing red. What do you guys think?’ The intervention comes after the dramatic footage revealed that three police officers were ‘viciously’ attacked – leaving one with a broken nose and one slumped on the floor – moments before one of them kicked a teenager in the head. It sheds new light on the situation that provoked uproar with allegations of police brutality and racism being made when videos of part of the violent ordeal were shared online as officers attempted to arrest 19-year-old Fahir Muhammed Amas. The footage provoked uproar, with a series of anti-police protests held in Rochdale, where Fahir and his brother Ammad – who was also involved in the clash – are from. Tensions were then raised further when Mr Yakoob claimed that the incident had been an ‘attempted assassination’. While senior police sources admitted one officer seen kicking the teenager appears to have lost control, they insist the full picture is far more complicated than initially portrayed. ‘All three of the officers have been violently attacked,’ a well-connected source told the Mail this weekend. Sources believe some of the officers may even have temporarily lost consciousness during the outburst. In a video published last night, Mr Yakoob – who had until now refused to comment on the latest footage uncovered by the Mail on Sunday – claimed ‘I do not promote violence’ purporting that he had tried to deescalate tensions. ‘I have been behind the de-escalation of the whole situation,’ he told TikTok followers. ‘I urged protesters at Rochdale Police Station to go home. ‘I attended a protest in Manchester City Centre attempting to stop trams from operating. I urged them not to do so and calmed them down and they went home. ‘I’ve urged everyone not to attend the protest at Manchester Airport. We are not here to put the public life into difficulty, we want justice for the family.’ It comes after Andy Burnham reissued calls for calm this morning amid growing fears that ‘tensions could boil over’ after the shocking new footage emerged last night. In a bid to quell tensions, Mr Burnham once again insisted there were ‘two sides’ to this ‘complicated situation’ which escalated ‘very quickly’ and became a ‘very violent situation’. ‘These situations can be quite dangerous. people’s careers are put on the line in these situations,’ the mayor told BBC Breakfast this morning. ‘We all feel for the police officers who were injured as a result of what happens and there is a whole lot of stuff that comes together and it’s really important we do it better the next time.’ When probed on how long the police investigation could take, Mr Burnham said ‘you can’t put a timeline on these things’ but hoped it would be completed ‘as quickly as possible given the huge interest in the whole issue’. He went on to criticise the ‘social media age’, calling for people to consider the whole picture before making a snap judgement. Mr Burnham added: ‘We live in a world where we see a fragment and everyone rushes to judgement.’ ‘If the whole picture had been put out straight away it would enabled people to make a more rounded judgement. But it is not always as easy as that because sometimes footage could be used in a trial and it can’t be put out as could impact potential proceedings. ‘The social media age we are living in now, people end up taking a side, but life is more complicated and the truth often lies in between. And did tell people to be careful and that it was a very complicated situation.’ The dramatic CCTV footage, which emerged online last night, shows: Fahir punching a female police officer in the face, breaking her nose, before knocking down a second woman officer; His brother Amaad throwing a barrage of ‘full-blooded’ punches at an armed male officer, leaving him stunned and slumped on the floor; Fahir punching the male officer and grabbing him by the neck in a ‘chokehold’, which he released only when one of the female officers tasered him. Mr Burnham added while speaking on Sky News: ‘It’s a complicated situation, a very violent situation and there were issues on both sides. ‘And that’s why I asked other people not to rush tojudgement because of the complexity of it. ‘And simply nobody out there – everyone who’s having their say – nobody has got the facts’. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) was plunged into crisis last week after several videos of the violence, recorded on mobile phones by onlookers, were posted online. They showed Fahir being kicked in the head and stamped on by a male officer as he lay on the ground in an airport car park on Tuesday night. Amid chaotic scenes, the same male officer was then seen ordering Amaad, 25, on to the floor, stamping on his thigh and hitting him on the back of his head. Despite their lawyer Mr Yakoob being accused of sparking more chaos on the streets of Rochdale, in a TikTok video last night the lawyer insisted he ‘does not promote violence’. He claimed he had been ‘behind the deescalation of the whole situation’ by ‘urging protesters to go home’ ‘Definitely at some points there was a concern that the tensions might boil over – there’s not hiding from that,’ Neil Emmott, the leader of Rochdale borough council said. Fahir’s family had urged protesters not to attend any more protests at Manchester Airport in a statement on Friday night, telling people to ‘refrain’ from attending the planned demonstration. ‘We would not like anyone to be inconvenienced as a result,’ they wrote on social media. Meanwhile Muslim community leaders condemned the ‘absolute condemnation of the horrific actions’ of some GMP officers before reassuring locals that a ‘full and proper investigation will take place with community engagement’. The male officer has been told by the Independent Office for Police Conduct watchdog (IOPC) that he is facing a criminal probe for assault and will be interviewed under caution ‘as soon as possible’. Until last night, little has been known about what happened in the moments leading up to the events captured by other passengers on their mobile phones – or how things escalated. The Mail on Sunday, however, has spoken to a well-informed source with detailed knowledge of the controversial incident. Last night, as the extraordinary CCTV footage emerged online, the source gave the first blow-by-blow account of what is alleged to have happened. It is understood that Fahir and Amaad travelled to Manchester Airport to meet their mother, who is believed to have flown there from Pakistan via Doha in Qatar on a Qatar Airways flight. Words are said to have been exchanged between their mother and a male passenger on board the flight, which landed at 7.20pm. The argument is thought to have continued in the baggage hall of Terminal 2, with claims that the male passenger pushed his trolley into the men’s mother. At 8.22pm, after the woman met her two sons and told them about the incident on the flight, a ‘violent altercation’ erupted in a Starbucks coffee shop within the terminal. Two armed police officers, a man and a woman, along with a female patrol officer responded to the call and intercepted the woman passenger and her two sons at 8.28pm on the ground floor of Terminal 2’s West car park. The CCTV footage reveals the three officers attempted to arrest Fahir as he used a car park ticket machine. He is shown resisting before Amaad throws a barrage of at least six punches at the male police officer, who crumples on to a row of metal seats. ‘The male police officer went forward to arrest him and put hands on him,’ the source said. ‘The lad resisted arrest and rained absolute full-blooded punches at the officer. The officer slumped down at the side of the vending machine while that lad was raining punches on him.’ Fahir is then shown lashing out, first punching one female officer in the side of the head and then smashing the second woman officer in the face, knocking her off her feet and leaving her sprawled on the floor. The second female officer, who has red hair and is seen in the mobile phone footage apparently dazed and holding her head, suffered a broken nose. ‘All the punches were full-blooded haymakers,’ the source said. ‘He smashed the red-haired officer in the face, poleaxed her basically, flattened her out and broke her nose. How can you smash a woman police officer in the face? It is vile.’ The footage then shows Fahir throwing at least another four punches at the first female officer, who is knocked to her knees. ‘He was pummelling her,’ the source said. ‘And I’m told she has temporarily lost consciousness. ‘So he has broken the red-haired officer’s nose and then, when he is grabbed by the firearms officer, he has launched in on her, raining vicious blows on her.’ By this point the male officer had got back to his feet and was aiming his Taser at Amaad. Fahir, however, is shown charging into the back of the male officer, punching him in the head before grabbing him around the neck. ‘He [the male police officer] doesn’t know what is happening other than he is being choked from behind,’ the source said. It is claimed the male officer suffered a suspected broken jaw and may also have been temporarily knocked out. The fight ended only when the first female officer was able to stagger back to her feet and fire her Taser at Fahir, which knocked him over. ‘She tasered him,’ the source said. ‘That knocked him down to the ground, so he released the chokehold.’ It is at this point – as seen by millions in the mobile phone footage – that the male police officer kicks Fahir in the head and apparently stamps on him as he lies on the floor. The source conceded the officer – who has since been suspended by GMP – appeared to have been gripped by a ‘red mist’ but stressed that airports are ‘high risk’ locations and that the two armed officers would have been concerned about having their firearms snatched from them. ‘You can’t have people attacking, choking a police officer, who has got a firearm on his side,’ the source said. ‘If that had been a French or an Italian airport, the police officers would possibly have shot them dead.’ Sources also fear that the officers involved could be forced into hiding – in a disturbing echo of an incident in 2021 when a religious studies teacher at Batley Grammar School in West Yorkshire was forced to leave his home after showing a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad in class. ‘We could end up with another Batley Grammar School situation here,’ the source said. Other sources have suggested that the new revelations might still not be the full picture of what was a hugely chaotic incident. One source last week reportedly claimed the brothers said their mother had been ‘hit in the face and we were being treated unfairly’. A family member yesterday denied the brother had instigated the violence. ‘No, they did not fight first,’ they said. ‘The police officer hurt his mum and that’s when he tried to protect his mum. I don’t know the full story.’ Mr Yakoob – who has been dubbed the ‘TikTok lawyer’ because of his regular social media videos – declined to comment on the account given to the MoS. However, he added: ‘Right now the brothers are resting after going through a lot of trauma.’ On Wednesday, a large crowd gathered outside Rochdale police station, reportedly shouting ‘GMP shame on you’, while on Thursday demonstrators blocked roads and tram lines which started outside Mr Burnham’s office in central Manchester. Last night Paul Waugh, the newly elected Labour MP for Rochdale, said: ‘All our communities in Rochdale are united in a strong belief in the rule of law, that the criminal justice system should follow the evidence wherever it leads, that offenders should be punished appropriately. ‘No one should be above the law, whether that is the police or anyone else. ‘When I met the Assistant Chief Constable on Thursday, I passed on my concerns for the female police officer and others injured in the run-up to this incident. ‘As I’ve said consistently throughout this, the police face a very difficult job every day in keeping us all safe and both the investigation by GMP and the IOPC investigation into the police officer’s conduct should gather the full facts. ‘The footage of the officer kicking a man on the ground remains shocking. It’s right that the case was referred to the IOPC and that the officer was suspended.’ Two men have been arrested on suspicion of assault, assault of an emergency worker, affray and obstructing police. Two other men have been arrested on suspicion of affray and assault of an emergency worker. The four men, aged between 19 and 31, have since been bailed. Mr Burnham said: ‘It is frustrating that we have not been able to put more video into the public domain but that is because this is a live investigation. ‘People need to step back and allow the IOPC’s criminal investigation into the officer’s conduct to move forward, alongside the parallel GMP investigation into other potential offences, so that a complete picture can be presented.’ GMP last week said three officers ‘were subject to a violent assault, where they were punched to the ground’ and taken to hospital. In a new statement issued on Friday night, GMP Chief Constable Stephen Watson added: ‘It is a source of profound regret that this week’s incident at Manchester Airport has caused shock and upset in some of our communities. ‘While we are constrained in releasing further information or footage about the incident due to the conduct and criminal investigations, we are committed to providing the fullest practical assistance to the IOPC.’",

                    "text": "ST.CLOUD - Supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance enthusiastically stood for hours in withering heat Saturday to get into the ticket's first Minnesota rally of this election season, chanting \"USA!\" and \"Fight, fight, fight!\" as they pumped their fists in eager anticipation. Vance was greeted with loud applause and kicked off 20 minutes of remarks, saying the ticket \"stands with Israel,\" mentioning the rocket attack on a school on the country's northern border as an example of the bad things that can happen when Trump isn't president. The Ohio senator talked about how Trump \"wiped the debate stage\" with President Joe Biden, and suggested the crowd \"thank President Trump for getting rid of Joe Biden once and for all.\" Then he pivoted to attacking the media; when the crowd booed, Vance said: \"They deserve it.\" He said the media had covered for Biden and now compares Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King when she is really a \"card-carrying member of the San Francisco lunatic fringe.\" He talked about saving the country for \"Americans of every race, color and creed.\" Vance said Harris owns \"every failure\" of the Biden administration, referring to her repeatedly as the \"border czar\" who would give free health care and college tuition to undocumented immigrants. \"She wants to hand over control of our country to people who shouldn't be here in the first place,\" he said. Then speaking directly to those he called \"illegal aliens,\" Vance said: \"Start packing your bags now.\" The crowd launched into a spontaneous chant of \"USA! USA!\" Before Vance spoke, U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., warmed up the crowd and enthused about the GOP turning Minnesota red in a presidential election for the first time since 1972. The House majority whip jabbed Gov. Tim Walz, who reportedly is on the short list for consideration to join Harris on the ticket. \"Walz is an empty suit who should not be allowed anywhere near the White House,\" Emmer said. A capacity crowd of 8,000 filled the Herb Brooks National Hockey Center; hundreds took up standing-room-only spots on what would be the ice sheet in the arena on the St. Cloud State University campus. The first supporters lined up to get in at 2 a.m. As 6 p.m. approached, hundreds — if not thousands — remained outside in muggy 90-degree weather in a line that snaked for blocks. They were either turned away or left on their own to watch the rally on an outdoor screen. The most popular outfits included flag-themed attire and red MAGA hats, metallic gold shoes and all sorts of campaign T-shirts. One bore an image of the White House and read \"Stolen Property,\" and another had Trump's mugshot with the line, \"I'm voting for the Convicted Felon.\" Debi Rancour, 68, of St. Michael, Minn., arrived hours early in support of Trump's views on the Southern border and what she called his faith-based conservatism. \"This is on my bucket list. It's a dream come true,\" she said of the rally, her first. Rancour also said she thinks the 2020 election was stolen, a belief espoused by Trump that has been proved false. \"I've got a hat right here,\" she said. \"It says, 'Trump Won.'\" Her sister, Janet Rancour, 66, of Champlin, said she's excited for a second Trump term. \"We didn't get to see what Trump could do last time because they were so worried about getting him out,\" she said. Cynthia Gail, 66, a teacher from Albert Lea, said she respects Trump for persisting. \"I'm not proud of some of his past but there's such a thing as forgiveness,\" she said. \"And nobody else is going to be able to tackle the tasks to protect the United States.\" Despite the energy in St. Cloud, Minnesota Republicans have a steep hill to climb with Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket. A KSTP-TV poll on Friday showed Harris leads Trump by 10 percentage points in the state, a gap larger than Biden had before announcing he was stepping down from the race. Earlier Saturday, DFLers gathered in St. Paul to hear from Walz before knocking on doors for Harris. As he has done in recent days, the governor sharply targeted the GOP ticket. \"This is the beautiful tapestry of America and not one damn stupid red hat amongst you,\" he told the crowd of volunteers. Jumping on the hockey theme, Walz said Trump was \"here today in the State of Hockey to complete his trifecta: He lost in '16; he lost in '20; he loses in '24.\" In St. Cloud, Tim Tuuri, 66, of White Bear Lake said he came to see Trump, Vance and GOP-endorsed U.S. Senate candidate Royce White. \"We just want to be out here with our fellow patriots who love our country,\" Tuuri said. Taylor Hill, 24, of Sartell, Minn., arrived at 6 a.m. and secured a shaded waiting spot, where she set up a tent and card table. \"I'm excited to hear [Trump] unfiltered, not through the media,\" Hill said. \"You can't get more from the horse's mouth than here.\" Hill said she knows Trump is divisive, but \"in our political climate, we need someone who is decisive and powerful.\" Army veteran Allen Zierden of Albany, Minn., was in line at 11 a.m. He said he's concerned about the economy and gas prices. \"Trump's chances of flipping Minnesota are higher than Harris winning the election,\" Zierden said, adding that he'd hate to see Walz on the Democratic ticket. Everett Duckworth drove to St. Cloud from Fargo for his first Trump rally. The 62-year-old said he belongs to the Sons of Liberty, a group that works to increase awareness about the government \"infringing on the constitutional rights, freedoms and liberties of its people.\" He said he wants to bring the movement to Minnesota. \"It's so encouraging to see Republicans doing what they need to do to make a difference,\" Duckworth said. \"If we're going to do it, it's going to be this year. I think we've got a good shot.\" Michelle Hoeper of Villard, Minn., said she came to the rally \"to show people here in Minnesota, maybe even those who are just driving by, that there are more people here that support [Trump], maybe more than they realize.\" Staff writer Kyeland Jackson contributed to this story.",

                    "text": "ST. CLOUD, Minn. — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance went hard after Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday in their first joint Minnesota appearance, portraying the presumptive Democratic nominee as a failure and mocking her for everything from being a San Francisco prosecutor to her laugh. Trump said voters would reject Harris’ “crazy liberal extremism” in a “massive landslide.” He and Vance repeatedly called her the “border czar,” blaming her for the migrant crisis at the nation’s southern border. If she’s elected, Trump said, Harris would “kill Social Security and Medicare” while making inflation worse. Under the Democrats, Trump said, the United States would face “four more years of weakness, chaos and probably World War III,” while he would bring back “leadership, competence, common sense and strength.” A capacity crowd of 8,000 filled the Herb Brooks National Hockey Center, and hundreds took up standing-room-only space on what would be the ice sheet in the St. Cloud State University arena. Thousands more who couldn’t get in watched the speech on a large screen outside the arena, cheering wildly when Trump called out to them multiple times. Trump and Vance repeatedly railed against “illegal aliens” and complained about the media and the last election. They detailed few policy proposals of their own beyond “overfunding the police” rather than defunding them, and indicated they will portray Harris as overly friendly to criminals in the campaign. Trump called Harris a “radical left lunatic,” saying “her big thing” is to “defund the police.” Harris has not pushed that position since the movement in 2020, and Trump said she should be held accountable for her initial support: “Politicians don’t change,” he said. The crowd broke into chants of “USA!” and “Fight, fight, fight” frequently through the event. Although President Joe Biden has dropped out of the race, Trump targeted him for plenty of criticism, ranging from the president’s speech patterns to how he navigates stairs. Rally attendees had lined up to get in as early as 2 a.m. When the doors closed before 6 p.m. , hundreds — if not thousands — remained outside in the muggy 90-degree heat. Trump and Vance used similar lines of attack on Harris, including her voicing support for the Minnesota Freedom Fund in the wake of George Floyd’s murder in 2020, and blamed her for releasing dangerous criminals. The Minneapolis-based nonprofit pays criminal and immigration bonds for people in Twin Cities jails and detention facilities. Trump’s speech ran for more than an hour and repeated some of his favorite topics of late, including a reference to the fictional movie cannibal Hannibal Lector. He said Democrats and the media are trying to make Harris into the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. However, he said, “Thatcher didn’t laugh like that, did she?” And he called Harris “a dangerous person who’s not smart.” Vance, who spoke first, was greeted with loud applause as he kicked off 20 minutes of remarks. The Ohio senator talked about how Trump “wiped the debate stage” with Biden in June, and then pivoted to attacking the media. When the crowd booed the media, Vance said: “They deserve it.” He said the media covered for Biden’s shortcomings and is now trying to portray Harris as the Rev.

                    "text": "Republican front-runner Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, rallied supporters on Saturday in Minnesota, a state that hasn't supported a GOP presidential candidate since 1972, as the presidential campaign moves into its crucial last 100 days.According to The Associated Press, over an hour and a half was dedicated to Trump's speech to applauding audiences who were brandishing signs in support of law enforcement and demanding the deportation of illegal immigrants. He persisted in his increasing criticism of Harris over immigration and criminal activity.She was referred to as a \"crazy liberal\" by him, and he charged that she wanted to \"defund the police,\" while he wanted to \"overfund the police.\"Trump remarked, \"She has no clue, she's evil,\" implying that Harris had not succeeded in her duties as vice president concerning the border. \"Kamala Harris' deadly destruction of America's borders is completely and totally disqualifying for her to be president.\"In addition, Trump attacked Harris on abortion, calling her a \"absolute radical,\" as if he saw a window of opportunity to criticize her after she emerged as the lead proponent of abortion rights in the Biden administration.Trump also criticized Harris for a 2020 tweet she wrote following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis at the hands of the police. In an attempt to address systemic injustices, the post urged readers to support demonstrators by making a donation to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which has been campaigning to reform the bail system and post criminal bonds for individuals.However, the former president also reused a large portion of his earlier criticism of Biden, reported NBC News, demonstrating how his campaign aimed to keep people aware of Biden's shortcomings even after the president withdrew from the race and endorsed Harris.Trump made fun of Biden's golf skills, mental faculties, and public persona. He called the president derogatory names and attacked the son of his former opponent, Hunter Biden. Trump made fun of Biden's gait, weaving around the platform to give the impression that he was unable to leave an event.On the other hand, the Harris campaign in a statement blasted Trump as a \"bitter, unhinged, 78-year-old convicted felon.\"Trump's comments came after a passionate address by Vance, who focused primarily on topics that excite the Republican base, such as crime and border security. Additionally, he launched a broadside at the news media, claiming that they were drawing comparisons between Martin Luther King Jr. and the first Black woman and someone of South Asian ancestry to head a major political ticket.The St. Cloud, Minnesota, gathering was intended to symbolise the campaign's optimism about its chances in the Midwest, especially in light of President Joe Biden's seeming weakness before to his decision to withdraw from the race. After losing Wisconsin and Michigan to Democrats in 2016, Trump has directed more of his attention towards Minnesota, a state where he hopes to defeat Democrats.",

                    "text": "The New York Yankees do not appear intent on settling after the Jazz Chisholm Jr. trade. Andy Martino of SNY reported that the Yankees are staying \"active in trade conversations\" and are looking to fill other needs on the team. \"After trading for Jazz Chishom Jr., the Yankees remained active in trade conversations on multiple fronts,\" Martino wrote. \"Upon acquiring Chisholm, the Yanks expected to take advantage of his versatility, but it's worth noting that the positions that Chisholm has played in the majors -- second base, shortstop, and center field -- are well-covered by current Yankees personnel.\" Martino listed relievers Tanner Scott, Jason Adam and Pete Fairbanks as players New York has called for, and starter Jameson Taillon was another named floated as a potential trade target. Scott is currently with the Miami Marlins and has been dominant in the bullpen. He has a 6-5 record with a 1.18 ERA in 45.2 innings. His non-inclusion in the Chisholm trade could signal that the Yankees are out on him, but he does remain on the market and is someone the team could look back to. Adam and Fairbanks are both with the division rival-Tampa Bay Rays and New York should be very familiar with the two. Adam has a 4-2 record with a 2.49 ERA in 47 innings while Fairbanks has a 2-3 record with a 3.19 ERA in 36.2 innings. Taillon would be a familiar face as he spent two seasons with the Yankees prior to joining the Chicago Cubs in 2023. He is 7-5 with a 2.96 ERA in 100.1 innings in 2024 and has two seasons remaining on his contract. The Yankees are 60-45 and own the top Wild Card spot in the American League. New York is just 1.5 games behind the Baltimore Orioles for the AL East lead and the addition of Chisholm should bolster the infield depth. While this could be viewed as a solid position to be in heading into the later stages of the season, it is disappointing after the team's strong start. New York had the best record in baseball during the earlier stages of the season and entered July with a 54-32 record. The team has gone just 6-13 in July and lost its hold on the division. The team is at risk of falling further down the standings and replenishing the roster at the deadline could be what is needed to get the Yankees back on track. The MLB Trade Deadline is set for July 30 at 6 p.m. ET.",

                    "text": "BOSTON (AP) — Looking to spark a struggling club, the New York Yankees acquired Jazz Chisholm Jr. from the Miami Marlins on Saturday for three minor leaguers: catcher Agustín Ramírez, infielder Jared Serna and infielder Abrahan Ramírez. New York entered Saturday 10-23 after a 50-22 start, plagued by sputtering starting pitching, a shaky bullpen and an offense overly reliant on Aaron Judge and Juan Soto following injuries to Giancarlo Stanton and Anthony Rizzo. Third baseman DJ LeMahieu and left fielder Alex Verdugo have been in deep slumps. An All-Star second baseman in 2022, the 26-year-old Chisholm has played center field for most of the past two seasons. He is batting .249 with 13 homers and 50 RBIs this year and is a .246 career hitter with 66 homers and 205 RBIs in five seasons. Chisholm has 22 stolen bases, matching last year’s total and one shy of his career high. “Very talented, athletic, speed, power, you know, seems like versatility, you know, can play a lot of different places,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. “I’ve only seen him from afar, obviously, but obviously a very talented young player.” Chisholm has a $2,625,000 salary after losing to the Marlins in arbitration. He is eligible for arbitration again after the 2024 and 2025 seasons and can become a free agent after the 2026 World Series. LeMahieu, a two-time batting champion, didn’t make his season debut until May 28 after breaking his right foot when he fouled off a pitch during a spring training game this past March 16. A three-time All-Star, he is hitting .178 with one homer, 12 RBIs in 135 at-bats, and he has just two hits in his last 28 at-bats. LeMahieu’s .495 OPS ranked 383rd among 392 players with 100 or more plate appearances entering Saturday and his 59.1% ground ball rate was seventh. LeMahieu struggled following a broken sesamoid bone in his right big toe that led to ligament damage in his second toe in 2022. He hit .220 in the first half last year but .273 in the second. He has two full seasons remaining in a $90 million, six-year contract that pays $15 million annually. Verdugo entered Saturday batting .160 (20 for 125) with one homer and seven RBIs from June 15 on, dropping his season average from .266 to .231. In addition, rookie first baseman Ben Rice was 4 for 50 after hitting three homers in a July 7 victory over the Red Sox. Agustín Ramírez, 22, hit .269 with 20 homers and 69 RBIs this year at Double-A and Triple-A. Serna, also 22, batted .253 with 13 homers and 58 RBIs with High-A Hudson Valley. Abrahan Ramírez. 19, hit .348 with a pair of homers and 24 RBIs for the Florida Complex League Yankees. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Insiders told TheWrap last week that a major sticking point was wages, specifically long-standing pay disparities that made it difficult for Teamsters’ members to keep up with the cost of living in Los Angeles. The Basic Crafts Deal means the film and television industry has dodged another crippling strike, as just 10 days ago IATSE members overwhelmingly approved that guild’s tentative deal. Collectively, the Teamsters and Basic Crafts represent 7,600 entertainment workers. That includes drivers, dispatchers, electricians, caterers, laborers, cement masons, plumbers, animal trainers and casting directors, among others. The other unions in the Basic Crafts are the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 40, Laborers International Union of North America Local (LIUNA) 724, United Association Plumbers Local (UA) 78 and Operating Plasterers & Cement Masons International Association (OPCMIA) Local 755.

The statement added on Saturday, “The basic crafts spent today working closely with our member-led negotiating committees to finalize a deal with the AMPTP that we can now say is being unanimously recommended by our member-led bargaining committees.” During negotiations, which began on June 10, each member of the five-union Hollywood Basic Crafts group negotiated their own agreements, while the unions bargained together over shared issues. The Teamsters Local 399, for example, bargained its location manager and “Black Book” contracts, which covers drivers and multiple other classifications. With members including the Teamsters Local 399, IBEW Local 40, LiUNA! Local 724, UA Local 78 and OPCMIA Local 755, the Hollywood Basic Crafts bargains on behalf of around 8,000 workers like drivers, animal wranglers, plasterers and electricians. Teamsters Local 399 principal officer led negotiations on behalf of the union, while Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers president Carol Lombardini headed up talks for major Hollywood firms. Heading into the last scheduled week of negotiations, the Teamsters Local 399 convened a town hall with members that featured Dougherty and Teamsters general president Sean O’Brien discussing the negotiations. “I want to be clear; we aren’t looking for a strike, we’re fighting for a fair deal for our members,” said Dougherty. “We won’t, however, bargain against ourselves, we won’t be intimidated to take our priorities off the table, and we won’t be taking any concessions.”",

                    "text": "A coalition of unions representing drivers, mechanics, location managers, electricians and other Hollywood crew members has struck tentative contract deals with the major studios — closing out a long, turbulent chapter of labor activity in the film and TV industry. As of late Saturday night, the Hollywood Basic Crafts and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers have reached agreements on six different contracts. The settlements concluded several weeks of negotiations that became notably tense following a less contentious contract campaign led by fellow crew members union IATSE. \"After a long last 48 hours, we are proud to report that ALL Hollywood Basic Crafts Locals have reached a tentative agreement with the AMPTP late this evening,\" Hollywood Basic Crafts spokesperson Amy Gorton said in a statement. \"The basic crafts spent today working closely with our member-led negotiating committees to finalize a deal with the AMPTP that we can now say is being unanimously recommended by our member-led bargaining committees.\" The six new contracts bargained by the Hollywood Basic Crafts include the Teamsters Local 399 Black Book Agreement covering drivers, dispatchers, transportation administrators, animal trainers, wranglers and mechanics; the Teamsters Local 399 Location Manager Agreement covering location managers, assistant location managers and key assistant location managers; the LiUNA! Local 724 Basic Agreement covering laborers; IBEW Local 40 Basic Agreement covering electricians; the OPCMIA Local 755 Basic Agreement covering plasterers; and the UA Local 78 Basic Agreement covering plumbers. They include terms related to pay, pension and health benefits, streaming residuals, artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles. The old agreements — covering a total of roughly 7,600 below-the-line workers — were set to expire July 31. While bargaining with the AMPTP over the past several weeks, Hollywood Basic Crafts leaders repeatedly called out the entertainment companies for allegedly dragging their feet at the bargaining table and failing to adequately address key issues affecting crew members. The heated tone of the negotiations was a marked shift from IATSE's contract campaign, which transpired largely without incident and culminated in a deal covering some 50,000 craftspeople primarily based in Los Angeles. IATSE members ratified the new Hollywood Basic Agreement earlier this month. The final week of the Hollywood Basic Crafts campaign saw several other entertainment unions — including IATSE, the American Federation of Musicians, the Writers Guild of America, the Directors Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild — issue a joint statement pressuring the AMPTP \"to respect their workforce and make meaningful moves at the negotiating table.\" \"As their contract deadline of July 31st quickly approaches, the clock is ticking on the AMPTP to address the unique needs of the various classifications within these unions,\" the statement read. \"Our guilds and unions stand strongly united behind the Teamsters and Hollywood Basic Crafts until they gain the compensation and working conditions they deserve.\" On Friday, the AMPTP came to the bargaining table with what it deemed its \"last, best and final\" offer, the union said. The Hollywood Basic Crafts said it rejected that proposal and presented the studios with a counteroffer it felt strongly about. \"These aren’t just proposals on a piece of paper to our members. These are meaningful terms and conditions that impact their livelihoods,\" Lindsay Dougherty, principal officer of Teamsters Local 399 and chairperson of the Hollywood Basic Crafts, said Saturday in a statement. \"We think our response to the producer’s package is reasonable and would be a deal that gets this over the finish line.” Throughout negotiations, Hollywood Basic Crafts leaders maintained that they were not looking to call a strike but cautioned that they were not interested in extending talks past the contracts' expiration date. Fears of a potential crew member walkout peaked in the immediate aftermath of the writers' and actors' strikes, which rendered thousands of entertainment workers jobless for about six months. Even since the work stoppages lifted, many remain unemployed due to an ongoing industry contraction that predates the labor disputes. Concerns of a third strike began to dissipate, though, once the IATSE contracts started falling into place.",

                    "text": "Belal Muhammad became the new UFC welterweight champion with a unanimous decision win over Leon Edwards to end UFC 304 from Co-op Live in Manchester, England. The challenger put together a strong first round. He landed an early takedown that established his wrestling as a threat, but it was the combination of his takedowns and boxing that helped him get the early lead. Muhammad was able to find a home for his high-volume striking and landed another takedown at the end of the round for good measure. The grappling continued to be a factor in the second round. Muhammad dropped Edwards on his head and dominated the round after taking Edwards' back. That rally was short-lived, though. Edwards came out aggressive in the fourth round before Muhammad closed the distance, took him to the ground and spent most of the round in dominant position. Edwards made one final push to win the fight with under a minute left. He reversed position and rained down elbows on Muhammad, splitting him open and ending on a strong note. Unfortunately for him, it wasn't enough to keep his belt. Muhammad's win not only gives him his first UFC championship, but brings some resolution to their 2021 matchup that ended in a No Contest. An accidental eyepoke from Edwards left Muhammad unable to continue and the fight was declared a No Contest. Rather than run things back right away, Edwards ended up getting a fight against Nate Diaz which propelled him to a shot at the title. Two wins over Kamaru Usman and a title defense against Colby Covington propelled him to the No. 3 spot on Bleacher Report's pound-for-pound list. Meanwhile, Muhammad continued racking up wins. The Chicago native picked up wins over Stephen Thompson, Vicente Luque and Gilbert Burns on his way to finally getting a title shot. Now he knows there's a new wave of welterweight title contenders coming for him. \"When my career is all said and done, I want to be the guy that beat every single great guy in my era, every guy that they thought would beat me,\" he said in an interview with \"The Schmo\" (h/t Christopher De Santiago of Sports Illustrated). \"I want to walk through them all, whoever it is, line them up. You have Shavkat, you have Ian Garry, you have JDM, all these guys. I don't think any of them are really scheduled to fight right now, but whoever the UFC puts in front of me.\" Shavkat Rakhmonov is the most obvious contender outside of a rematch with Edwards. However, Jack Della Maddalena and Ian Machado Garry aren't far behind. Muhammad had to put together a lot of wins to get to this point. Now he's going to have to keep winning tough fights to maintain the crown.",

                    "text": "In the end, Belal Muhammad did exactly what he said he would at UFC 304. The Palestinian-American welterweight returned to action in the main event of the Saturday card in Manchester, England — which kicked off at an ungodly 3:00 a.m. local time — challenging British champion Leon Edwards for the UFC welterweight title on enemy soil. Heading into the fight, Muhammad was unendingly confident. Over and over, he told us how he would beat Edwards, even revealing specific details of his game plan, but almost nobody took it seriously. The Chicago-based welterweight, who had won 10 straight fights ahead of his trip to Manchester, entered as a big underdog with the confidence of only his team and his most dedicated fans. All of his doubters were wrong. I was wrong. While Edwards had his moments in the fight, Muhammad was in control of nearly all of the 25 allotted minutes, not only having success with his wrestling — as some believed he could — but banging his foe up on the feet, which few expected. By the time the five-round fight was over, he had landed 192 of 281 attempted strikes, succeeded on nine of 13 attempted takedowns, and used those takedowns to rack up 12:02 of control — a clear recipe for a unanimous decision win. By the time the belt was being wrapped around his waist, all the British crowd could do was boo. \"I see you guys with watery eyes right now,\" he said, acknowledging that he had spoiled the night — or the morning — for the fans in attendance. Muhammad's win over Edwards will go down as one of the biggest upsets of 2024 — particularly given that Edwards seemed to be dominating him until their first fight, in 2021, ended with an eye poke. The new champion's future, however, is unclear. Having just fought, and seemingly sustained minimal injuries, there's a good chance he'll have to defend his belt before the year is out, but it's difficult to say who his opponent will be. There are a ton of options. Edwards, who had defended the title twice before rematching Muhammad, could be afforded an opportunity for a rematch, particularly given the early success he had in their 2021 no-contest. The former champ, for his part, seems to want the chance. \"My body felt tired,\" he said after the early-morning loss, laying out plans to fight again before the year's out. \"We'll get it back again.\" More likely than Muhammad vs. Edwards III, however, is that the new champ will end up defending his welterweight title against one of the many dangerous contenders near the top of the weight class: namely, Kazakhstan's Shavkat Rakhmonov, Ireland's Ian Garry, and Australia's Jack Della Maddalena. All of those men have a fair shot at beating the new champ — and most would likely enter the Octagon with him as betting favorites. Rakhmonov and Garry are unbeaten at 19-0 and 12-0 apiece. Della Maddalena has lost twice, but has won 17 straight, including a recent stoppage of former title challenger Gilbert Burns. With such ferocious contenders at the top of the welterweight division, the title may change hands often over the next year or two, but Muhammad is confident in his reign. \"I'm no Khabib [Nurmagomedov], I'm no GSP (Georges St-Pierre,)\" he said after his title win, comparing himself to other MMA greats. \"I'm my own man. Now the world knows it and the world sees it.\" While it remains to be seen who will Muhammad will fight next, and how long he will hang onto the belt, one thing is clear: We all need to pick up our forks, put our napkins on our laps, and eat some crow. Almost nobody believed Muhammad could beat Edwards, and he didn't just beat the champ, but did it decisively, behind enemy lines, at a time of day when almost nobody was awake. His nickname, for most of his career, has been \"Remember the Name.\" When coupled with his unabashed confidence heading into his first UFC title bid, that nickname made him a bit of a laughing stock. Most people thought he would go down as a good but not great welterweight who would never get his hands on a UFC belt. After UFC 304, we'll all remember his name.",

                    "text": "Marvel officially confirmed that Joe and Anthony Russo on stage to announce that they’ll be directing both the fifth “Avengers” film (now titled XXX) and “Avengers: Secret Wars.” They did this by first showing a sizzle of all of the Marvel Studios films the Russos had previously directed — “Captain America: The Winter Soldier,” “Captain America: Civil War,” “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Avengers: Endgame.” As they walked out, the thunderous crowd shouted “Russo! Russo!” The Russos said, “We missed you guys. You are the best damn fans in the world.” “Are we really gonna do this? Hear me out, when we directed ‘Avengers: Endgame, Joe and I truly believed it was the end of the road for us in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,” Anthony said. After a “Avengers: Secret Wars” logo appeared on screen, Joe said, “There is one very important character that is required to do ‘Secret Wars’ justice… it could be the most important character in all of the Marvel Universe.” Actors dressed as Doctor Doom flooded the stage and eerie music played throughout Hall H. The fifth “Avengers” movie will now be called “Avengers: Doomsday.” And Doctor Doom will be played by Robert Downey, Jr. himself. Fans were first introduced to Kang — or rather, a variant of him known as He Who Remains — in the first season of Marvel’s “Loki” series. We only properly met Kang the Conqueror in “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.” He was set to be the villain at the center of literally everything for the next few phases, a lá Thanos, but in December Jonathan Majors, the actor who played Kang, was found guilty on charges of assault and harassment in his New York domestic violence case. Following the verdict, Marvel fired him, and hasn’t indicated how they might fill the hole in their universe until now. “Avengers: The Kang Dynasty” and “Avengers: Secret Wars” were first announced back in 2022, once again during Marvel’s Hall H panel. “The Kang Dynasty” was set to hit theaters on May 2, 2025, with “Secret Wars” following on Nov. 7, 2025.

                    "text": "UPDATED with more details: In what came as no surprise, filmmakers Joe and Anthony Russo stepped onstage at San Diego Comic-Con‘s Hall H to confirm that they’re returning to helm the next Avengers movies: a new title Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars that will hit theaters in 2026 and 2027, respectively. Before they came onstage, a reel of their movies Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame, Captain America Winter Soldier and Captain America Civil War played. “We miss you guys,” said Joe Russo. Anthony Russo thought Endgame was their last movie. “that four movie run was incredible, and it left us with our emotions spent.” “We came to see a road forward with you all,” said Anthony Russo. Anthony Russo said that they have to make a first movie before Secret Wars: Avengers: Doomsday. In order to pull this off, they needed to find the right actor to play Dr. Doom. An actor, clad as the famed Marvel villain stepped on stage of Hall H and unmasked himself as none other than Robert Downey Jr. It was also announced that the Fantastic Four will appear in both Avengers movies, with Doomsday set to premiere in May 2026 and Secret Wars in May 2027. The next two Avengers movies were last announced at Comic-Con 2022 to wrap up phase 6 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Avengers: The Kang Dynasty (May 1, 2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars (May 7, 2027). Clearly Kang Dynasty is not longer in the wake of that pic’s star Jonathan Majors, who played new mega villain Kang the Conqueror was found guilty of reckless assault and harassment in his domestic violence trial by a six-person NYC jury. Marvel fired the actor thereafter. The Russos told us back at The Gray Man premiere in July 2022 that “The one series that we adored growing up was Secret Wars. It’s incredibly ambitious. It would be bigger than Infinity War and Endgame. But it’s a massive undertaking.” The Russos delivered four of the biggest films in Marvel history: Avengers: Endgame ($2.79 billion, the second highest grossing movie of all-time), Avengers: Infinity War ($2.05 billion), Captain America: Civil War ($1.15B) and Captain America: Winter Solider ($714.4M).

During an event on Friday, July 26, hosted by the conservative Christian organization Turning Point Action, Trump, 78, addressed the crowd and implied that if he were to be voted in, \"everything\" would be \"fixed,\" according to multiple sources, including Rolling Stone and The Hill. \"Christians, get out and vote, just this time,\" Trump said as the crowd in West Palm Beach, Fla., cheered, per the outlets. \"You won’t have to do it anymore,\" he said. \"Four more years, you know what, it will be fixed, it will be fine. You won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.\" “I love you Christians. I’m a Christian. I love you, get out, you gotta get out and vote. In four years, you don’t have to vote again, we’ll have it fixed so good you’re not going to have to vote,\" Trump continued. At the same event, Trump also claimed that he would \"once again appoint rock-solid conservative judges who will protect religious liberty,\" per Rolling Stone. In a statement shared by Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign team on Saturday concerning what they called \"Trump’s vow to end democracy,\" Harris for President spokesperson James Singer said: \"When Vice President Harris says this election is about freedom, she means it.\" \"Our democracy is under assault by criminal Donald Trump: After the last election Trump lost, he sent a mob to overturn the results,\" Singer continued. \"This campaign, he has promised violence if he loses, the end of our elections if he wins, and the termination of the Constitution to empower him to be a dictator to enact his dangerous Project 2025 agenda on America,\" he added.

Many Democrats have criticized Trump's rhetoric around the 2020 election, and specifically his claims of voter fraud, after he was defeated by President Joe Biden, as well as the recent Supreme Court decision allowing for presidential immunity for any official acts taken during their time in the White House. Biden, 81, previously cited the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot as one reason that the ruling set a \"dangerous\" precedent because the power of the presidential office \"will no longer be constrained by the law.\" \"[The] American people must decide if they want to entrust the president — once again, the presidency to Donald Trump, now knowing he’ll be even more emboldened to do whatever he pleases whenever he wants to do it,\" Biden said in a speech earlier this month.",

                    "text": "Pittsfield, Massachusetts — Vice President Kamala Harris attended her first major fundraiser Saturday since becoming the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. Speaking to more than 800 attendees in Pittsfield, Massachusetts — mostly composed of Democratic donors — Harris made her campaign pitch and defended her record to that of her rival, former President Donald Trump. \"As attorney general, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges that was scamming students,\" Harris told the fundraiser's attendees. \"Well, Donald Trump ran a for-profit college that scammed students,\" referencing the now defunct Trump University. In 2016, Trump agreed to pay $25 million to settle several civil lawsuits brought by former students. Harris also referred to the May 2023 civil verdict in which a New York jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s. \"As a prosecutor I specialized in sexual abuse cases,\" she said. \"Well, Trump was found liable for committing sexual abuse.\"The vice president told her crowd she hopes Trump will agree to debate her. Prior to President Biden's exit from the race — in the wake of the fallout over his performance in the first debate — the two had agreed to a second debate to take place Sept. 10 on ABC. Trump has said he would debate Harris, but has called for it to be hosted by Fox News. \"You may have seen he just pulled out of our debates,\" Harris said. \"I hope he reconsiders. I hope he reconsiders. We have a lot to talk about.\" Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said Thursday it could not schedule a debate with Harris as \"Democrats very well could still change their minds\" on their nominee. During the fundraiser, Harris also pledged to \"finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act,\" named after the late Georgia congressman and civil rights icon. The bill would restore a provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act which was eliminated by the Supreme Court.Harris also committed to working to curb gun violence and advancing her fight for reproductive rights. \"When Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will sign it into law,\" she said. Harris acknowledged the success of her campaign in the first days since its launch, saying \"momentum is on our side,\" but also telling her donors that \"we got to fight and we are the underdogs in this race.\" The Harris campaign said this week it has raised more than $100 million since its launch. The fundraiser, benefiting the Harris Victory Fund, raised $1.4 million, according to a Harris campaign official, more than triple the initial $400,000 goal. The event marked the first major political event in the Berkshires since a visit from then first lady Michelle Obama in 2012. Pittsfield locals lined up outside of the Colonial Theater where the fundraiser was held, expressing enthusiasm over their city serving as a protagonist in the presidential race. Harris supporters held up banners reading \"Girl Boss,\" \"first female president\" and \"if my cat could vote, she would vote for you,\" a reference to recently-surfaced comments from Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, who claimed in a 2021 interview that the U.S. was being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies,\" and specifically referenced Harris. \"I firmly believe that it is past time to have a woman in charge and I just don't want to go back,\" said Patricia Labendz, a Pittsfield resident. \"We are not going back. I grew up in the '70s, and there was misogyny. A woman's body is her body and nobody should be telling her what to do with it.\"Some residents were also there to show their support for Trump, holding large Trump flags, while a group of pro-Palestinian protesters gathered near the venue. \"Stop playing both sides, pick a side to stand on and stand with it,\" said Eyad Alkurabi, a Pittsfield local. \"If you want to stand with the Palestinian people you need to stand 100%.\"",

                    "text": "During her first fundraiser as the probable Democratic nominee for the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for his efforts to diminish the freedoms of Americans. Harris traveled to Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on Saturday where she was expected to raise more than $1.4 million, her campaign announced, from an audience of hundreds at the Colonial Theatre. That would be $1 million-plus more than the original goal set for the event before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. She told an excited group of supporters that she entered the race as an “underdog,” while expressing confidence that her surging campaign could defeat Trump. “I will fight to move our nation forward,” Harris said. “Donald Trump intends to take our country backwards.” Harris also poked at Trump, and his running mate Sen. JD Vance, for lobbing peculiar attacks at her and other Democrats. The vice president appeared to be alluding to a 2021 interview with Vance in which he slammed some prominent Democrats without biological children, including Harris, as “childless cat ladies” with “no direct stake” in America. “You may have noticed Donald Trump has been resorting to some wild lies about my record and some of what he and his running mate are saying, it is just plain weird,” Harris said. “I mean that’s the box you put that in, right?” Harris’ branding the Republican ticket as “weird” appears to be part of a concerted effort by her campaign to spotlight some of Trump and Vance’s rhetoric as questionable. Earlier this week, the Harris campaign on the social media site X called Vance “weird and creepy” for some of his stances on women’s reproductive rights. Trump, meanwhile, has raised the fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter from the film “Silence of the Lambs” in stump speeches. “These guys are just weird,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat who is on Harris’ shortlist for vice president, said in an MSNBC interview earlier this week. “They’re running for He-man women-haters club or something.” Supporters for the fundraiser included musician James Taylor and many of the state’s Democratic heavyweights, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, former Gov. Deval Patrick and Rep. Richie Neal. Harris took in more than $100 million in donations in the first 48 hours after Biden quit the race, a presidential record, and aides said she has continued to raise money at a steady clip. “This is a people-powered campaign,” Harris said. “And we have momentum.” Harris, a former prosecutor in her home state of California, also derided Trump for his legal troubles. She noted his recent conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records in New York, a jury finding the former president of being liable for sexual abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996, and a $25 million settlement paid to attendees of the now-defunct real estate seminar called Trump University. “I’ve been dealing with people like him my entire career,” Harris said. She added, “So in this campaign, and I say in all seriousness, I will proudly put my record against his any day.” Harris began her remarks with praise for Biden, who opted to end his reelection bid and endorse Harris last weekend after his campaign fell into a tailspin following his disastrous June 27 debate performance against Trump. She called Biden’s legacy of accomplishment over the past three and a half years “unmatched in modern history.” Trump denigrated Harris as a “radical left lunatic” who wants to defund the police during a keynote address at a bitcoin conference in Nashville on Saturday. He said she was worse than Biden but was probably his second preference for a candidate to run against after Biden. Trump told the crowd of bitcoin supporters that he would embrace the cryptocurrency more than the Biden-Harris administration has and vowed to “replace the Biden-Harris economic stagnation” with an economic boom. The vice president told supporters at her Massachusetts fundraiser that her economic agenda would sharply contrast with Trump’s, who she claimed is squarely focused on lowering tax rates for wealthy Americans and improving the bottom lines of corporations. “Building up the middle class will be the defining goal of my presidency,” Harris said. She added, “Let us make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. Our campaign has always been about two very different visions for our nation.” Separately, the vice president’s office announced Harris would travel on Tuesday to Atlanta for a campaign event, and will head Thursday to Houston to attend a memorial service for Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, 74, a longtime Democratic House member who died on July 20. Jackson Lee, who had pancreatic cancer, helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence and recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday. ___ Associated Press writer Ali Swenson in New York contributed to this report.",

(AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris used her first fundraiser since becoming the Democrats’ likely White House nominee to excoriate the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as determined to roll back Americans’ freedoms.

The vice president told supporters at her Massachusetts fundraiser that her economic agenda would sharply contrast with Trump’s, who she claimed is squarely focused on lowering tax rates for wealthy Americans and improving the bottom lines of corporations. “Building up the middle class will be the defining goal of my presidency,” Harris said. She added, “Let us make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. Our campaign has always been about two very different visions for our nation.” Separately, the vice president’s office announced Harris would travel on Tuesday to Atlanta for a campaign event, and will head Thursday to Houston to attend a memorial service for Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, 74, a longtime Democratic House member who died on July 20. Jackson Lee, who had pancreatic cancer, helped lead federal efforts to protect women from domestic violence and recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

                    "text": "SAN DIEGO -- Marvel Studios kicked off its return to San Diego Comic-Con with dancing Deadpool variants and a choir for a panel that included news about the next two \"Avengers\" films and surprise guests, including Harrison Ford. Among the surprises: Robert Downey Jr. would return to Marvel's films, but not as Iron Man. He'll play the villain Victor Von Doom, or Doctor Doom, in one of the upcoming \"Avengers\" movies. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said that due to this weekend's success of \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" the sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe had now topped $30 billion in box-office earnings. In a nod to a scene in the movie, a choir sang Madonna's \"Like a Prayer\" before Feige spoke. \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" released Thursday, has already broken one record and could shatter more in its opening weekend. Feige used Saturday's panel to chart the course ahead for the MCU, revealing Ford's character in the next \"Captain America\" film and revealing \"Avengers: Secret Wars and \"Avengers: Doomsday\" as the titles of the next two films in the epic superhero team-up series. Feige said all the actors introduced Saturday would appear in the upcoming \"Avengers\" movies, which will be directed by Joe and Anthony Russo. The brothers guided the \"Avengers\" franchise through its sprawling storyline capped by \"Avengers: Endgame\" in 2019. The session comes after Marvel skipped the convention last year due to the Hollywood strikes, which prevented writers and actors from speaking on panels. Feige is being joined by several special guests, including stars of upcoming Marvel titles like \"Captain America: Brave New World,\" \"Thunderbolts(asterisk)\" and \"The Fantastic Four.\" The cast of \"Captain America: Brave New Wold\" - Tim Blake Nelson, Danny Rameriez, Giancarlo Esposito and Anthony Mackie - joined the stage first and teased details about the upcoming film. Esposito revealed that he will be playing the villain, Seth Voelker, also known as Sidewinder. The cast then stepped aside to share a scene from the movie on the big screen, which revealed that President Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross, played by Ford, is hoping to rebuild the Avengers with Mackie's Sam Wilson. It also showed Ford's character transform into the Red Hulk. Ford himself joined the panel after fans were treated to clips from the movie and flexed his muscles to the roaring crowd. The cast and director of \"Thunderbolts(asterisk)\" also surprised fans with a short clip from the movie. Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan and David Harbour (in full costume and speaking in character as the Red Guardian at first) stormed the stage and shared some more details about their characters. The film is slated to be released in May 2025. The final film teased at the panel was \"The Fantastic Four,\" starring Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach. The movie will begin filming on Tuesday in London, Feige said. He said the film will hit theaters in almost exactly one year in July 2025. Following a video director Matt Shakman created specifically for Comic-Con that featured the cast in full '60s glory, he and Feige revealed the official title of the film, \"The Fantastic Four: First Steps.\" Marvel already took over Hall H on Thursday with an electric panel celebrating \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" in which the audience was treated to a full screening and surprise guests joining stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman on stage. The mounting enthusiasm for the film at Comic-Con was reflected across the country as the fans rushed to see it in theaters, securing the film as the new record holder for the Thursday preview for an R-rated movie. The comic book film sold an estimated $38.5 million worth of movie tickets from preview screenings Thursday. The \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" success woke up a sleepy year for Marvel and assuaged worries about its box-office underperformance in late 2023. The superhero factory hit a record low in November with the launch of \"The Marvels,\" which opened with just $47 million.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will join their Japanese counterparts, Yoko Kamikawa and Minoru Kihara, at the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee, known as “2+2” security talks, to reaffirm their alliance following President Joe Biden 's withdrawal from the November presidential race. For the first time, the ministers will hold separate talks to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to “extended deterrence,” which includes atomic weapons — a shift from Japan’s earlier reluctance to openly discuss the sensitive issue in the world’s only country to have suffered nuclear attacks — amid growing nuclear threats from Russia and China. The ministers are expected to discuss plans to upgrade command and control structures for U.S. forces in Japan by bringing in higher-ranked officers with commanding authority to create a U.S. counterpart for Japan’s unified command currently set for inauguration in March. Japan is home to more than 50,000 U.S. troops, but a commander for the U.S. Forces Japan headquartered in Yokota in the western suburbs of Tokyo, tasked with managing their bases, has no commanding authority. Instead that comes from the Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii. The plan to upgrade USFJ’s command and control capability is designed to help smooth joint exercises and operations, officials say. Ahead of the 2+2 talks, Kihara was to meet with South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik in their first bilateral defense ministerial talks in Japan in 15 years. Austin will later join them for three-way talks. Japan has been accelerating its military buildup and has increased joint operations with the U.S., as well as with South Korea, while trying to strengthen its largely domestic defense industry. Japan has significantly eased its arms export restrictions and in December accommodated a U.S. request for shipment of surface-to-air PAC-3 missile interceptors produced in Japan under an American license to replenish U.S. inventories, which have decreased due to its support for Ukraine. The ministers are also expected to discuss increased Japanese production of PAC-3 interceptors for export to the United States. Japan and the U.S. have been accelerating arms industry cooperation following an April agreement between Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Biden. The two sides have set up working groups for missile co-production and for the maintenance and repair of U.S. Navy ships and Air Force aircraft in the region. While Japan's role is largely designed to help U.S. weapons supply and keep its deterrence credible in the Indo-Pacific amid continuing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, Japanese officials say it will help strengthen the Japanese defense industry.",

                    "text": "TOKYO (AP) — Japanese and U.S. defense chiefs and top diplomats agreed to further bolster their military cooperation by upgrading the command and control of U.S. forces in the East Asian country and strengthening American-licensed missile production there, describing the rising threat from China as “the greatest strategic challenge.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin joined their Japanese counterparts, Yoko Kamikawa and Minoru Kihara, at the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee in Tokyo, known as “2+2” security talks where they reaffirmed their bilateral alliance following President Joe Biden ‘s withdrawal from the November presidential race. Japan is home to more than 50,000 U.S. troops, but the commander for the U.S. Forces Japan headquartered in Yokota in the western suburbs of Tokyo, tasked with managing their bases, has no commanding authority. Instead, instructions come from the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii. The plans will give the USFJ greater capability while still reporting to INDOPACOM. The command upgrade “will be the most significant change to the U.S. Forces Japan since its creation and one of the strongest improvements in our military ties with Japan in 70 years,” Austin said. “These new operational capabilities and responsibilities will advance our collective deterrence.” “We are standing at a historic turning point as the rules-based, free and open international order is shaken to the core,” Kamikawa said. “Now is a critical phase when our decision today determines our future.” Austin, in his opening remarks, said China is “engaging in coercive behavior, trying to change the status quo in the East and South China Seas, around Taiwan and throughout the region,” adding that North Korea’s nuclear program and its deepening cooperation with Russia “threaten regional and global security.” In the joint statement issued after the talks, the ministers said China’s foreign policy “seeks to reshape the international order for its own benefit at the expense of others” and that “such behavior is a serious concern to the alliance and the entire international community and represents the greatest strategic challenge in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.” China has been at odds with many countries in the Asia-Pacific for years because of its sweeping maritime claims over the crucial South China Sea. It also claims self-governing Taiwan as its territory, to be annexed by force if necessary. In March, Beijing announced a 7.2% increase in its defense budget, already the world’s second-highest behind the United States, marking a massive military expansion. The ministers said the US command reorganization, set for March to be in line with Japan’s own command updating, aimed “to facilitate deeper interoperability and cooperation on joint bilateral operations in peacetime and during contingencies” and enhance intelligence coordination, surveillance, reconnaissance and cybersecurity. The new U.S. command in Japan will be led by a three-star general, not the four-star sought by Japan, but Austin said “we haven’t ruled that out” and will keep negotiating. Japan has long suffered from cybersecurity threats that Washington believes are of grave concern. Lately, Japan’s space agency revealed it suffered a series of cyberattacks, and though sensitive information related to space and defense was not affected, it has triggered worry and pushed the agency to pursue preventative measures. The ministers in a joint statement reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to “extended deterrence,” which includes atomic weapons — a shift from Japan’s earlier reluctance to openly discuss the sensitive issue, as the world’s only country to have suffered atomic attacks, amid nuclear threats from Russia and China. Japan has been accelerating its military buildup and has increased joint operations with the U.S. as well as South Korea while trying to strengthen its largely domestic defense industry.

The ministers said they will pursue efforts to expand Japanese production of PAC-3 interceptors for export to the United States, as well as co-production of Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles to meet “critical demand” for such systems to be ready when needed “to deter aggression.” Japan and the U.S. have also been accelerating arms industry cooperation following an April agreement between Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Biden. The two sides have set up working groups for missile co-production and for the maintenance and repair of U.S. Navy ships and Air Force aircraft in the region. While Japan’s role is largely designed to help U.S. weapons supply and keep its deterrence credible in the Indo-Pacific amid continuing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, Japanese officials say it will help strengthen the Japanese defense industry. Earlier Sunday, ahead of the 2+2 talks, Kihara met with Austin and South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik for their first trilateral defense talks hosted by Tokyo and signed a memorandum based on their June agreement in Singapore that institutionalizes their regular high-level talks, joint exercises and other exchanges. Defense officials said Sunday the memorandum serves as the basis for future defense cooperation among the three countries despite possible leadership changes while showcasing their unity. “The signing of this memorandum makes our trilateral cooperation unwavering even under changing global environments,” Kihara told reporters. Kihara also met Shin, the first South Korean defense chief to visit Japan in 15 years. They agreed to take steps to deepen their bilateral defense ties. (Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

                    "text": "TOKYO—Japanese and U.S. defense chiefs and top diplomats agreed to further bolster their military cooperation by upgrading the command and control of U.S. forces in the East Asian country and strengthening American-licensed missile production there, describing the rising threat from China as “the greatest strategic challenge.” Japan is home to more than 50,000 U.S. troops, but the commander for the U.S. Forces Japan headquartered in Yokota in the western suburbs of Tokyo, tasked with managing their bases, has no commanding authority. Instead, instructions come from the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii. The plans will give the USFJ greater capability while still reporting to INDOPACOM. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin joined their Japanese counterparts, Yoko Kamikawa and Minoru Kihara, at the Japan–U.S. Security Consultative Committee in Tokyo, known as “2+2” security talks where they reaffirmed their bilateral alliance following President Joe Biden ’s withdrawal from the November presidential race. “We are standing at a historic turning point as the rules-based, free and open international order is shaken to the core,“ Ms. Kamikawa said. ”Now is a critical phase when our decision today determines our future.” Mr. Austin, in his opening remarks, said China is “engaging in coercive behavior, trying to change the status quo in the East and South China Seas, around Taiwan and throughout the region,” adding that North Korea’s nuclear program and its deepening cooperation with Russia “threaten regional and global security.” In the joint statement issued after the talks, the ministers said the Chinese regime’s foreign policy “seeks to reshape the international order for its own benefit at the expense of others” and that “such behavior is a serious concern to the alliance and the entire international community and represents the greatest strategic challenge in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.” The Chinese communist regime has been at odds with many countries in the Asia-Pacific for years because of its sweeping maritime claims over the crucial South China Sea. It also claims self-governing Taiwan as its territory, to be annexed by force if necessary. In March, the Chinese regime announced a 7.2 percent increase in its defense budget, already the world’s second-highest behind the United States, marking a massive military expansion. The ministers said the U.S. command reorganization, set for March to be in line with Japan’s own command updating, aimed “to facilitate deeper interoperability and cooperation on joint bilateral operations in peacetime and during contingencies” and enhance intelligence coordination, surveillance, reconnaissance and cybersecurity. Japan has long suffered from cybersecurity threats that Washington believes are of grave concern. Lately, Japan’s space agency revealed it suffered a series of cyberattacks, and though sensitive information related to space and defense was not affected, it has triggered worry and pushed the agency to pursue preventative measures. The ministers in a joint statement reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to “extended deterrence,” which includes atomic weapons—a shift from Japan’s earlier reluctance to openly discuss the sensitive issue, as the world’s only country to have suffered atomic attacks, amid nuclear threats from Russia and China. Japan has been accelerating its military buildup and has increased joint operations with the United States as well as South Korea while trying to strengthen its largely domestic defense industry. Tokyo has significantly eased its arms export restrictions and in December accommodated a U.S. request for shipment of surface-to-air PAC-3 missile interceptors produced in Japan under an American license to replenish U.S. inventories, which have decreased due to its support for Ukraine.

Strands just moved out of beta, so it's now in the New York Times' official Games app, which might bring it more fans. I go into depth about the rules for Strands in this story. Need more answers? Here's the answer for today's Wordle, and here are the answers for today's Connections. And do you solve the NYT Mini Crossword? Here's today's answer for that. Read more: NYT Connections Turns 1: These Are the 5 Toughest Puzzles So Far Hint for today's Strands puzzle Today's Strands theme is: Daily delivery. If that doesn't help you, here's a clue: Extra, extra! Clue words to unlock in-game hints Your goal is to find hidden words that fit the puzzle's theme. If you're stuck, find any words you can. Every time you find three words of four letters or more, Strands will reveal one of the theme words. These are the words I used to get those hints, but any words of four or more letters that you find will work: PARE, REAP, SPAN, SPAR, SPARE, TIRE, LITE, BILE, CHOIR, RITE. Answers for today's Strands puzzle These are the answers that tie into the theme. The goal of the puzzle is to find them all, including the spangram, a theme word that reaches from one side of the puzzle to the other. When you've got all of them (I originally thought there were always eight but learned that the number can vary), every letter on the board will be used. Here are the nonspangram answers: GLOBE, HERALD, TIMES, TRIBUNE, JOURNAL, CHRONICLE. Today's Strands spangram Today's Strands spangram is NEWSPAPER. To find it, start with the N that's three letters in from the far left, and wind down. How to play NYT Strands 1. Use today's theme to look for words relating to that topic. See one? Drag or click the letters in order. Click on the last letter twice to submit your guess. If you've found a theme word, it'll light up in blue and stay that way. 2. Other words you find are considered hint words that give you clues to the theme words. Find three hint words (they must have at least four letters each), and the game will reward you by showing you a theme word. But if you can't unscramble it, find three more hint words and the game will highlight the theme word's letters in order. 3. Hunt for the spangram, a special theme word that spans the entire puzzle, though it could flow across or top to bottom. It summarizes the puzzle theme. 4. When you're done, you'll have used every letter on the board in either a theme word or spangram. Theme words fill the entire board and do not overlap.",
