        "body_text": "Title: A Brief Overview of our Furry Felines: Cats \n\nCats, also known as Felis catus, play a beloved role in countless households worldwide. These furry companions are valued for their easy maintenance, playful behavior, and often, their aloof charm, making them one of the most popular pet choices next to dogs.  \n\nCats are a highly diverse species with over 60 recognized breeds, each featuring distinct physical characteristics, temperaments, and health profiles. From the sleek, ebony-coated Oriental Shorthair to the grand, majestic Maine Coon, their diversity is simply astounding. Moreover, each cat, regardless of breed, has its unique personality traits, making them endearing and fascinating pets. \n\nUnknown to many, cats are essentially crepuscular creatures, meaning they are most active during dawn and dusk. Despite our domestic cats' indoor lifestyle, they retain this instinct from their far-off ancestors who used these times to hunt, avoiding bigger predators active during the day or night. Hence, your cat's sudden midnight sprint isn't random but a regular exercise of these primal instincts.\n\nCats have also significantly contributed to human well-being. Numerous studies highlight the therapeutic role of cats in reducing stress and anxiety, with their soft purrs and warm cuddles acting as effective natural relaxants. Moreover, owning a cat encourages responsibility in children and provides companionship for individuals of all ages, thereby improving emotional health.\n\nContrary to popular belief, a cat's purr isn't always a sign of contentment. They also purr when stressed, injured or unwell. Therefore, cat owners need to stay attuned to their pet's behavior, as these subtle signs could indicate potential health issues needing prompt attention.\n\nIn conclusion, cats are a fascinating mix of independence and companionship. They are low maintenance compared to other pets and offer unmatchable charm, making them a delightful addition to any family. They, like all pets, require attention and care to ensure they lead a happy, contented life. No wonder they have earned the title as one of man\u2019s favorite domestic companions.\n",

We squabbled over it, countries rushed in to claim it as their own, setting up research facilities to exploit its resources,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the truth is, this new element belongs to all of us. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Adamantium. It\u2019s in a secure location, and we have own own Captain America to thank for that.\u201d Later, when Ross speaks with Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) aka Captain America, he tells him that he knows \u201cwe haven\u2019t always agreed in the past, but what you\u2019ve accomplished has made me reconsider.\u201d This, he says, \u201cis why I want you to help me rebuild the Avengers. The country needs this. Work with me, Sam. We\u2019ll show the world a better way forward.\u201d Directed by Julius Onah, Brave New World follows Anthony Mackie\u2019s Sam Wilson (previously known as The Falcon), watching as he\u2019s recruited by newly elected U.S. President Thaddeus \u201cThunderbolt\u201d Ross (Harrison Ford) to fill the Captain vacancy post Chris Evans\u2019 Steve Rogers and become a U.S. agent. Brave New World marks the fourth installment of the Captain America franchise and the first since Evans bid adieu to the MCU in 2019\u2019s Avengers: Endgame. Introduced as Wilson in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Mackie then went on to play the part in 2015\u2019s Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, as well the Emmy-nominated Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, where he first assumed the mantle of Captain America. Dalan Musson and Malcolm Spellman each penned drafts of Captain America: Brave New World, with Matthew Orton more recently being hired to pen additional scenes and material. In addition to Mackie and Ford, the film stars Danny Ramirez, Shira Haas, Xosha Roquemore, Carl Lumbly, Giancarlo Esposito, Liv Tyler and Tim Blake Nelson. Kevin Feige and Nate Moore produced, with Louis D\u2019Esposito and Charles Newirth serving as executive producers. Today\u2019s Marvel news comes at a time when the studio has begun recalibrating, lifting the pressure to produce as much content as possible with a new mandate of two films per year. Already past the release of Phase Five titles Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and The Marvels, with Deadpool & Wolverine currently in theaters, the studio has set Thunderbolts* to wrap up that cycle on May 5, 2025. Opening with The Fantastic Four on July 25, 2025, Phase Six will also feature Blade (November 7, 2025), Avengers 5 (May 1, 2026), and Avengers: Secret Wars (May 7, 2027).

You can find them here: ForbesToday's 'Wordle' #1134 Hints, Clues And Answer For Saturday, July 27thBy Erik Kain I figured, since it\u2019s Sunday and all and we\u2019re doing our best to be lazy, that we could take a stroll down memory lane and see what big, earth-shattering events took place on this day\u2014July 28th\u2014throughout history. Turns out it\u2019s been kind of a crazy day, with executions of prominent leaders, the opening shots of major wars and other pretty wild events. Behold: 1540 - Thomas Cromwell, a chief minister to King Henry VIII of England, was executed. 1794 - Maximilien Robespierre, a key figure in the French Revolution, was executed by guillotine. 1821 - Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn declared the independence of Peru from Spain. 1868 - The 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution was certified, granting citizenship to formerly enslaved people. 1914 - Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, marking the beginning of World War I. 1945 - A B-25 bomber crashed into the 79th floor of the Empire State Building in New York City. 1958 - The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created by the National Aeronautics and Space Act. 1976 - The Tangshan earthquake struck in China, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. 1996 - The Centennial Olympic Park bombing occurred during the Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. Let\u2019s hope this July 28th is less interesting! And let\u2019s do this Wordle! How To Solve Today\u2019s Wordle The Hint: A useful garment for painters. The Clue: This Wordle has far more consonants than vowels. Okay, spoilers below! . . . The Answer: Today's Wordle Can you solve today\u2019s phrase? Play Now Credit: Erik Kain Wordle Analysis Every day I check Wordle Bot to help analyze my guessing game. You can check your Wordles with Wordle Bot right here. I didn\u2019t realize how lucky my opening guess was until I read the Wordle Bot analysis later, but if I\u2019d known I only had 12 words left I might have done things differently. As it stands, CHORE left me in a pretty good spot and I effectively squandered that with my next guess\u2014appropriately, the word SCOWL. This did slash the number of remaining solutions down to just 3, and gave me a green \u2018S\u2019 but apparently three was too many, and STOIC was not the right choice. It did, however, leave me with just one remaining solution: SMOCK for the win! Huzzah! Competitive Wordle Score I get zero points for guessing in 4 but I do get one point for beating the Bot, who took five tries today (having guessed SHOCK on its fourth guess). Huzzah for humanity! How To Play Competitive Wordle Guessing in 1 is worth 3 points; guessing in 2 is worth 2 points; guessing in 3 is worth 1 point; guessing in 4 is worth 0 points; guessing in 5 is -1 points; guessing in 6 is -2 points and missing the Wordle is -3 points. If you beat your opponent you get 1 point. If you tie, you get 0 points. And if you lose to your opponent, you get -1 point. Add it up to get your score. Keep a daily running score or just play for a new score each day. Fridays are 2XP, meaning you double your points\u2014positive or negative. You can keep a running tally or just play day-by-day. Enjoy! Today\u2019s Wordle Etymology The word \"smock\" has an interesting etymology that traces back through several languages and centuries. Old English: The term \"smock\" comes from the Old English word \"smoc,\" which referred to a garment worn by women and later by men as an undergarment or a protective outer garment. Germanic Roots: The Old English \"smoc\" is derived from the Proto-Germanic word \"*smukkaz,\" which means \"a garment.\" This Proto-Germanic word is also the root of similar words in other Germanic languages, such as Middle Low German \"smocke\" and Old High German \"smoccho.\" Proto-Indo-European: The ultimate origin is thought to be the Proto-Indo-European root \"*smeug,\" which means \"to slip\" or \"to creep.\" This root suggests the idea of a garment that slips over the head and body, reflecting how a smock is typically worn. The word \"smock\" has evolved in meaning over time but has consistently referred to a type of loose-fitting garment used for protection or modesty. In modern usage, it often refers to a loose outer garment worn to protect clothes while working.

        "body_text": "Few TV leads can say they endured more to get into character than Colin Farrell, the handsome leading man who endured 3 1/2 hours of makeup every day to transform into the unrecognizable Oz Cobb for The Penguin. Now the fruit of all those hours sitting in the makeup chair is about to bloom, with the show getting the closeup at San Diego Comic-Con during a prime Saturday spot. HBO used the event to launch a new trailer for the show, which launches Sept. 19 on HBO and Max and received huge applause after it played to the Comic-Con crowd. The series was initially set to be a Max original but moved under the HBO umbrella \u2014 meaning it will both run on the cable channel and stream on Max \u2014 as part of a branding and strategy shift. The Penguin marks an expansion of the universe of The Batman, the 2022 hit that starred Robert Pattinson and which introduced the world to Oz Cobb, the aspiring crime boss who rises to rule the Gotham underworld as The Penguin. Farrell appeared virtually, with other panelists including Cristin Milioti (Sofia Falcone), Rhenzy Feliz (Victor Aguilar), executive producer Reeves, showrunner Lauren LeFranc and executive producer Dylan Clark. As for the future, The Batman II is on the horizon for 2026, and it\u2019s possible there could be more TV shows set in this universe. The Penguin hails from Warner Bros. Television and DC Studios, the new arm run by James Gunn and Peter Safran. Reeves\u2019 6th & Idaho Productions and Dylan Clark Productions are also behind the project, which also stars Michael Kelly (Johnny Viti), Shohreh Aghdashloo (Nadia Maroni), Deirdre O\u2019Connell (Francis Cobb), Clancy Brown (Salvatore Maroni), James Madio (Milos Grapa), Scott Cohen (Luca Falcone), Michael Zegen (Alberto Falcone), Carmen Ejogo (Eve Karlo) and Theo Rossi (Dr. Julian Rush).

But we\u2019re talking about \u201cThunderbolts,\u201d which had some light shed on it during Marvel\u2019s Hall H panel at San Diego Comic-Con this year. The movie reunites \u201cBlack Widow\u201d stars Florence Pugh and David Harbor as Yelena Belova and Red Guardian respectively, and teams them up with a whole slew of Marvel returners, including Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Wyatt Russell, Sebastian Stan, Hannah John-Kamen and Olga Kurylenko, plus newcomer Geraldine Viswanathan (filling the role previously held by \u201cThe Bear\u201d star Ayo Edebiri, who had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts caused by Hollywood\u2019s double strike). For those unfamiliar, in the comics, the Thunderbolts team is similar to DC Comics\u2019 Suicide Squad in that it is a team of villains completing dangerous missions for the government. In the Comic-Con-exclusive footage, which was soundtracked to \u201cWhere Is My Mind\u201d by Pixies, Yelena is seen knocking down Red Guardian\u2019s door \u2014 she\u2019s there to recruit him. Plenty of action was teased, including as hallway fight with Pugh and Russell\u2019s US Agent firing at Yelena. Ghost (John-Kamen) joins in, but they\u2019re forced to work together because someone is trying to kill them. \u201cEventually you start to realize there are bad guys. And worse guys,\u201d Pugh\u2019s Yelena says. Ahead of the footage reveal, Harbour, Pugh, Russell, Stan and Louis-Dreyfus all took the Hall H stage, with Harbour dressed in full Red Guardian costume. In a bit, he pretended to be angry his costars didn\u2019t get his email about dressing up. The film\u2019s title does technically include an asterisk \u2014 it\u2019s called \u201cThunderbolts*\u201d \u2014 but when pressed as to what the asterisk means, Feige replied, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to see the movie.\u201d Harbour and Pugh previously worked together on \u201cBlack Widow,\u201d and the \u201cStranger Things\u201d actor had high praise for reuniting with the \u201cMidsommar\u201d actress. \u201cI had one of the greatest experiences of my life working on this movie with this group of people, they\u2019re all wonderful but I had a favorite,\u201d he said. Pugh described the film as \u201cso wonderful and bizarre and very brave.\u201d \u201cThunderbolts\u201d was originally slated for release this month, but filming was pushed back due to the strikes.

        "title": "Donald Trump, JD Vance see capacity crowd for first joint rally in Minnesota",
        "body_text": "ST.CLOUD - Supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance enthusiastically stood for hours in withering heat Saturday to get into the ticket's first Minnesota rally of this election season, chanting \"USA!\" and \"Fight, fight, fight!\" as they pumped their fists in eager anticipation. Vance was greeted with loud applause and kicked off 20 minutes of remarks, saying the ticket \"stands with Israel,\" mentioning the rocket attack on a school on the country's northern border as an example of the bad things that can happen when Trump isn't president. The Ohio senator talked about how Trump \"wiped the debate stage\" with President Joe Biden, and suggested the crowd \"thank President Trump for getting rid of Joe Biden once and for all.\" Then he pivoted to attacking the media; when the crowd booed, Vance said: \"They deserve it.\" He said the media had covered for Biden and now compares Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King when she is really a \"card-carrying member of the San Francisco lunatic fringe.\" He talked about saving the country for \"Americans of every race, color and creed.\" Vance said Harris owns \"every failure\" of the Biden administration, referring to her repeatedly as the \"border czar\" who would give free health care and college tuition to undocumented immigrants. \"She wants to hand over control of our country to people who shouldn't be here in the first place,\" he said. Then speaking directly to those he called \"illegal aliens,\" Vance said: \"Start packing your bags now.\" The crowd launched into a spontaneous chant of \"USA! USA!\" Before Vance spoke, U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., warmed up the crowd and enthused about the GOP turning Minnesota red in a presidential election for the first time since 1972. The House majority whip jabbed Gov. Tim Walz, who reportedly is on the short list for consideration to join Harris on the ticket. \"Walz is an empty suit who should not be allowed anywhere near the White House,\" Emmer said. A capacity crowd of 8,000 filled the Herb Brooks National Hockey Center; hundreds took up standing-room-only spots on what would be the ice sheet in the arena on the St. Cloud State University campus. The first supporters lined up to get in at 2 a.m. As 6 p.m. approached, hundreds \u2014 if not thousands \u2014 remained outside in muggy 90-degree weather in a line that snaked for blocks. They were either turned away or left on their own to watch the rally on an outdoor screen. The most popular outfits included flag-themed attire and red MAGA hats, metallic gold shoes and all sorts of campaign T-shirts. One bore an image of the White House and read \"Stolen Property,\" and another had Trump's mugshot with the line, \"I'm voting for the Convicted Felon.\" Debi Rancour, 68, of St. Michael, Minn., arrived hours early in support of Trump's views on the Southern border and what she called his faith-based conservatism. \"This is on my bucket list. It's a dream come true,\" she said of the rally, her first. Rancour also said she thinks the 2020 election was stolen, a belief espoused by Trump that has been proved false. \"I've got a hat right here,\" she said. \"It says, 'Trump Won.'\" Her sister, Janet Rancour, 66, of Champlin, said she's excited for a second Trump term. \"We didn't get to see what Trump could do last time because they were so worried about getting him out,\" she said. Cynthia Gail, 66, a teacher from Albert Lea, said she respects Trump for persisting. \"I'm not proud of some of his past but there's such a thing as forgiveness,\" she said. \"And nobody else is going to be able to tackle the tasks to protect the United States.\" Despite the energy in St. Cloud, Minnesota Republicans have a steep hill to climb with Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket. A KSTP-TV poll on Friday showed Harris leads Trump by 10 percentage points in the state, a gap larger than Biden had before announcing he was stepping down from the race. Earlier Saturday, DFLers gathered in St. Paul to hear from Walz before knocking on doors for Harris. As he has done in recent days, the governor sharply targeted the GOP ticket. \"This is the beautiful tapestry of America and not one damn stupid red hat amongst you,\" he told the crowd of volunteers. Jumping on the hockey theme, Walz said Trump was \"here today in the State of Hockey to complete his trifecta: He lost in '16; he lost in '20; he loses in '24.\" In St. Cloud, Tim Tuuri, 66, of White Bear Lake said he came to see Trump, Vance and GOP-endorsed U.S. Senate candidate Royce White. \"We just want to be out here with our fellow patriots who love our country,\" Tuuri said. Taylor Hill, 24, of Sartell, Minn., arrived at 6 a.m. and secured a shaded waiting spot, where she set up a tent and card table. \"I'm excited to hear [Trump] unfiltered, not through the media,\" Hill said. \"You can't get more from the horse's mouth than here.\" Hill said she knows Trump is divisive, but \"in our political climate, we need someone who is decisive and powerful.\" Army veteran Allen Zierden of Albany, Minn., was in line at 11 a.m. He said he's concerned about the economy and gas prices. \"Trump's chances of flipping Minnesota are higher than Harris winning the election,\" Zierden said, adding that he'd hate to see Walz on the Democratic ticket. Everett Duckworth drove to St. Cloud from Fargo for his first Trump rally. The 62-year-old said he belongs to the Sons of Liberty, a group that works to increase awareness about the government \"infringing on the constitutional rights, freedoms and liberties of its people.\" He said he wants to bring the movement to Minnesota. \"It's so encouraging to see Republicans doing what they need to do to make a difference,\" Duckworth said. \"If we're going to do it, it's going to be this year. I think we've got a good shot.\" Michelle Hoeper of Villard, Minn., said she came to the rally \"to show people here in Minnesota, maybe even those who are just driving by, that there are more people here that support [Trump], maybe more than they realize.\" Staff writer Kyeland Jackson contributed to this story.",

        "title": "Yankees Rumors: Latest Trade Buzz After Jazz Chisholm Jr. Deal with Marlins",
        "body_text": "The New York Yankees do not appear intent on settling after the Jazz Chisholm Jr. trade. Andy Martino of SNY reported that the Yankees are staying \"active in trade conversations\" and are looking to fill other needs on the team. \"After trading for Jazz Chishom Jr., the Yankees remained active in trade conversations on multiple fronts,\" Martino wrote. \"Upon acquiring Chisholm, the Yanks expected to take advantage of his versatility, but it's worth noting that the positions that Chisholm has played in the majors -- second base, shortstop, and center field -- are well-covered by current Yankees personnel.\" Martino listed relievers Tanner Scott, Jason Adam and Pete Fairbanks as players New York has called for, and starter Jameson Taillon was another named floated as a potential trade target. Scott is currently with the Miami Marlins and has been dominant in the bullpen. He has a 6-5 record with a 1.18 ERA in 45.2 innings. His non-inclusion in the Chisholm trade could signal that the Yankees are out on him, but he does remain on the market and is someone the team could look back to. Adam and Fairbanks are both with the division rival-Tampa Bay Rays and New York should be very familiar with the two. Adam has a 4-2 record with a 2.49 ERA in 47 innings while Fairbanks has a 2-3 record with a 3.19 ERA in 36.2 innings. Taillon would be a familiar face as he spent two seasons with the Yankees prior to joining the Chicago Cubs in 2023. He is 7-5 with a 2.96 ERA in 100.1 innings in 2024 and has two seasons remaining on his contract. The Yankees are 60-45 and own the top Wild Card spot in the American League. New York is just 1.5 games behind the Baltimore Orioles for the AL East lead and the addition of Chisholm should bolster the infield depth. While this could be viewed as a solid position to be in heading into the later stages of the season, it is disappointing after the team's strong start. New York had the best record in baseball during the earlier stages of the season and entered July with a 54-32 record. The team has gone just 6-13 in July and lost its hold on the division. The team is at risk of falling further down the standings and replenishing the roster at the deadline could be what is needed to get the Yankees back on track.

Following the verdict, Marvel fired him, and hasn\u2019t indicated how they might fill the hole in their universe until now. \u201cAvengers: The Kang Dynasty\u201d and \u201cAvengers: Secret Wars\u201d were first announced back in 2022, once again during Marvel\u2019s Hall H panel. \u201cThe Kang Dynasty\u201d was set to hit theaters on May 2, 2025, with \u201cSecret Wars\u201d following on Nov. 7, 2025.

        "body_text": "Former President Donald Trump made waves after urging his Christian followers to vote for him in the upcoming presidential election \"just this time\" \u2014 and saying that they \"won't have to do it anymore\" if he wins. During an event on Friday, July 26, hosted by the conservative Christian organization Turning Point Action, Trump, 78, addressed the crowd and implied that if he were to be voted in, \"everything\" would be \"fixed,\" according to multiple sources, including Rolling Stone and The Hill. \"Christians, get out and vote, just this time,\" Trump said as the crowd in West Palm Beach, Fla., cheered, per the outlets. \"You won\u2019t have to do it anymore,\" he said. \"Four more years, you know what, it will be fixed, it will be fine. You won\u2019t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians.\" \u201cI love you Christians. I\u2019m a Christian. I love you, get out, you gotta get out and vote. In four years, you don\u2019t have to vote again, we\u2019ll have it fixed so good you\u2019re not going to have to vote,\" Trump continued. At the same event, Trump also claimed that he would \"once again appoint rock-solid conservative judges who will protect religious liberty,\" per Rolling Stone. In a statement shared by Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign team on Saturday concerning what they called \"Trump\u2019s vow to end democracy,\" Harris for President spokesperson James Singer said: \"When Vice President Harris says this election is about freedom, she means it.\" \"Our democracy is under assault by criminal Donald Trump: After the last election Trump lost, he sent a mob to overturn the results,\" Singer continued. \"This campaign, he has promised violence if he loses, the end of our elections if he wins, and the termination of the Constitution to empower him to be a dictator to enact his dangerous Project 2025 agenda on America,\" he added. Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Many Democrats have criticized Trump's rhetoric around the 2020 election, and specifically his claims of voter fraud, after he was defeated by President Joe Biden, as well as the recent Supreme Court decision allowing for presidential immunity for any official acts taken during their time in the White House. Biden, 81, previously cited the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot as one reason that the ruling set a \"dangerous\" precedent because the power of the presidential office \"will no longer be constrained by the law.\" \"[The] American people must decide if they want to entrust the president \u2014 once again, the presidency to Donald Trump, now knowing he\u2019ll be even more emboldened to do whatever he pleases whenever he wants to do it,\" Biden said in a speech earlier this month.",

        "title": "US-Japan security talks focus on bolstering military cooperation amid rising China threat",
        "body_text": "TOKYO -- Japanese and U.S. defense chiefs and top diplomats will meet in Tokyo on Sunday for talks aimed at further bolstering their military cooperation, including by upgrading the command and control of U.S. forces and strengthening American-licensed missile production in Japan, amid a rising threat from China. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will join their Japanese counterparts, Yoko Kamikawa and Minoru Kihara, at the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee, known as \u201c2+2\u201d security talks, to reaffirm their alliance following President Joe Biden 's withdrawal from the November presidential race. For the first time, the ministers will hold separate talks to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to \u201cextended deterrence,\u201d which includes atomic weapons \u2014 a shift from Japan\u2019s earlier reluctance to openly discuss the sensitive issue in the world\u2019s only country to have suffered nuclear attacks \u2014 amid growing nuclear threats from Russia and China. The ministers are expected to discuss plans to upgrade command and control structures for U.S. forces in Japan by bringing in higher-ranked officers with commanding authority to create a U.S. counterpart for Japan\u2019s unified command currently set for inauguration in March. Japan is home to more than 50,000 U.S. troops, but a commander for the U.S. Forces Japan headquartered in Yokota in the western suburbs of Tokyo, tasked with managing their bases, has no commanding authority. Instead that comes from the Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii. The plan to upgrade USFJ\u2019s command and control capability is designed to help smooth joint exercises and operations, officials say. Ahead of the 2+2 talks, Kihara was to meet with South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik in their first bilateral defense ministerial talks in Japan in 15 years. Austin will later join them for three-way talks. Japan has been accelerating its military buildup and has increased joint operations with the U.S., as well as with South Korea, while trying to strengthen its largely domestic defense industry. Japan has significantly eased its arms export restrictions and in December accommodated a U.S. request for shipment of surface-to-air PAC-3 missile interceptors produced in Japan under an American license to replenish U.S. inventories, which have decreased due to its support for Ukraine. The ministers are also expected to discuss increased Japanese production of PAC-3 interceptors for export to the United States. Japan and the U.S. have been accelerating arms industry cooperation following an April agreement between Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Biden. The two sides have set up working groups for missile co-production and for the maintenance and repair of U.S. Navy ships and Air Force aircraft in the region. While Japan's role is largely designed to help U.S. weapons supply and keep its deterrence credible in the Indo-Pacific amid continuing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, Japanese officials say it will help strengthen the Japanese defense industry.",

One piece of legislation pointed out that Alito had allowed an upside-down American flag to be flown at his house following the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. \"By displaying this flag, he showed support for domestic enemies of the United States, some of whom engaged in an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol building, in violation of his Constitutional Oath of office,\" the bill said. The bill argued Alito should have recused himself in several cases involving former President Donald Trump and Jan. 6 defendants. \"Since a \u2018stop the steal\u2019 symbol first flew on a flagpole outside Justice Alito\u2019s home, it has been reasonable to question Justice Alito\u2019s ability to impartially adjudicate matters related to the January 6 insurrection,\" Ocasio-Cortez's legislation explained. Separate legislation presented by Ocasio-Cortez said Thomas should be impeached for failing to disclose gifts. \"Over the course of at least 15 years, Justice Thomas and his wife, Virginia 'Ginni' Thomas, have received gifts of significant value from Harlan Crow without reporting the source, description, and value of such gifts,\" the bill insisted. EXCLUSIVE:Trump\u2019s \u2018secretary of retribution\u2019 has a \u2018target list\u2019 of 350 people he wants arrested \"By accepting but failing to disclose multiple gifts of luxury vacations and travel, Justice Thomas has undermined the impartiality and integrity of the Supreme Court in violation of the public trust,\" the legislation added. \"Wherefore, Justice Thomas, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial and removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.\" The bill also noted that Thomas had participated in \"numerous proceedings concerning challenges to the outcome of the 2020 Presidential election\" despite his wife's activism in support of former President Donald Trump's \"Stop the Steal\" movement. \"Justice Thomas\u2019s impartiality in the aforementioned proceedings might reasonably be questioned because Mrs. Thomas actively participated in contemporaneous political and legal efforts to overturn Mr. Trump\u2019s defeat in the 2020 Presidential election,\" the legislation said.",

        "title": "Opening statements to give roadmap to involuntary manslaughter case against Alec Baldwin",
        "body_text": "A jury is set to hear opening statements Wednesday at the involuntary manslaughter trial of Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer, a trial that will delve into the confluence of gun safety, high-wattage celebrity and a low-budget Western movie on a remote ranch set. Prosecutors and defense attorneys selected 16 jurors \u2014 11 women and five men \u2014 on Tuesday, seating a jury from a region with strong currents of gun ownership and safety informed by backcountry hunting. Four of the jurors will be deemed alternates while the other 12 deliberate once they get the case. The shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, a 42-year-old rising star in her craft, nearly three years ago sent shock waves through the film industry and led to one felony charge against Baldwin that could result in up to 18 months in prison. Baldwin has pleaded not guilty as he returns to the desert Southwest for the trial at a downtown courthouse in Santa Fe, a short drive from the movie-ranch setting of scenes from \u201cRust.\" Baldwin has claimed the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware that it was loaded with a live round, he said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 not the trigger \u2014 and it fired. Prosecutors say they'll present evidence that Baldwin went \u201coff script\u201d and failed to follow basic industry standards for firearms safety when he pointed the firearm at Hutchins on Oct. 21, 2021. \u201cAt the end of the day, the prosecutor\u2019s main theory is that this was a gun involved, and Baldwin had a gun in his hand, and it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a film set or hunting safety class, you\u2019re responsible for what comes out of the end of the barrel,\u201d said John Day, a Santa Fe-based defense attorney and former prosecutor. Baldwin attorney Alex Spiro probed prospective jurors on Tuesday for strong opinions about gun safety and asked whether a person must entirely take responsibility for whether a gun is loaded or may \u201crely on experts, does anybody have a problem with that?\u201d Most who answered said they always treat a gun as if it were loaded. Baldwin, the star of \u201cBeetlejuice,\u201d \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross\u201d and \u201c30 Rock\u201d who has been a household name as an actor and public personality for more than three decades, also served as co-producer on \u201cRust,\u201d which had an initial budget of roughly $7.5 million \u2014 a low figure by labor union standards. Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer ruled shortly before trial that his producer status is not relevant to the case. Workplace safety investigators and prior court testimony confirmed two gun misfires on set before the fatal shooting, while six crew members walked off set on the eve of Hutchins' death over concerns including hotel accommodations and safety. Marlowe Sommer put a summary of those findings off-limits at the request of prosecutors, who describe that investigation as unreliable. In court filings, defense attorneys have highlighted that the armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, already has been found responsible for the shooting, along with testimony that the gun had been checked by an assistant director before it was handed to Baldwin \u2014 and that the shooting was incomprehensible and shocking to the entire movie crew because of their belief that there was no live ammunition on set. Gutierrez-Reed is serving an 18-month prison sentence as she appeals her conviction in March on a charge of involuntary manslaughter. Prosecutors cast blame on her for allowing live rounds to make their way onto the film set undetected, in a trial that also highlighted video of Baldwin rushing weapons supervisors to reload his revolver and waving the gun as a pointing stick. Prosecutors have two alternative standards for proving the charge. One is based on the negligent use of a firearm. The other is proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Baldwin acted with total disregard or indifference for the safety of others. Testimony at trial will delve into shortcomings in a final safety check of the gun before Baldwin began rehearsing with it, as well as the mechanics of the weapon and whether it could have fired without a trigger pull. The live bullet that killed Hutchins also wounded director Joel Souza. Day says that Baldwin's insistence that he never pulled the trigger, first voiced in a December 2021 interview with ABC News, narrows the options for the defense at trial. \u201cBecause he said that to George Stephanopoulos, the defense has got to try to show that, well, the gun will just go off if you look at it funny,\" Day said. \u201cThey've also got to bring in experts on the film business who can say, \u2018You know, if somebody hands an actor a gun and tells him it\u2019s safe, then he should believe them.'\u201d Los Angeles-based civil defense attorney Mark Sedlander said it's unusual for an accidental workplace death to reach criminal trial but that the fatal shooting on \u201cRust\u201d touches on fundamental safety concerns in the workplace. \u201cThis is a case about a woman who was tragically killed while she was at work, away from her family, doing her job, just like Americans across this country, and she went to work one day and she never came back,\u201d said Sedlander of the Mancini Shenk law firm. Prosecutors initially dismissed an involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin in April 2023, saying they were informed the gun might have been modified before the shooting and malfunctioned. A more recent analysis of the gun commissioned by prosecutors concluded the \u201ctrigger had to be pulled or depressed sufficiently to release the fully cocked or retracted hammer.\" Defense attorneys contend that destructive testing of the gun by the FBI that broke pieces of the firing mechanism may have destroyed evidence that could possibly exonerate Baldwin. ___ Dalton reported from Los Angeles.",

The name and number that could seen on the back of jerseys worn throughout the hot concrete streets of New York City in the buildup to this Copa America semifinal pitting Argentina against Canada. It was mostly on display on the back of Argentina jerseys, but there was the occasional Inter Miami shirt to be found, perhaps more than might be expected, and evidence of his impact on the Major League Soccer franchise. Those hoping to glimpse Lionel Messi in action were not disappointed. Lautaro Mart\u00ednez went into this game as the tournament\u2019s top scorer, and its most productive striker, but had to settle for a place on the bench as coach Lionel Scaloni chose Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lavarez to partner Messi in attack from the start. What made this game even more intriguing was that Canada has had something about it in this tournament. It has had to to get this far, knocking out an impressive Venezuela in the quarterfinals, and generally troubling opposition sides with their counter-attacking and counter-pressing. They were also the one remaining Concacaf nation of the six invited to this Conmebol tournament. Canada showed from the off that it might trouble Argentina. Jacob Shaffleburg had a couple of early sights at goal, managing to get relatively free down the left-hand side.

The more threatening attacking play certainly came from the team in red in the opening 20 minutes. But it was Argentina who grabbed the opening goal, swiftly and almost out of nowhere. The quality of the chance was mostly down to the weight and direction of \u00c1lvarez\u2019s first touch. Rodrigo De Paul\u2019s direct through-pass from midfield seemed to be heading to \u00c1varez\u2019s left, but his sticky touch took it to his right and away from Canada defender Mo\u00efse Bombito. It was then slotted past Maxime Crepeau. EAST RUTHERFORD, NEW JERSEY - JULY 09: Julian Alvarez of Argentina is challenged by can1during the ...

(Photo by Elsa/Getty Images) Getty Images Messi looked like he had decided this would be the game in which to score his first goal of the tournament. He drifted a shot wide early on and later turned Alistair Johnston inside out before shooting right-footed just wide of the near post. Jonathan David tested Emiliano Martinez\u2019s concentration from close range at the near post just before halftime from a Johnston throw but Canada still lacked the ability to create a clear-cut chance. There seemed to be some confusion when Messi's goal eventually came. Many in attendance, even those of an Argentinian persuasion seemed to merely acknowledge the goal rather than celebrate it. The stadium camera still picking out members of the crowd rather than having returned to the action on the field to show the goal probably contributed to the muted reaction. Messi turned the ball in the net, diverting Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s shot, and any subsequent questions asked about the goal deemed it fine. It turned out Derek Cornelius played Messi onside when the shot was hit by Fern\u00e1ndez. NEW YORK, US - JUNE 25: Argentinian football fans gather in Times Square on June 25, 2024 after ...

Canada was an awkward opponent but didn\u2019t have the quality in the final third. Even when substitute Tani Oluwaseyi had the best of Canada\u2019s chances late on, he couldn\u2019t find the net. Argentina, on the other hand, is not the World Cup winner and defending Copa America champion by accident. It has quality all across the pitch and has one of the greatest of all time in its ranks still performing at a high level even at 37.

        "title": "Biden will meet Wednesday with top union leaders as he seeks to reassure worried Democrats",
        "body_text": "Facing pressure from within his own party to abandon his reelection campaign, President Joe Biden is relying on labor unions to help make the case that his record in office matters more than his age. The 81-year-old Democrat is set to meet Wednesday with the executive council of the AFL-CIO, America's largest federation of trade unions. The AFL-CIO said the president has been booked to attend the meeting for more than a year, but his participation now involves much higher scrutiny after his weak debate performance against Donald Trump raised fears about his ability to compete in November's election. His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders. A person who has been involved in past executive council meetings described them as largely informal and unscripted, a sign that Biden will not be able to rely on a prepared text as he seeks to solidify support among a group of union leaders who are both loyal to his administration and pragmatic. The person insisted on anonymity to preview the private meeting. SEE ALSO: Biden dismisses diminishing poll numbers, low approval rating after debate A White House official, insisting on anonymity to preview the meeting, said that Biden intends to thank the union leaders for their support and outline his plans for the future. Biden is close to many union leaders who will be in the room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend. The council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members. So far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate. But some statements of support are also worded diplomatically to suggest a degree of flexibility in case Biden chooses to drop out - saying they back the Biden-Harris administration and not just Biden personally. \"President Biden and Vice President Harris have always had workers' backs - and we will have theirs,\" Shuler, the AFL-CIO president, said after the debate. After Biden was interviewed by ABC News last week in the aftermath of his poor debate, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, posted on X: \"Biden is an incredible President and tonight we saw that he's on top of the details. He has my support and we're ready to keep working for Biden-Harris to win in November.\" SEE ALSO: 5 takeaways from striking Biden-Trump presidential debate Some union leaders have been more targeted in their support for Biden and his continued candidacy. United Steelworkers International President David McCall said before Wednesday's meeting that his union \"proudly supports\" Biden, saying that his \"record of delivering for working people stands for itself.\" Kenneth Cooper, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was also firmly behind Biden, saying that his union members \"couldn't ask for a stronger advocate.\" Wednesday's meeting has become a test of the union movement's strategy to emphasize Biden's policy agenda as a way to overcome doubts about his candidacy. Biden routinely holds his events at union halls. He has conversed regularly with several of the union leaders at Wednesday's meeting, knowing that the group is a key link at the local level to the voters that he says make him the Democrats' best candidate in November. Over the course of his term, Biden has tied his administration to the idea that labor unions built the middle class. He visited a picket line during the auto strikes, backed the steelworkers union in objecting to Nippon Steel taking over U.S. Steel, saved pensions for union workers as part of his pandemic aid and sided with unions on a new rule to make more workers eligible for overtime pay. Biden is so mindful of union workers that he recently canceled a speech planned for the conference of the National Education Association in Philadelphia after the union's staff announced a strike and formed a picket line. One person familiar with the labor movement's thinking said there is an acknowledgment that Biden lost some ground among voters after the debate, but the unions have found that one-on-one conversations about Biden's agenda are mattering more to members and their families than his age and health. Their pitch is that Biden's agenda has directly helped union workers while Trump's plans could leave them worse off. The AFL-CIO has raised 42 specific objections to Trump's time as president from 2017 to 2021. It noted that the Republican, who recently proposed making tips paid to workers tax-free, had also as president implemented a proposal to let bosses pocket their employees' tips, among other concerns about his tax cuts and efforts to restrict unionization. Trump has also made a play for union members, having met in January with officials in the Teamsters Union and saying afterward that although Republicans generally don't get backing from organized labor, \"in my case it's different because I've employed thousands of Teamsters and I thought we should come over and pay our respects.\" The former president has portrayed himself as supporting blue-collar workers, with the Teamsters president Sean O'Brien later saying that there's \"no doubt\" that Trump enjoys some support from union members. O'Brien is scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee at Trump's invitation. In 2020, AP VoteCast found that 16% of voters came from union households and 56% of them supported Biden. Biden and Trump essentially split non-union households in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, meaning that the Democrat's edge with union households was likely a critical factor in his victory.",

        "title": "George Clooney Pens Op-Ed Calling for Biden to Step Aside",
        "body_text": "On Wednesday, The New York Times op-ed section published a blunt essay from George Clooney, where the actor and director, one of Hollywood\u2019s more engaged political players, forcefully argues for President Joe Biden to step aside in his campaign for reelection and allow a new candidate to take on Donald Trump in November. Clooney, who has starred in and directed several politically minded films over his career, did not mince words in the essay, writing that the Biden he spent time with at the fundraiser that the Hollywood A-lister threw three weeks ago is not the same man who won in 2020, but is the one 51 million Americans saw with their own eyes at his disastrous debate performance on June 27. \u201cWas he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe,\u201d Clooney wrote of the debate performance that has sent Democrats into a panic and that is now dividing the party. \u201cBut our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn\u2019t see what we just saw. We\u2019re all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we\u2019ve opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\u201d The Oscar winner for the political thriller Syriana and nominee for Good Night and Good Luck, which follows the conflict between journalist Edward R. Murrow and U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy, floated the idea of several prominent Democrats stepping up to lead the ticket in November. Clooney suggests in the essay that the nominating process at the 2024 Democratic National Convention could \u201cenliven our party and wake up voters.\u201d He concludes: \u201cJoe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.\u201d More to come.",

        "title": "Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 Hands-On: Bigger Battery, Better Camera And AI",
        "body_text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 Prakhar Khanna Alongside the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Samsung also announced the Galaxy Z Flip 6 at its July Unpacked event. Last year with the Galaxy Z Flip 5, the company introduced a major redesign, so it\u2019s focusing on under the hood upgrades with the new flip phone. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 features meaningful upgrades like better camera hardware and packing a bigger battery in a similar design. Galaxy Z Flip 6 Features Subtle But Useful Design Upgrades Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen Prakhar Khanna At first glance, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 might seem the same as the Flip 5, but there are a few noticeable changes. For instance, the camera module now features the same color as the body, giving it a bolder look. Like the Galaxy Z Fold 6, the Flip 6 sports flatter sides as well. These give it a boxier but comfortable in-hand feel. At 85.1 x 71.9 x 14.9mm folded and 165.1 x 71.9 x 6.9mm unfolded, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is slimmer than its predecessor but weighs the same 187 grams. I got to play around with it for 30 minutes, and it felt like a light but premium phone. The back has a nicer feel to it, too. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is also IP48 dust and water-resistant, as opposed to the IPX8 rating on the Flip 5. This means the new Samsung flip phone is protected against a limited amount of dust ingress (particles measuring 1mm or more) at 4, whereas the Flip 5 didn\u2019t feature dust resistance. It\u2019s also protected against water with its 8 rating, which means it can withstand immersion in water up to 1m for a limited time. Similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 6, the Flip 6 no longer features a deep crease on the folding display. It has a new hinge design that helps minimize the crease while keeping the sturdiness intact. In my hands-on time, I noticed the crease only in certain lighting conditions. It\u2019s much better than the Galaxy Z Flip 5 crease. MORE FOR YOU NYT \u2018Strands\u2019 Hints, Spangram And Answers For Wednesday, July 10th Northern Lights Alert: Beware \u2018Head-On\u2019 Aurora Displays Say Scientists \u2018The Acolyte\u2019 Episode 7 Recap And Review: Woo-Hoo, Witchy Woman Better Performance And Bigger Battery Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 Galaxy AI Prakhar Khanna The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 \u201cfor Galaxy\u201d chipset, paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB or 512GB of storage. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 gets a RAM boost alongside the processor upgrade. If the Galaxy S24 is any indication, you should expect great performance and good battery life on the new Flip \u2014 more so because it packs a bigger, 4,000mAh battery (vs 3,700mAh on Flip 5). It\u2019s the same cell capacity as the Galaxy S24, so I\u2019m hoping to see an improvement over the Galaxy Z Flip 5\u2019s battery life. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 should also provide better gaming performance for longer sessions because Samsung has added a vapor cooling chamber for the first time to its Flip lineup. Meaningful Camera Upgrades And AI Galaxy Z Flip 6 Flex mode camera autofocus Prakhar Khanna The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 sports a new camera setup. You get a 50MP primary camera with dual-pixel autofocus and an 85-degree field of view, which is a significant upgrade over the aging 12MP camera found on the Flip 5. It is accompanied by a 12MP ultrawide camera with a 123-degree field of view, which remains the same as before. Samsung has also added meaningful AI upgrades to the camera. For instance, it can now recognize your position and zoom in or out for the best framing choice. The Auto Zoom feature will zoom in automatically if you are nearer to the frame and zoom out when farther away. Like the Galaxy Z Fold 6, you get an AI-powered Portrait Mode that uses AI to clear outlines, create authentic facial expressions, and produce natural bokeh. Another useful AI feature is Interpreter: Conversation mode, where the outer display shows the translated conversation to the other person while the inner display shows the translation from their language to yours. Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6: Everything Else Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 Prakhar Khanna The Galaxy Z Flip 6 features the same 3.4-inch Super AMOLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate and a 6.7-inch Full HD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 2,640\u00d71,080 resolution. It introduces a new feature called interactive wallpaper on the cover screen that responds to touch and movement. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 also includes a Photo Ambient feature on the cover screen, which changes based on the time and weather. You get all other AI features found on the Fold 6, such as Photo Studio, sketch-to-image generation, and more. The 4,000mAh battery charges at the same 25W speed, which is rated to reach 50% charge in 30 minutes. You also get support for wireless charging and wireless power sharing. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and 5G with both nano SIM and eSIM. Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6: Price and Availability Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 colors Prakhar Khanna The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 has received a price bump, now starting at $1,100. Pre-orders are open, and it will be available for sale starting July 24 alongside the other new Galaxy devices.

        "title": "Microsoft quits OpenAI board seat as antitrust scrutiny of AI partnerships intensifies",
        "body_text": "Microsoft has relinquished its seat on the board of OpenAI, saying its participation is no longer needed because the ChatGPT maker has improved its governance since being roiled by boardroom chaos last year. In a Tuesday letter, Microsoft confirmed it was resigning, \u201ceffective immediately,\u201d from its role as an observer on the artificial intelligence company\u2019s board. \u201cWe appreciate the support shown by OpenAI leadership and the OpenAI board as we made this decision,\u201d the letter said. The surprise departure comes amid intensifying scrutiny from antitrust regulators of the powerful AI partnership. Microsoft has reportedly invested $13 billion in OpenAI. European Union regulators said last month that they would take a fresh look at the partnership under the 27-nation bloc\u2019s antitrust rules while British competition watchdogs have also been looking into the deal. Microsoft took the board seat following a power struggle in which OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was fired, then quickly reinstated, while the board members behind the ouster were pushed out. \u201cOver the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company\u2019s direction,\u201d Microsoft said in its letter. \u201cGiven all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.\u201d With Microsoft\u2019s departure, OpenAI will no longer have observer seats on its board. \u201cWe are grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the Board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership,\u201d OpenAI said in a statement. It\u2019s not hard to conclude that Microsoft\u2019s decision to ditch the board seat was heavily influenced by rising scrutiny of big technology companies and their links with AI startups, said Alex Haffner, a competition partner at U.K. law firm Fladgate. \u201cIt is clear that regulators are very much focused on the complex web of inter-relationships that Big Tech has created with AI providers, hence the need for Microsoft and others to carefully consider how they structure these arrangements going forward,\u201d he said. OpenAI said it would take a new approach to \u201cinforming and engaging key strategic partners\u201d such as Microsoft and Apple and investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, with regular meetings to update stakeholders on progress and ensure stronger collaboration on safety and security.",

When MSNBC co-host Jonathan Lemire pointed this out to Pelosi, the former House speaker responded: \u201cI want him to do whatever he decides to do.\u201d \u201cWhatever he decides, we go with,\u201d she said before pivoting, \u201cAnd I\u2019ve said to everyone, let\u2019s just hold off whatever you\u2019re thinking. Either tell somebody privately, but you don\u2019t have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week. But I\u2019m very proud of the president.\u201d House Democrats huddled in a closed-door caucus meeting on Tuesday morning at Democratic National Committee headquarters to discuss their party leader\u2019s future, with senior lawmakers re-emerging hours later to back Biden.

        "body_text": "George Clooney, a lifelong Democrat and prominent donor to Joe Biden, joined the growing chorus of those calling for Biden to step aside for another nominee in this year\u2019s presidential election in a New York Times op-ed on Wednesday. \u201cThe one battle he cannot win is the fight against time,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cNone of us can.

Clooney cited intense concerns about Biden\u2019s age, comparing his experience with the President at other fundraising events over the years. \u201cIs it fair to point these things out? he continued. \u201cIt has to be. This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed.\u201d Clooney just recently participated in a fundraiser for the Biden-Harris campaign, using his appearance for a contest of small-dollar voters to win a chance to attend the fundraiser and meet the actor and others.

        "body_text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Don\u2019t let their small size fool you\u2014the best personal blenders are kitchen workhorses. Though not quite as powerful or versatile as full-size models, these countertop devices can whip up fruit smoothies, creamy pesto and emulsified sauces in a matter of seconds. After testing nine top-rated models over the course of a month, I\u2019m confident the Nutribullet Pro 900 is the best model for most home cooks, thanks to its ease of use, powerful motor and reasonable price. Five personal blenders impressed during testing, including the Nutribullet Pro 900 and the Beast ... [+] Blender. Illustration: Forbes / Image: Retailers Here are the very best models, based on my testing: Best Personal Blender Overall: Nutribullet Pro 900 Best Budget Personal Blender: Ninja Fit Best Upgrade Personal Blender: Beast Blender Tonal Best Portable Blender: Cuisinart EvolutionX Cordless Compact Blender Best-Designed Personal Blender: Zwilling Enfinigy Personal Blender Ideal for smaller portions, personal blenders have a lot in common with standard blenders\u2014they just come in a more compact package. Most models can hold between 16 and 32 ounces and come with multiple cups, as well as to-go lids and other accessories. \u201cIt\u2019s my go-to gadget,\u201d says cookbook author Carissa Stanton, who uses a personal blender every day for smoothies (as well as the occasional dip and sauce). \u201cIt\u2019s also easy to store when you don\u2019t want to have it out on the counter.\u201d Recipe developer and food editor Fatima Khawaja, who relies heavily on personal blenders as a private chef, appreciates being able to refrigerate pulverized mixtures right in the modest-sized blender cups, then reblending days after if the mixture separates or she wants to make a bit more. Simply put, there\u2019s a lot to love about these pint-sized kitchen appliances. Ahead, find the standout models that impressed me the most during testing. Best Personal Blender Overall A Best-Selling Model With A Powerful 900-Watt Motor Amazon Nutribullet Pro 900 Volume: 32 ounces | Dimensions: 7.7 x 12 x 15.9 inches | Weight: 4.7 pounds | Wattage: 900 watts | Additional pieces: Two blending cups with to-go lids, two handled lip rings, two cup rings, recipe book Best for: Powerful, efficient blending Those who appreciate a simple, straightforward interface Blending large servings at once Skip if: You want a blender that\u2019s less than $100 You want an extra-lightweight blender While testing the most popular personal blenders, I wasn\u2019t surprised that a Nutribullet model\u2014part of a brand that considers itself a pioneer in the space\u2014earned the highest marks overall. Featuring a 32-ounce volume, which can accommodate two single-serving smoothies at once, this blender offers great versatility at a reasonable price. Not only did it blend smoothies with ease, but it made a creamy pesto and a lovely vinaigrette. A smoothie made in the Nutribullet Pro 900. Rebecca Firkser Equipped with a 900-watt motor, this blender was one of the least powerful I tested, but I found it to be just as efficient as models with more wattage. It was also a breeze to use. To operate it, fill the cup, screw on the lid with the blades, invert the whole thing and press it into the base, then twist into place to start running. The result: automatic, hands-off blending. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s not difficult to pulse with this blender. Though it doesn\u2019t have a dedicated button, like some newer Nutribullet models, you can easily twist and untwist the blending cup to start and stop the machine. I also found it easy to clean, as the wider cup was especially easy to fit a sponge into. Alongside the motor base and blades, the Nutribullet comes with two cups, two to-go lids, two lip rings with handles, two cup rings for sipping and a recipe book. Simply put, this Goldilocks of a personal blender would prove a worthy addition to any kitchen. Another nice perk: Whereas most personal blenders come in just black or silver, the base of the Nutribullet comes in more than 10 colors, including both matte and metallic hues. (For more details, check out my in-depth review of the Nutribullet Pro 900.) The 2024 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards are here: Explore our 150 top-recommended items across categories after extensive research and testing. Best Budget Personal Blender A Reliable Pick For Less Than $60 Amazon Ninja Fit Volume: 16 ounces | Dimensions: 4.3 x 4.3 x 13 inches | Weight 3.1 pounds | Wattage: 700 watts | Additional pieces: Two blending cups with to-go lids, recipe book Best for: Pulsed sauces like pesto Powerful, efficient blending Easily moving from cabinet to countertop Skip if: You want to walk away while blending You want a quiet model You\u2019re looking for a more aesthetically pleasing blender Affordable and extra compact, the Ninja Fit blew me away during testing, as it kept up with models twice its price. It sailed through every culinary challenge, and the pesto in particular was especially great: It came out evenly chopped and not overly emulsified. Though some might find its 16-ounce volume to be limiting, I was able to make a sizable one-serving smoothie and plenty of crushed ice for a few drinks. It\u2019s also very lightweight, which made it a snap to assemble and get blending. The main downside to this model is that you have to continuously hold down on the cup to activate the motor\u2014meaning you have to stand over the blender while it runs, which is relatively loud. It\u2019s also not exactly the best-looking, highest-quality option out there. (Its base is made from shiny black plastic, and its overall design isn\u2019t anything special, which is to say the look fits the price of this one.) That said, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a more powerful, efficient personal blender for less than $60. It comes with two plastic blending cups with to-go lids, two cup rings, two handled lip rings and a recipe book. Best Upgrade Personal Blender An Ultra-Powerful, Intuitive Model That\u2019s Worth The Price Amazon Beast Blender Tonal Volume: 33.8 ounces | Dimensions: 4.9 x 4.9 x 15.8 inches | Weight: 6.7 pounds | Wattage: 1,000 watts | Additional pieces: Two blending cups (33.8 ounces and 16.9 ounces), two storage lids, drinking lid, two straws, straw cap, two cleaning brushes, stainless steel bottle Best for: Well-emulsified smoothies A one-minute hands-free blending option Blending large servings at once Making creamy sauces like Caesar dressing and mayonnaise Skip if: You want a small, lightweight personal blender You\u2019re content making smoothies in your high-powered blender You don\u2019t care about extra features For those who are willing to spend extra for a premium blender that\u2019s as pretty as it is powerful, the Beast Blender Tonal is worth the splurge. Featuring a 1,000-watt motor, this model aced all its tests, producing ultra-creamy smoothies and sauces. I also appreciate that the blending vessels are made from Tritan, an ultra-durable material that\u2019s BPA-free, and that the included accessories are actually useful: Along with two blending cups (33.8 ounces and 16.9 ounces), a stainless steel bottle and various lids, the blender comes with a brush for cleaning the blade, two reusable straws and a straw cleaner. The Beast Blender is so strong, the pesto is made was almost too creamy. Rebecca Firkser What sets this blender apart (other than its sharp look) is what the brand refers to as its \u201cblade with a brain.\u201d Whereas other models with auto-blend settings would run for 30 or 45 seconds and then stop, the Beast\u2019s single one-minute cycle pauses the motor and adjusts as needed to agitate the ingredients, making for a better emulsion. (It also keeps track of the internal temperature.) Among the biggest fans of this function is Stanton, who uses a Beast blender every day to make a smoothie. \u201cUsually, if I\u2019m going to be blending something, I\u2019ll blend it and then I\u2019ll take the lid off and shake it to make sure nothing gets stuck and I don\u2019t have any chunks,\u201d she says. With the Beast blender, that type of intervention is rarely necessary. Not only did it yield a beautiful vinaigrette, as it quickly blitzed the shallot, but the pesto also came out extra smooth, if not a little too smooth. (Here\u2019s my full Beast Blender review.) Best Portable Blender An On-The-Go Pick That Says, \u2018No Outlet? No Problem\u2019 Amazon Cuisinart EvolutionX Cordless Compact Blender Volume: 16 ounces | Dimensions: 3.5 x 3.9 x 11.7 inches | Weight: 2.2 pounds | Voltage: 7.4 volts | Additional pieces: Two lithium batteries, USB charging cable, plastic cup with travel lid Best for: Dorm rooms, offices and other indoor spaces that may not have easily accessible outlets Blending outdoors Skip if: You\u2019re more interested in a blender\u2019s performance than whether it has to be plugged in You want a bigger blending vessel Designed for on-the-go use, portable blenders have a lot in common with standard personal blenders\u2014the main difference is that they\u2019re battery-powered. They also tend to be less powerful, which is why this Cuisinart EvolutionX impressed me so much during testing. Not only did it make a fine smoothie (though it was slightly icy), but it also crushed ice with ease and produced a very decent pesto. Though it doesn\u2019t have the power of plug-in personal blenders, the perk of this model is that it can be used truly anywhere, from the campsite to the dorm room to the gym. The main downside to this blender\u2014and all portable models, for that matter\u2014is you have to remember to charge it. The EvolutionX comes with two lithium batteries and a USB charging cable, and to reach full battery, you need to charge it for two hours; once fully charged, it offers 20 minutes of continuous runtime. Though that might not seem like the longest time, just think about how long it takes to whip up a smoothie (not that long). Lastly, whereas the blending jar and motor on most portable models don\u2019t come apart, which makes drinking out of the vessel awkward and cleaning more difficult, the parts on this model detach. Best-Designed Personal Blender A Pick That\u2019s Easy To Use And Lovely To Look At Amazon Zwilling Enfinigy Personal Blender Volume: 20 ounces | Dimensions: 5.4 x 5.4 x 14 inches | Weight: 4.4 pounds | Wattage: 500 watts | Additional pieces: Tritan cup with plastic to-go lid, seal lid Best for: Making a quick smoothie with easy cleanup, and taking the cup on the go Those who want to leave their personal blender on the kitchen counter Efficient ice crushing and blending for smoothies and other drinks Skip if: You\u2019d rather have something cheaper You\u2019re willing to spend a bit more on the upgrade pick The Zwilling Enfinigy Personal Blender is my best-designed pick for two reasons: It\u2019s intuitive to use and good-looking. Straight out of the box, the blender was a breeze to operate. Using the control wheel on the front of the machine\u2019s base, you choose between two straightforward settings: smoothie and pulse. Once you\u2019re done blending, the 20-ounce Tritan cup\u2014which is sleek and modern\u2014is comfortable to grip, thanks to its slim, roughly rectangular design and ribbed exterior. (The interior is smooth.) Lastly, the stainless steel blades on this model are serrated to help cut through tough ingredients. One important thing to note: The Enfinigy has one of the weaker motors of the blenders that I tested, coming in at 500 watts. As a result, it doesn\u2019t always produce perfectly smooth blends. When I used the auto-blend smoothie function, some ice came out unblended, and a few pieces of kale didn\u2019t come out fully chopped in the pesto. All things considered, though, I still think this is a great personal blender\u2014especially for those interested in an attractive model to keep out on their countertop. All the winning personal blenders. Rebecca Firkser MORE FROMFORBES VETTED Samsung Unpacked 2024 Debuts New Foldable Phones, A Smart Ring And More By Christian de Looper Contributor Casper One Mattress Review: Comfort With A New And Improved Design By McKenzie Dillon Forbes Staff Other Personal Blenders I Tested I tested four other blenders that didn\u2019t make my winners\u2019 list, though I should note that they all worked decently well. In fact, if you\u2019re drawn to one of the models below and it suits your budget and blending needs, I don\u2019t think you can go wrong with any of the ones I tested. Nutribullet Ultra: Featuring a 1,200-watt blender, the Nutribullet Ultra is the brand\u2019s newest, most advanced model. During testing, I appreciated the blender\u2019s relatively quiet operation, as well as its construction: It\u2019s made from Tritan Renew, a partially recycled version of the ultra-durable plastic. Though I don\u2019t think this model is overpriced, I think the less expensive Nutribullet Pro 900 is just as effective and versatile, which is why it scored slightly higher than the Ultra. Our Place Splendor Blender: The recently released Our Place Splendor Blender\u2014which costs $125\u2014was neck and neck with the Beast model in every culinary test, performing on par or just below it. The blenders also share somewhat of a similar design: They have an hourglass shape, ribbed container and heavy base to support a 1,000-watt motor. That said, the Beast ultimately outperformed it, as the Our Place model\u2019s pesto was a little chunky, and its smoothie was slightly loose. Magic Bullet: Like many people, I first learned of Magic Bullet through infomercials, though I\u2019d never actually used one before testing. Though I wasn\u2019t disappointed by this blender, I wasn\u2019t blown away by it either. It made a good smoothie (with some bits of unchopped ice) but not the best pesto: It struggled to chop the ingredients at first, though it eventually overblended them. Still, considering its low price, I think home cooks who want an affordable, easy-to-store model for making smoothies would be happy with this one. Ninja Blast Portable Blender: The Ninja Blast was one of two portable blenders I tested, and it made a decent smoothie and crushed ice. I found it to be a little awkward, though. The base doesn\u2019t detach from the blending cup, meaning you have to drink from the blender on its base or pour the smoothie into a cup. Lastly, though the blender was fairly powerful, it needed a good amount of liquid to get things going, so it struggled with the pesto test. How I Tested The Best Personal Blenders After unboxing each blender, I considered each model\u2019s overall quality and design, as well as the additional pieces included. Then, because personal blenders are typically associated with smoothies, I started by making one in each. I used frozen blueberries, fresh banana, fresh spinach, chia seeds, milk and two ice cubes. I observed how long it took the model to blitz the ingredients into a smooth, drinkable blend. (If the blender had an automatic smoothie function, I used it as many times as needed until it looked blended.) Next, I removed the blade, screwed on the to-go lid and shook the cup to see if it leaked. I then took a sip to test how easy it was to drink from the to-go lid. Lastly, I strained the remaining smoothie through a fine-mesh sieve to see if any ingredients came out large or chunky. Ice pulverized in the Nutribullet Pro 900. Rebecca Firkser Once that test was completed, I made raw kale pesto (with olive oil, toasted almonds, garlic, finely grated Parmesan and lemon juice) to test each blender\u2019s ability to break down fibrous leafy greens and hard nuts. During this test, I noted which models finely chopped the pesto into a uniformly chunky sauce, as opposed to simply turning it into an ultra-emulsified savory smoothie. I then pulsed ice and water in each blender to see which were capable of making crushed ice, which you might want for cocktails or other drinks. To wrap up, I made a vinaigrette in the best-performing blenders, as each expert I consulted said they love using the countertop devices for salad dressing. (I used olive oil, red wine vinegar, shallot and Dijon mustard.) I also assessed the ease of cleaning throughout. After the smoothie test, I rinsed each blender cup with hot water, then ran the cup (and to-go lid, if listed as dishwasher-safe) through the dishwasher. Then, I hand-washed the blades and other remaining pieces, according to each brand\u2019s directions. After the pesto test, I rinsed each blender cup and blade with hot water, added a cup of room-temperature water and a small pump of dish soap to the cup, screwed the blade back on and then ran the blender again for 30 seconds to \u201cself-clean\u201d the vessel. After rinsing out the soapy water with hot water, I air-dried the pieces. Then, I smelled the cups to see if any had residual garlic odor. How To Pick A Personal Blender Thinking of adding one of these compact blenders to your arsenal of kitchen devices? Here are the most important factors to keep in mind as you shop. Capacity Most personal blenders can accommodate between 16 and 32 ounces, making them ideal for whipping up small batches of a smoothie, salad dressing, pesto and more. If you want the option to make smoothies for two, for example, opt for a model on the higher end of that range. Just keep in mind that the larger the capacity, the more cabinet space the piece requires. If you\u2019re concerned about storage, ask yourself these questions, offered by Khawaja: \u201cHow much space is this going to take on my counter? Is there room in my cabinet? Is it going to be too tall so I\u2019ll have to put it sideways in my cabinet, or does it disassemble in two parts and I can put it side by side?\u201d Power \u201cI\u2019ll always look at the wattage,\u201d says food stylist Drew Aichele, who says he\u2019s \u201cpretty brutal\u201d with his personal blender, using it often for blended margaritas and finely grating firm cheese. Most personal blenders fall in the range between 175 watts and 1,000 watts. If you want a blender that can handle ice and other frozen foods, it\u2019s best to opt for a higher wattage. Otherwise, you might need to break up food into smaller chunks or pieces for the blender to process completely. Ease Of Use And Cleaning If a personal blender is challenging to put together, annoying to blend or a pain to clean, there\u2019s a good chance you won\u2019t find yourself reaching for it in the kitchen. While most personal blenders operate hands-free (once you lock the cup into place, the model runs), some more basic models have cups that need to be held in place for the machine to work. The latter does offer more control\u2014think of using the \u201cpulse\u201d function on a food processor\u2014though it\u2019s objectively less convenient. Additionally, if you don\u2019t like to hand-wash your dishes, check to make sure the model you\u2019re eyeing has dishwasher-safe parts. Price Generally speaking, a personal blender will set you back anywhere between $50 and $150, though some models fall outside this range. (Smeg, for instance, has a retro-inspired model that retails for $170.) Models from direct-to-consumer brands like Beast and Our Place are typically more expensive, as they\u2019re designed with both aesthetics and performance in mind. Less souped-up models from brands like Magic Bullet and Ninja, on the other hand, are comparatively inexpensive. Additionally, the higher the capacity, the more expensive the model tends to be. If you\u2019re just looking for something basic to make single-serving smoothies and the occasional pesto or dressing, you can likely get away with a less powerful and more affordable model. My Expertise I\u2019m a writer, recipe developer, recipe tester, food stylist and culinary producer with nearly a decade of experience, and I\u2019ve worked for Food52, Bon App\u00e9tit, Epicurious, Taste, the Strategist and NYT Cooking (among other food publications). For Forbes Vetted, I\u2019ve tested and reviewed the best carbon steel pans, and I wrote an accompanying cleaning guide. I also\u2014and this is relevant to this article\u2014have used quite a few blenders throughout my career, from standard versions to immersion blenders. I also spoke with three experts in the food industry who regularly use blenders in myriad styles. Carissa Stanton, author of the cookbook Seriously, So Good, uses a personal blender every day and has discovered the tool often fits her culinary needs more than upright blenders or food processors. (She loves to make extra-creamy hummus in her personal blender.) Drew Aichele is a food stylist who uses a personal blender for finely grating Parmesan cheese and whipping up cr\u00eape batter. Fatima Khawaja is a chef and food editor who\u2019s gotten to know her way around the countertop device through her experience as a personal chef; some of her clients only own personal models, not upright or immersion blenders, so she\u2019s adapted recipes to fit the equipment. How Powerful Are Personal Blenders? Personal blenders are unlikely to be as powerful as upright blenders, especially high-powered models. Because there\u2019s no way to vent a personal blender, they can\u2019t be used for hot liquids like soup, whereas upright blender lids typically have a venting method. That said, personal blenders have their strengths. Because of their small size, they\u2019re typically lighter in weight, easier to store and simpler to wash. What Are The Disadvantages Of Personal Blenders? The main difference between standard blenders and personal models is their size: The former have larger capacities, allowing you to make bigger batches of food. Additionally, personal blenders do not offer ventilation, so they cannot be used to blend hot ingredients. Lastly, some models (especially higher-wattage ones) can cost as much as\u2014if not more than\u2014no-frills standard blenders.

        "title": "Kevin Costner&#8217;s &#8216;Horizon 2&#8217; Pulled From August Release in Theaters (Exclusive)",
        "body_text": "Kevin Costner\u2018s period Western Horizon: An American Saga \u2014 Chapter 2 won\u2019t be riding into theaters on Aug. 16 after all. The film is being pulled from the release calendar after Horizon: An American Saga \u2014 Chapter 1 bit the dust in its theatrical debut late last month. After numerous discussions, Costner\u2019s Territory Pictures and distribution partner New Line Cinema made the decision to switch-up their ambitious release plan in hopes of allowing more time to grow the audience for the first film. The first Horizon sports a $100 million price tag. As part of that attempt, Chapter 1 will debut in the home on Premium VOD July 16 in addition to still being available to watch in theaters. \u201cTerritory Pictures and New Line Cinema have decided not to release Horizon: Chapter 2 on August 16 in order to give audiences a greater opportunity to discover the first installment of Horizon over the coming weeks, including on PVOD and MAX. We thank our exhibition partners for their continued support as moviegoers across the US discover the film in its theatrical run,\u201d a New Line spokesperson said. Added Territory Pictures in a separate statement, \u201cThe audience response to Horizon, and enthusiasm for seeing our story continue in Horizon 2, has been incredibly gratifying. Kevin made this film for people who love movies and who wanted to go on a journey. The support that we have received from film fans, and the theater owners, as they experience the first chapter of this saga only serves to reinforce our belief in them and the films that we have made, and we thank them for coming on board for the ride. We welcome the opportunity for that window to be expanded as we know it will only serve to enhance the experience of seeing Horizon 2.\u201d A debut date for Max has not yet been announced. Warner Bros., New Line\u2019s parent company, began notifying theater owners of the dramatic 11th hour change on Wednesday morning. Many cinemas had offered consumers the chance to buy advance tickets for Chapter 2; they will now have to be refunded. The Horizon series marks a major gamble for Costner, who put $38 million of his own money into Chapter 1 and funded the rest with the help of two mystery investors and by selling off foreign rights. New Line and Warners agreed to distribute and market the first two movies for a fee, with Costner ponying up for the marketing. Costner intends on making four films. Horizon Chapter 1, sporting a running time of three hours and one-minute, opened to just $11 million over the June 28-30 weekend. It was an alarming debut for the $100 million movie, which was hampered by a poor B- CinemaScore and tepid reviews (it has a 43 percent critics\u2019 rating on Rotten Tomatoes). It tumbled 51 percent in its second weekend to $5.4 million for a 10-day domestic total of $22 million. Worse, it\u2019s earned less than $3 million overseas. Chapter 2 likewise cost roughly $100 million to make. Costner\u2019s team indicated last week that he intends to resume shooting Chapter 3 in August. Costner is known for his confidence, but even he shocked Hollywood when he announced he would direct for the first time in decades and make four Horizon movies chronicling the great migration West during the Civil War era. In April, Warner Bros. signed on as a distributor and announced the unprecedented plan to release the first two films less than two months apart. Costner was so invested, that he left his hit show Yellowstone amid his Horizon commitments. Costner believed his film would strike a nerve in America\u2019s heartland \u2014 just as Yellowstone has \u2014 and while it indeed played best in the mountain regions, Midwest, South and South central states, it so far has failed to galvanize his fans or Yellowstone viewers to the desired degree. The marketing campaign crafted by Warner Bros. centered heavily on Costner, who toured across the country, as well as premiering the film at the Cannes Film Festival. The studio also leveraged sister companies that are part of Warner Bros. Discovery, including TNT sporting events and TCM. So far, there\u2019s no word as to when Horizon Chapter 2 will return to the theatrical calendar. Warner Bros. and New Line did not pick up distribution rights to the third and fourth movies.",

        "title": "Judge says Rudy Giuliani bankruptcy case likely to be dismissed. But his debts aren\u2019t going away",
        "body_text": "By MICHAEL R. SISAK NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A judge said Wednesday he was leaning toward throwing out Rudy Giuliani \u2018s bankruptcy case after lawyers for the cash-strapped former New York City mayor and his biggest creditors \u2014 two ex-Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment against him \u2014 agreed this was the best way forward. The case has been roiled by allegations Giuliani is flouting bankruptcy laws and potentially hiding assets. A dismissal would end his pursuit of bankruptcy protection, but it wouldn\u2019t let him off the hook for his debts. His creditors could pursue other legal remedies to recoup at least some of the money they\u2019re owed, such as getting a court order to seize his apartments and other assets. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane said he plans to issue a decision by the end of the week. He scheduled a hearing for 1 p.m. Friday and could make his ruling at that time. Lane ruled out converting the case to a liquidation, as Giuliani had recently requested, saying that doing so would not be in the best interest of people and entities he\u2019s indebted to. \u201cI\u2019m leaning toward dismissal frankly because I\u2019m concerned that the past is prologue,\u201d Lane said during a hybrid in-person and Zoom status hearing in White Plains, New York. Giuliani\u2019s lawyer, Gary Fischoff, said dismissing the case would allow him to pursue an appeal in the defamation case, which arose from his efforts to overturn Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 election loss. A lawyer for the former election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss, accused Giuliani of using the bankruptcy process as a \u201cbad-faith litigation tactic\u201d and said \u201che regards this court as a pause button on his woes.\u201d Lane scolded Giuliani at one point for interrupting the hearing. The ex-mayor, joining by phone, called Freeman and Moss lawyer Rachel Strickland\u2019s comments \u2014 including remarks about his many legal woes \u2014 \u201chighly defamatory, your honor.\u201d Philip Dublin, a lawyer for a committee of Giuliani\u2019s other creditors, said the committee would rather keep the bankruptcy case going with the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee. Giuliani filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in December, days after the former election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss, won their defamation case. They said Giuliani\u2019s targeting of them because of Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election being stolen led to death threats that made them fear for their lives. Earlier this month, Giuliani requested that his Chapter 11 bankruptcy case be converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation \u2014 which would have seen a trustee appointed to take control of his assets and sell many of them off to help pay creditors. Reconsidering that idea on Wednesday and pushing for a dismissal instead, Fischoff noted that administrative fees related to liquidation would \u201cconsume if not 100%, a substantial portion of the assets.\u201d If the bankruptcy is dismissed, Freeman and Moss could bring their effort to collect on the $148 million award back to the court in Washington, D.C., where they won their lawsuit, and avoid having to pay more legal fees for bankruptcy court. Lane said a dismissal would include a 12-month ban on Giuliani filing again for bankruptcy protection. Freeman and Moss, meanwhile, have a pending request before the judge to declare that the $148 million judgment cannot be discharged \u2014 or dismissed \u2014 during Giuliani\u2019s bankruptcy. The bankruptcy is one of a host of legal woes consuming Giuliani. Last week, the former federal prosecutor was disbarred as an attorney in New York after a court found that he repeatedly made false statements about Trump\u2019s 2020 election loss. He is also facing the possibility of losing his law license in Washington after a board in May recommended that he be disbarred. In Georgia and Arizona, Giuliani is facing criminal charges over his role in the effort to overturn the 2020 election. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases. When he filed for bankruptcy, Giuliani listed nearly $153 million in existing or potential debts, including almost $1 million in state and federal tax liabilities, money he owes lawyers, and many millions of dollars in potential judgments in lawsuits against him. He estimated he had assets worth $1 million to $10 million. In his most recent financial filings in the bankruptcy case, he said he had about $94,000 cash in hand at the end of May while his company, Giuliani Communications, had about $237,000 in the bank. A main source of income for Giuliani over the past two years has been a retirement account with a balance of just over $1 million in May, down from nearly $2.5 million in 2022 after his withdrawals, the filings say. In May, he spent nearly $33,000 including nearly $28,000 for condo and co-op costs for his Florida and New York City homes. He also spent about $850 on food, $390 on cleaning services, $230 on medicine, $200 on laundry and $190 on vehicles.",

        "title": "Ex-NBA player Jontay Porter pleads guilty in case tied to gambling scandal that tanked his career",
        "body_text": "NEW YORK -- Former NBA player Jontay Porter on Wednesday pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a federal criminal case tied to the betting scandal that got him banned from the league earlier this year. The former Toronto Raptors center entered the plea at his arraignment in a New York federal court and was set to be released on bond of $250,000. His lawyer had previously said that Porter was cooperating with authorities while being treated for a gambling addiction. Court papers showed the case against Porter is related to an ongoing prosecution of four other men. The four have been arraigned on a charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud but haven't yet entered any pleas. Those men are charged with scheming to profit off tips from an NBA player that he was going to exit two games early. They or their relatives used the knowledge to place big-winning bets that the athlete would do poorly in those games, according to a court complaint filed when they were charged in June. The complaint didn't name the player, but details matched up with an NBA investigation that spurred Porter's banishment from the league this spring. The league found that he gambled on NBA games and gave bettors confidential information about his health. In court Wednesday, Porter said he agreed to withdraw early from games to get out from under large gambling debts so he and co-conspirators could win bets on his performance. \"I know what I did was wrong, unlawful, and I am deeply sorry,\" he said. Porter is set to be sentenced Dec. 18. He could face from just under three and a half years in prison to a little over four years. He's also likely to be assessed hundreds of thousands of dollars in restitution, plus potential fines. According to the complaint, one of the four men pressed the player to clear up gambling debts by prematurely pulling out of games so that bets on him underperforming would pay off. In a message responding to the man's instructions, the player wrote that if he didn't carry out the plan, \"u hate me and if I don't get u 8k by Friday you're coming to Toronto to beat me up.\" After tipping off some of the men, the player claimed injury or illness and withdrew from Jan. 26 and March 20 games after only minutes on the court, the complaint said. Porter played only briefly on those dates before complaining he was hurt or sick and exiting the games. His points, rebounds and assists in both games fell below sportsbooks' expectations. After the NBA and others began investigating, the player messaged some of the men that they \"might just get hit w a rico,\" an apparent reference to the common acronym for a federal racketeering charge, according to the complaint against them. It said the player also asked the men whether they had deleted \"all the stuff\" from their phones. The NBA's probe found that Porter not only exited at least one game for gamblers' sake but also wagered on NBA games in which he didn't play. He once bet against his own team, the league said. Porter averaged 4.4 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 26 games this season, including five starts. He also played in 11 games for the Memphis Grizzlies in the 2020-21 season. The 24-year-old's NBA salary was about $410,000.

(AP) \u2014 Two astronauts who should have been back on Earth weeks ago said Wednesday that they\u2019re confident that Boeing\u2019s space capsule can return them safely, despite breakdowns. NASA test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched aboard Boeing\u2019s new Starliner capsule early last month, the first people to ride it. Helium leaks and thruster failures almost derailed their arrival at the International Space Station, and has kept them there much longer than planned. In their first news conference from orbit, they said they expect to return once thruster testing is complete here on Earth. They said they\u2019re not complaining about getting extra time in orbit, and are enjoying helping the station crew. \u201cI have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem,\u201d Williams told reporters. The test flight should have lasted eight days, ending on June 14. This week, NASA and Boeing are trying to duplicate the Starliner\u2019s thruster problems on a brand new unit at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, one of the prime landing sites in the U.S. western desert. The trouble is in the propulsion system, used to maneuver the spacecraft, Five thrusters failed as the capsule approached the space station on June 6, a day after liftoff. Four have since been reactivated. Wilmore said there should be enough working thrusters to get him and Williams out of orbit. There are also bigger engines that could fill in, if necessary. \u201cThat mantra you\u2019ve heard, failure is not an option, that\u2019s why we are staying here now,\u201d Wilmore said. \u201cWe trust that the tests that we\u2019re doing are the ones we need to do to get the right answers, to give us the data that we need to come back.\u201d Boeing and NASA consider the ground tests essential to determine what might have gone wrong since that part of the capsule \u2014 the service module \u2014 is discarded before landing. The leaks also are located in this disposable section. NASA ordered up the Starliner and SpaceX Dragon capsules a decade ago for astronaut flights to and from the space station, paying each company billions of dollars. SpaceX\u2019s first taxi flight with astronauts was in 2020. Boeing\u2019s first crew flight was repeatedly delayed because of software and other issues. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

        "body_text": "Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck\u2019s eldest child revealed that she contracted a post-viral condition in 2019 as she demanded mask mandates in LA hospitals during a city board meeting on Tuesday. Violet Affleck, 18, shared her experience with recovering from viruses in an emotional plea in front of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, saying \u201cthe county must oppose mask bans for any reason.\u201d During public comments, a section where residents have a chance to ask questions and advocate for a cause, Violet introduced herself before urging the board for the mandate. \u201cHi, Violet Affleck, Los Angeles resident, first-time voter, I\u2019m 18,\u201d she said in a clip of the meeting shared on X. \u201cI contracted a post-viral condition in 2019,\u201d she continued while donning a face mask. \u201cI\u2019m OK now, but I saw first-hand that medicine does not always have answers to the consequences of even minor viruses.\u201d \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has thrown that into sharper relief,\u201d she added. According to the Mayo Clinic, a post-viral condition \u2014 also known as \u201clong Covid\u201d \u2014 occurs following a viral infection. Symptoms can last for months and often include fatigue, lethargy, memory loss, inability to focus, and exhaustion. \u201cOne in 10 infections leads to long COVID, which is a devastating neurological and cardiovascular illness that can take away people\u2019s ability to work, see, move and even think,\u201d Violet said during the meeting. \u201c\u2018It stands to exacerbate our homelessness crisis, as well as the suffering of many people in our city. It hits communities of color, disabled people, elderly people, trans people, women and anyone in a public-facing essential job the hardest.\u201d In February, Los Angeles public health officials announced that employees and visitors to city healthcare facilities would no longer be required to wear masks. More than 37,000 people in Los Angeles died of COVID throughout the pandemic, trailing coronary heart disease and Alzheimer\u2019s deaths, according to officials. \u201cTo confront the long COVID crisis, I demand mask availability, air filtration and far-UVC lights in government facilities, including jails and detention centers, and mask mandates in county medical facilities,\u201d the teen added. \u201cWe must expand the availability of free tests and treatment and, most importantly, the county must oppose mask bans for any reason.\u201d \u201cThey do not keep us safer, they make vulnerable members of our community less safe and make everyone less able to participate in Los Angeles together. Thank you.\u201d Violet also wore a mask during Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin\u2019s Hamptons party last year, where she was snapped with her dad and stepmom Jennifer Lopez. The teen often opts to wear a face mask while out and about running errands. Affleck and Garner divorced in 2015 after 10 years of marriage and are also parents to Seraphina, 15, and Samuel, 12. Violet also boasts two step-siblings from her father\u2019s current marriage to Jennifer Lopez.

        "body_text": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 British police launched a huge manhunt Wednesday for a man believed to be armed with a crossbow and potentially other weapons after three women were killed in a house northwest of London. The BBC said the women killed were the family of well-known radio racing commentator John Hunt. Hertfordshire Police said Kyle Clifford, 26, was being sought over the suspected triple murder, which involved a crossbow and potentially other unnamed weapons. The public were urged not to approach Clifford if they see him. Armed police officers and specialist search teams were \u201cresponding at pace in the wake of what has been an horrific incident,\u201d Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said. Police said the three women \u2014 ages 25, 28 and 61 \u2014 were found seriously injured in a house in Bushey, northwest of London, on Tuesday evening. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene. BBC Radio 5 Live, the corporation\u2019s main news and sports radio channel, said the victims were Carol Hunt, wife of its commentator John Hunt, and two of their daughters. John Hunt is BBC radio\u2019s main horse racing commentator, his voice known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby. The Daily Mail newspaper and others reported that he found the bodies early Tuesday evening after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse south of London. As part of a note sent to BBC staff, the broadcaster described the incident as \u201cutterly devastating\u201d and that it will provide Hunt \u201cwith all the support we can.\u201d Police did not say whether Clifford, who is from London, was connected to the women, but British media reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters. The BBC reported that Clifford left the British Army after a brief period of service in 2022. Local councillor Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area is \u201ca typical leafy British suburb.\u201d \u201cAt about eight o\u2019clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\u201d he told the BBC. Addressing the suspect directly, Simpson said: \u201cKyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\u201d Britain\u2019s new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she is being kept \u201cfully informed\u201d about the \u201ctruly shocking\u201d incident. People in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse. A spokesperson for the Home Office said Cooper will \u201cswiftly consider\u201d the findings from a recently launched review into whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced. \u2014 By PAN PYLAS Associated Press",

        "body_text": "A court in Russia ordered the arrest of the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny during a hearing Tuesday that was conducted in absentia as part of a sweeping Kremlin crackdown on the opposition. Yulia Navalnaya, who lives abroad, would face arrest if and when she returns to Russia. Moscow\u2019s Basmanny District Court ruled to arrest Navalnaya on charges of alleged involvement in an extremist group. Navalny, the fiercest political foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin, died in February in an Arctic penal colony while serving a 19-year sentence on extremism charges that he had condemned as politically motivated. Authorities said he became ill after a walk but have otherwise given no details on Navalny\u2019s death. Navalny was imprisoned after returning to Moscow in January 2021 from Germany, where he had been recuperating from the 2020 nerve agent poisoning that he blamed on the Kremlin. Navalnaya has accused Putin of her husband\u2019s death and vowed to continue his activities. Russian officials have vehemently denied involvement in Navalny\u2019s poisoning and death. Navalnaya mocked the court\u2019s order on social media platform X, saying that it\u2019s Putin who should be be prosecuted. Her spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, described the court\u2019s ruling as a recognition of her \u201cmerits.\u201d German Chancellor Olaf Scholz noted on X that Navalnaya is carrying on her husband\u2019s legacy and denounced the Moscow court\u2019s ruling as \u201can arrest warrant against the desire for freedom and democracy.\u201d Russian authorities haven\u2019t specified the charges against Navalnaya. They appear to relate to authorities designating Navalny\u2019s Foundation for Fighting Corruption as an extremist organization. The 2021 court ruling that outlawed Navalny\u2019s group forced his close associates and team members to leave Russia. A number of journalists have been jailed on similar charges in recent months in relation to their coverage of Navalny.
