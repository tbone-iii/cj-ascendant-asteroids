                    "text": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) introduced legislation to impeach U.S. Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas. In bills filed on Wednesday, the Democratic lawmaker said the two justices should be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors related to refusals to recuse themselves in some instances and for failing to disclose gifts from conservative donors. One piece of legislation pointed out that Alito had allowed an upside-down American flag to be flown at his house following the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. \"By displaying this flag, he showed support for domestic enemies of the United States, some of whom engaged in an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol building, in violation of his Constitutional Oath of office,\" the bill said. The bill argued Alito should have recused himself in several cases involving former President Donald Trump and Jan. 6 defendants. \"Since a ‘stop the steal’ symbol first flew on a flagpole outside Justice Alito’s home, it has been reasonable to question Justice Alito’s ability to impartially adjudicate matters related to the January 6 insurrection,\" Ocasio-Cortez's legislation explained. Separate legislation presented by Ocasio-Cortez said Thomas should be impeached for failing to disclose gifts. \"Over the course of at least 15 years, Justice Thomas and his wife, Virginia 'Ginni' Thomas, have received gifts of significant value from Harlan Crow without reporting the source, description, and value of such gifts,\" the bill insisted. EXCLUSIVE:Trump’s ‘secretary of retribution’ has a ‘target list’ of 350 people he wants arrested \"By accepting but failing to disclose multiple gifts of luxury vacations and travel, Justice Thomas has undermined the impartiality and integrity of the Supreme Court in violation of the public trust,\" the legislation added. \"Wherefore, Justice Thomas, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial and removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.\" The bill also noted that Thomas had participated in \"numerous proceedings concerning challenges to the outcome of the 2020 Presidential election\" despite his wife's activism in support of former President Donald Trump's \"Stop the Steal\" movement. \"Justice Thomas’s impartiality in the aforementioned proceedings might reasonably be questioned because Mrs. Thomas actively participated in contemporaneous political and legal efforts to overturn Mr. Trump’s defeat in the 2020 Presidential election,\" the legislation said.",

                    "text": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., filed articles of impeachment against Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas on Wednesday, alleging \"unchecked corruption.\" Ocasio-Cortez threatened to file the articles last week, raising arguments about undisclosed gifts Thomas has received from wealthy conservatives and recent controversies involving Alito's home and personal politics. \"The unchecked corruption crisis on the Supreme Court has now spiraled into a Constitutional crisis threatening American democracy writ large,\" Cortez wrote in a statement. \"Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito’s pattern of refusal to recuse from consequential matters before the court in which they hold widely documented financial and personal entanglements constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law, the integrity of our democracy, and one of the clearest cases for which the tool of impeachment was designed.\" \"Justice Thomas and Alito’s repeated failure over decades to disclose that they received millions of dollars in gifts from individuals with business before the court is explicitly against the law. And their refusal to recuse from the specific matters and cases before the court in which their benefactors and spouses are implicated represents nothing less than a constitutional crisis. These failures alone would amount to a deep transgression worthy of standard removal in any lower court, and would disqualify any nominee to the highest court from confirmation in the first place,\" she argued. CONGRESSIONAL DEMS BLAST RULING ON TRUMP IMMUNITY: 'EXTREME RIGHT-WING SUPREME COURT' Ocasio-Cortez's Wednesday filing includes three articles of impeachment against Thomas and two against Alito. The charges against Thomas involve undisclosed gifts as well as his lack of recusal in cases allegedly involving his wife's legal and financial interests. NY DEM SLAMS 'SQUAD' MEMBER'S PROFANITY-LACED RANT AT RALLY WITH AOC: 'UNHINGED' The charges against Alito also include failure to disclose gifts and his lack of recusal in cases in which he had \"a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party\" before the court. Ocasio-Cortez first threatened an article of soft impeachment following the Supreme Court's ruling in former President Trump's immunity case. The ruling in question said a president has absolute immunity from prosecution for \"actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority,\" and \"presumptive immunity\" for official acts in general. The court said there is no immunity for unofficial acts. SCOTUS RULES EX-PRESIDENTS HAVE PROTECTION FROM PROSECUTION FOR OFFICIAL ACTS IN IMMUNITY CASE \"The Supreme Court has become consumed by a corruption crisis beyond its control,\" Ocasio-Cortez wrote on X following the decision. \"Today’s ruling represents an assault on American democracy. It is up to Congress to defend our nation from this authoritarian capture. I intend on filing articles of impeachment upon our return.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The lawmaker argues that Alito was biased in favor of Trump and participants in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. She and other critics base the accusation on Alito flying an \"appeal to heaven\" flag at his home. The flag has been a symbol associated with American independence since before the Revolutionary War.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and other Democrats filed articles of impeachment Wednesday against Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, as Democrats have railed against the conservative-leaning justices for alleged ethics violations—though the effort to oust the justices is sure to fail. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito attend a private ceremony for retired ... [+] Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on December 18, 2023 in Washington, DC. Getty Images Key Facts The articles of impeachment accuse the two justices of committing high crimes and misdemeanors by failing to disclose gifts and recuse themselves from cases, with the lawmakers filing three articles of impeachment against Thomas and two against Alito. The lawmakers alleged Thomas should be impeached because he failed to disclose numerous luxury vacations he received from real estate magnate Harlan Crow, as well as a real estate transaction with him, and because the justice didn’t recuse himself in cases in which his wife—a right-wing activist—had a financial or legal interest, including cases involving the 2020 election. Alito should be impeached because he didn’t recuse himself from cases in which he had a personal bias, the lawmakers alleged, pointing to the justice participating in cases involving the 2020 election and Jan. 6 riot despite reports he and his wife flew flags associated with the “Stop the Steal” movement outside their homes. The lawmakers also called for Alito’s impeachment because he accepted luxury travel without disclosing it, following reports that Alito traveled with billionaire Paul Singer, whose hedge fund had business before the court. The Supreme Court has not yet responded to a request for comment, but both Thomas and Alito have previously denied any wrongdoing or ethical misconduct, claiming their actions were above board and they were not required to disclose their travel. In addition to Ocasio-Cortez, the impeachment articles were co-sponsored by Reps. Barbara Lee, D-Calif.; Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.; Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J.; Delia Ramirez, D-Ill.; Maxwell Frost, D-Fla.; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; and Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y.

Crucial Quote The gifts that Alito and Thomas accepted without disclosing them mean “a reasonable person would believe that he used his public office for his own private gain or for the private gain of his donors,” the impeachment articles against both justices state. “In all of this, [Justices Alito and Thomas have] acted in a manner contrary to [their] trust as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.” What To Watch For The impeachment effort is all but certain to fail, as Republicans have heavily opposed Democrats’ ethics criticisms of the justices and attempts to investigate them or impose reforms. How Would A Justice Be Impeached? Impeachment of Supreme Court justices follows the same process as presidential impeachments: the House would first determine whether to impeach the official, and then the Senate would hold a trial to decide whether they should be removed from office. Justice Samuel Chase is the only Supreme Court justice who’s ever been impeached, but while the House voted to impeach him in 1805, he was then acquitted by the Senate. Chief Critics Thomas has previously said his gifts from Crow were merely hospitality from a close friend, and did start disclosing some travel on financial disclosures in 2022 and 2023, claiming he was now obligated to do so under new rules, but wasn’t before. (Senators have found several trips after the rule change that Thomas still failed to disclose.) His wife Ginni Thomas has denied her work has any impact on her husband, claiming the two do not discuss any cases. Crow has also denied any wrongdoing and said he and the justice do not discuss the court. Alito has strongly denied ethical wrongdoing, penning a Wall Street Journal op-ed before the ProPublica report came out about his relationship with Singer, claiming the outlet “misleads its readers.” He has also denied any involvement with the controversial flag-flying, saying it was his wife’s decision and he played no role in it. Key Background The articles of impeachment are part of a broader outrage over alleged ethics infractions by Supreme Court justices, particularly Thomas and Alito. Democrats have long called for Thomas to resign or be removed from office amid the controversies over his wife Ginni’s right-wing activism and the slew of gifts he’s received from wealthy friends, and the impeachment efforts come after two senators asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel to investigate the justice last week. Criticism against Alito reached a fever pitch in May as reports came out regarding he and his wife’s flag-flying, though the justice had also faced previous scrutiny over his travel with Singer and a New York Times report suggesting he may have leaked the court’s 2014 decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby. (Alito has denied sharing the decision.) Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have attempted to hold hearings on the ethics issues—with Chief Justice John Roberts rebuffing their request for him to testify—and pass legislation imposing a binding code of ethics on the court, like federal judges in lower courts already have to follow. Those efforts have failed as Republicans blocked the measures, and while the Supreme Court announced its own new code of ethics in November, ethics experts have criticized it for not going far enough, as it does not impose any consequences if the justices violate it.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) unveiled her impeachment articles against Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito on Wednesday, following through on a threat from the beginning of the month to do so after the high court’s presidential immunity ruling. Ocasio-Cortez said she introduced the articles as a response to the “unchecked corruption crisis on the Supreme Court” that has “spiraled into a Constitutional crisis.” “Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito’s pattern of refusal to recuse from consequential matters before the court in which they hold widely documented financial and personal entanglements constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law, the integrity of our democracy, and one of the clearest cases for which the tool of impeachment was designed,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a release. The first impeachment resolution regarding Thomas accuses him of failing to disclose gifts and income, refusing to recuse himself from matters related to his spouse’s legal interest in cases before the court, and refusing to recuse himself from matters related to his spouse’s financial interest in cases before the court. Alito faces accusations of refusing to recuse from cases before the court “in which he had a personal bias or prejudice against a party,” and failure to disclose gifts and income in his impeachment resolution. Alito refused to recuse himself from cases involving Trump and Jan. 6, 2021, defendants over an upside-down flag in 2021 and an “Appeal to Heaven” flag outside his New Jersey beach home, arguing that his wife had legal rights to fly the flag. Alito and Thomas have both denied wrongdoing in response to attacks that they have acted unethically, and Republicans have largely argued that critiques of Thomas and Alito are part of a Democratic smear campaign to delegitimize the court. Ocasio-Cortez has been vocal in her opposition to several recent Supreme Court rulings, as well as calling on the top court to address ethics concerns surrounding Alito and Thomas regarding undisclosed gifts and alleged political symbols and statements. After the Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that former President Donald Trump may have some immunity from prosecution related to actions he took in the aftermath of the 2020 election, Ocasio-Cortez said she intended to file impeachment articles upon lawmakers’ return to Capitol Hill after recess ended on Monday — but she did not specify which justices would face the articles. Co-sponsors of the impeachment articles against Alito and Thomas are Reps. Barbara Lee (D-CA), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ), Delia Ramirez (D-IL), Maxwell Frost (D-FL), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Jamaal Bowman (D-NY).

                    "text": "New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has introduced articles of impeachment against Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas. Ocasio-Cortez has long criticized multiple conservative members of the Supreme Court, but the rhetoric of impeachment was amped up in the wake of recent rulings, including the court's decision on presidential immunity. \"The unchecked corruption crisis on the Supreme Court has now spiraled into a Constitutional crisis threatening American democracy writ large,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement. \"Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito’s pattern of refusal to recuse from consequential matters before the court in which they hold widely documented financial and personal entanglements constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law, the integrity of our democracy, and one of the clearest cases for which the tool of impeachment was designed.\" Ocasio-Cortez specifically criticized gifts Thomas received from his friend, billionaire Harlan Crow. \"Clarence Thomas, in his conduct as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors, by refusing to report the source, description, and value of gifts, and by failing to report of real estate property,\" Ocasio-Cortez wrote in the articles, going on to list gifts he did not reportedly reveal. Thomas acknowledged in his latest annual financial report, released in June, that he had \"inadvertently omitted\" reimbursement for food and lodging expenses for the July 2019 travel. The articles against Thomas, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by George H.W. Bush in 1991, also cites Thomas' \"refusal to recuse from matters concerning his spouse’s legal interest in cases before the court\" and \"refusal to recuse from matters involving his spouse’s financial interest in cases before the court.\" As far as Alito, who was nominated by Bush in 2005, Ocasio-Cortez cites his \"refusal to recuse from cases in which he had a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party in cases before the court\" and \"failure to disclose financial income, gifts and reimbursements, property interests, liabilities, and transactions, among other information.\" Several other justices, including Neil Gorsuch, Sonia Sotomayor and John Roberts have also been criticized for monetary or personal ties to businesses and groups with cases before the court. Congress has the authority to remove a federal judge for \"'treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" through a vote of impeachment by the House of Representatives and a trial and conviction by the Senate, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Article III of the Constitution adds that judges \"shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour.\" A simple majority vote is required for the House to adopt the articles -- 218 votes -- for impeachment. Right now, Republicans hold 219 seats and Democrats hold 213. Only one Supreme Court justice has ever been impeached, according to the Federal Judicial Center. Associate Justice Samuel Chase was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives in 1804, \"on charges of arbitrary and oppressive conduct of trials,\" the center states. However, he was acquitted by the U.S. Senate in 1805 and remained on the bench.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has introduced articles of impeachment against conservative Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas over their failure to disclose gifts they have received while serving on the court – a messaging move that will surely fail in the GOP-controlled House. “Justice Thomas and Alito’s repeated failure over decades to disclose that they received millions of dollars in gifts from individuals with business before the court is explicitly against the law,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement. “And their refusal to recuse from the specific matters and cases before the court in which their benefactors and spouses are implicated represents nothing less than a constitutional crisis.” “Congress has a legal, moral, and democratic obligation to impeach,” she said. This is the latest example of House Democrats – led by some of their highest-profile members – prioritizing the Supreme Court in their campaign year messaging.

                    "text": "Washington — Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York introduced articles of impeachment against Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito on Wednesday, ramping up Democrats' disapproval of the high court in the wake of ethics issues and a spate of major decisions at the close of its latest term. It is all but certain that the resolutions will die in the Republican-controlled House, where GOP lawmakers have accused Democrats of mounting a campaign to undermine the court's legitimacy in response to rulings on abortion, guns and presidential power they dislike. Still, the move by Ocasio-Cortez escalates Democrats' scrutiny of the high court's conservative justices, who hold six of the nine seats. The Supreme Court did not immediately return a request for comment.The resolution filed against Thomas claims he engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors by failing to report travel accommodations and tuition for his grandnephew provided by Republican megadonor Harlan Crow, as well as free rent and home improvements related to a 2014 real estate transaction between the justice and Crow.The measure, which contains three articles of impeachment, accuses Thomas of undermining the \"impartiality and integrity\" of the high court by failing to include the trips on his annual financial disclosure reports. Ocasio-Cortez's resolution also seeks to punish Thomas for refusing to recuse himself from cases involving the 2020 presidential election because of the activities of his wife, Ginni Thomas. Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist, corresponded with former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about efforts to overturn the election results. She testified in 2022 that she did not discuss the legal challenges involving the election with her husband.Still, the impeachment resolution claims that Thomas \"betrayed his judicial oath\" by violating federal ethics law.\"Given the court's demonstrated inability to preserve its own legitimate conduct, it is incumbent upon Congress to contain the threat this poses to our democracy and the hundreds of millions of Americans harmed by the crisis of corruption unfurling within the court. Congress has a legal, moral, and democratic obligation to impeach,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement.Thomas and Crow have been friends for more than two decades, and the justice didn't believe he was required to report the trips with Crow under rules regarding personal hospitality, he said last year. Thomas pledged to comply with new disclosure guidelines from the Judicial Conference issued last March, and he included travel on Crow's private jet, as well as lodging at an Adirondacks property, on his 2022 disclosure. That report also listed the 2014 real estate transaction. Thomas also reported two trips he took with Crow in 2019 to Bali, Indonesia, and Monte Rio, California, on his latest disclosure form filed in May. Democrats, though, have accused the conservative justice of omitting other gifts and income from federal forms.The impeachment resolution targeting Alito, which contains two articles, stems in part from flags that were displayed outside his Virginia residence and New Jersey vacation home in recent years. The first, an upside-down American flag, was flown outside Alito's Virginia house in January 2021, and the second, an \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag, was displayed outside his New Jersey residence in the summer of 2023.Both types of flags were carried by rioters who breached the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, but Alito has said he was not involved in the displays outside his homes. Instead, the justice told congressional Democrats in May that his wife flew the two flags, and neither of them knew of the meanings that have been ascribed to them in recent years.But Ocasio-Cortez's resolution claims that the flying of the flags showed a \"lack of impartiality\" by Alito and required his recusal from cases before the Supreme Court involving former President Donald Trump and the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol.Alito had rebuffed calls to step aside from those cases, telling Democrats that a \"reasonable person who is not motivated by political or ideological considerations or a desire to affect the outcome of Supreme Court cases would conclude that this event does not meet the applicable standard for recusal.\"The impeachment resolution also accuses Alito of failing to disclose trips funded by unnamed individuals with interests before the Supreme Court and declining to step aside from hearing cases affecting a benefactor's business interests.Ocasio-Cortez's resolution does not name the individuals, but a June 2023 ProPublica report revealed Alito flew aboard a private jet for a vacation at a luxury fishing lodge in Alaska in July 2008. The jet was provided by billionaire Paul Singer, whose hedge fund and related entities had sought the Supreme Court's intervention in past disputes. Thomas' travel with Crow ramped up pressure on the Supreme Court by Congress to unilaterally enact a code of conduct, which it did in November. The Senate Judiciary Committee has been investigating the ethics practices at the nation's highest court and is expected to release a report with its findings this summer.In addition to the ethics concerns, Democrats have also denounced a number of high-profile rulings by its conservative majority. The Supreme Court last week found that a former president is entitled to immunity from federal prosecution for official acts, a decision with significant ramifications for the criminal charges against Trump. He has pleaded not guilty.The high court also invalidated a federal ban on bump stocks and reversed a 40-year-old decision that gave federal agencies broad regulatory power, curtailing their authority.",

                    "text": "Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez filed articles of impeachment on Wednesday against Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. While the articles are unlikely to pass muster in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, the move is a rebuke to the two conservative justices, who have recently been accused of improper relationships with wealthy Republican donors. “Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito’s pattern of refusal to recuse from consequential matters before the court in which they hold widely documented financial and personal entanglements constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law, the integrity of our democracy, and one of the clearest cases for which the tool of impeachment was designed,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote in a statement announcing the articles of impeachment. “Justice Thomas and Alito’s repeated failure over decades to disclose that they received millions of dollars in gifts from individuals with business before the court is explicitly against the law. And their refusal to recuse from the specific matters and cases before the court in which their benefactors and spouses are implicated represents nothing less than a constitutional crisis,” she added. The articles accuse both Thomas and Alito of failing to disclose “income, gifts and reimbursements, property interests, liabilities, and transactions, among other information.” ProPublica has reported on Thomas’ relationship with billionaire Harlan Crow, who lavished the justice with rides on private jets and luxury yachts, expensive vacations, tuition payments, and even the purchase of properties. Alito similarly accepted trips and other luxury boons from billionaire Paul Singer, and later adjudicated a case involving Singer that came before the court. Both justices are also accused of “fefusal to recuse from cases in which he had a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party in cases before the court.” Thomas and Alito have both been accused of violating ethics norms by ruling on cases involving the events of January 6 when questions have been raised about their views on the Capitol riot. Two flags associated with sympathy for the “Stop the Steal” movement flew outside of Alito’s residences — though he blamed his wife for their presence. Thomas’ wife, Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, was involved in post-election efforts to pressure former Vice President Mike Pence into interfering with the certification of the Electoral College. Ginni Thomas was also on the payroll of conservative dark money groups who brought several matters before the court. This landed Thomas a third article of impeachment “refusal to recuse from matters involving his spouse’s financial interest in cases before the court.” With no existing, binding code of ethics to hold Supreme Court justices to account for their off-the-bench dealings, Democrats have pushed legislation that would “require Supreme Court justices to adopt a code of conduct, create a mechanism to investigate alleged violations of the code of conduct and other laws, improve disclosure and transparency when a justice has a connection to a party or amicus before the Court, and require justices to explain their recusal decisions to the public.” But with a split Congress and little advancement down the legislative path, Ocasio-Cortez wrote that “it is incumbent upon Congress to contain the threat this poses to our democracy and the hundreds of millions of Americans harmed by the crisis of corruption unfurling within the court. Congress has a legal, moral, and democratic obligation to impeach.”",

                    "text": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and a group of fellow House progressives introduced articles of impeachment against Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, accusing the two conservative Supreme Court justices of refusing to recuse themselves from cases in which they had a \"personal bias or prejudice concerning a party\" and failing to accurately disclose income and gifts from Republican megadonors. The articles additionally charge Thomas with not recusing himself from \"matters involving his spouse's financial interest in cases before the court.\" Their alleged improprieties have created an \"unchecked corruption crisis on the Supreme Court\" that \"constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law, the integrity of our democracy, and one of the clearest cases for which the tool of impeachment was designed,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement. She was joined by co-sponsors Reps. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., Rashida Tlaib D-Mich., Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y. Thomas and Alito have been the subject of a flood of reports from investigative news outlet ProPublica that have revealed their financial ties to donors who have had business before the court, which they failed to disclose. Alito has also landed in trouble for pro-insurrection flags that have been flown in front of his homes in Virginia and New Jersey, calling into question his impartiality in cases related to the Jan. 6 insurrection. Amid public outcry over their paid luxury vacations and other controversies, the Supreme Court adopted a code of conduct that, while being the first of its kind in the court's history, lacks an enforcement mechanism. Efforts by Senate Democrats to open the door to investigate judicial misconduct were blocked by Republicans, who called the effort \"constitutional overreach.\" The justices have largely dismissed and denied the reports about them, with Alito complaining that ProPublica ran a hit piece because they didn't like his rulings. Thomas' personal attorney claimed said last year that his client “has always strived for full transparency and adherence to the law.”",

                    "text": "Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez introduced articles of impeachment against the conservative US supreme court justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito on Wednesday over the justices’ “pattern of refusal to recuse from consequential matters before the court”. The articles of impeachment are unlikely to gain traction in the US House, which is controlled by Republicans. The effort follows calls from two US senators, Sheldon Whitehouse and Ron Wyden, for the US attorney general to appoint a special counsel to investigate potential criminal violations of federal ethics and tax laws by Thomas. “Justice Thomas and Alito’s repeated failure over decades to disclose that they received millions of dollars in gifts from individuals with business before the court is explicitly against the law. And their refusal to recuse from the specific matters and cases before the court in which their benefactors and spouses are implicated represents nothing less than a constitutional crisis,” Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York, said in a statement. The articles were supported by seven other Democrats in the House. Ocasio-Cortez continued: “The unchecked corruption crisis on the supreme court has now spiraled into a constitutional crisis threatening American democracy writ large.” Reporting by the news outlet ProPublica revealed that Thomas failed to disclose several luxury vacation trips that were paid for by Harlan Crow, a conservative megadonor. Thomas has also been pressed to recuse himself from cases involving the January 6 US Capitol attack and Donald Trump because his wife, Ginni, is involved with groups that were connected to the insurrection. The resolution filed against Thomas contains three articles of impeachment. The first focuses on his failure to disclose gifts from Crow. The second two involve his refusal to recuse himself from cases connected to his wife. Alito also took a vacation with and flew on a private jet chartered by Peter Singer, a Republican billionaire. Additionally, Alito refused to recuse himself from cases involving the attack on the US Capitol after it was reported that his wife, Martha-Ann, flew an upside-down American flag associated with the insurrection at their Virginia home. Further, the Alitos flew a flag associated with Christian nationalism at a beach home in New Jersey. Ocasio-Cortez filed two articles of impeachment against Alito. One focuses on his failure to disclose luxury travel and the other on his refusal to recuse himself from January 6 cases. Alito and Thomas were both part of a majority opinion earlier this month saying that former presidents have immunity from prosecution for official acts, a major win for Trump. They both also were in the majority in a case narrowing the grounds under which January 6 participants can be criminally prosecuted. Supreme court justices have wide discretion over whether to recuse themselves from a given case – something that sets them apart from other justices. Facing pressure after ProPublica’s reporting, the court’s nine justices formalized a code of conduct last November, a move that was seen as a step in the right direction, but still weak.",

                    "text": "On Wednesday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) filed articles of impeachment against Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, in the boldest move yet to resolve the Court’s “unchecked corruption crisis” as it radically reshapes the U.S. government in the image of the conservative justices’ right-wing allies. Ocasio-Cortez said that the two justices’ transgressions represent “one of the clearest cases for which the tool of impeachment was designed” and must be reined in for the sake of U.S. democracy. “Justice Thomas and Alito’s repeated failure over decades to disclose that they received millions of dollars in gifts from individuals with business before the court is explicitly against the law. And their refusal to recuse from the specific matters and cases before the court in which their benefactors and spouses are implicated represents nothing less than a constitutional crisis,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement. “These failures alone would amount to a deep transgression worthy of standard removal in any lower court, and would disqualify any nominee to the highest court from confirmation in the first place,” she continued. “Congress has a legal, moral, and democratic obligation to impeach.” The lawmaker filed three articles against Thomas and two against Alito, levying charges against both of refusing to recuse from cases that represented conflicts of interest for the justices as well as failing to disclose gifts they have received from special interest donors over their decades on the bench. Ocsaio-Cortez’s impeachment articles are cosponsored by eight House members, including Representatives Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan), Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) and Jamaal Bowman (D-New York). They are also endorsed by several court watchdog and progressive groups. Recent reports have revealed that Thomas and Alito have received millions of dollars’ worth of gifts while on the bench that they either failed to disclose or, many argue, should never have accepted to begin with in accordance with ethics standards. The extent of the justices’ largesse from conservative donors grows each time it’s scrutinized, especially in the case of Thomas, who has received more gifts than every other justice combined in his time on the bench. In combination with the Supreme Court’s string of far right rulings in recent years — and ties that justices have maintained to groups supporting arguments in the Court — the revelations have made clear a deep level of corruption at the nation’s top court at a time when it seeks to concentrate more and more power in itself. The Republican-dominated House is unlikely to vote to impeach the justices. However, the filing is a show of the urgency of the legitimacy crisis that the Supreme Court is facing as the justices apparently seek to legislate from the bench. Democrats in the Senate are also seeking accountability for Thomas. On Tuesday, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Federal Courts Chair Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island) and Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) sent a letter urging the Department of Justice to open a criminal investigation into Thomas and his benefactors for potential ethics breaches, false statements and tax fraud. The lawmakers laid out a mountain of evidence of Thomas’s misdoings, saying that the fact that Thomas has received so many gifts over such a long period of time — and the fact that lawmakers and reporters are seemingly constantly uncovering new undisclosed gifts — could warrant the appointment of a special counsel to conduct the probe. “The evidence assembled thus far plainly suggests that Justice Thomas has committed numerous willful violations of federal ethics and false-statement laws and raises significant questions about whether he and his wealthy benefactors have complied with their federal tax obligations,” the lawmakers wrote. “Presented with opportunities to resolve questions about his conduct, Justice Thomas has maintained a suspicious silence.”",

                    "text": "July 10 (UPI) -- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., filed articles of impeachment Wednesday against Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito for creating what she called an \"unchecked corruption crisis on the Supreme Court.\" Ocasio-Cortez accused Thomas and Alito of failing to recuse themselves from cases \"in which they hold widely documented financial and personal entanglements,\" which she said \"constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law.\" \"Justice Thomas and Alito's repeated failure over decades to disclose that they received millions of dollars in gifts from individuals with business before the court is explicitly against the law,\" Ocasio-Cortez said Wednesday in a statement. \"And their refusal to recuse from specific matters and cases before the court in which their benefactors and spouses are implicated represents nothing less than a constitutional crisis.\" Justices Thomas and Alito have not responded to Wednesday's impeachment articles, which include a \"failure to disclose financial income, gifts and reimbursements, property interests, liabilities and transactions.\" Last month, a Senate Judiciary Committee report revealed Thomas did not immediately disclose three trips, paid for by Republican mega-donor Harlan Crow, which included private jet travel and an eight-day yacht excursion. Last year, a report by ProPublica accused Alito of taking a luxury fishing trip, more than 15 years ago, with a billionaire Republican donor. Thomas faces two additional impeachment articles related to his \"refusal to recuse from matters concerning his spouse's legal interest in cases before the court,\" as well as her \"financial interest in cases before the court.\" A second impeachment article against Alito refers to a \"refusal to recuse from cases in which he had a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party in cases before the court.\" Alito and Thomas have faced calls to recuse themselves from cases related to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol and from last week's presidential immunity decision. Thomas's wife was reportedly involved in the \"Stop the Steal\" movement, as Alito has come under fire for an upside-down flag at his home connected to the same movement. Alito said his wife was responsible for the flag, as both justices refused calls to recuse. Following the high court's decision last week to grant partial immunity to former President Donald Trump, Ocasio-Cortez vowed to file impeachment articles against at least one Supreme Court justice. The New York Congresswoman also introduced the High Court Gift Ban Act last week that would prohibit Supreme Court justices from receiving gifts valued at more than $50. Last year, Ocasio-Cortez called for the impeachment of Justice Thomas following reports he accepted gifts and luxury travel, but did not follow through because the articles were unlikely to advance in the Republican-controlled house. Reps. Barbara Lee, D-Calif; Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.; Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J.; Delia Ramirez, D-Ill.; Maxwell Frost, D-Fla.; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y.; and Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, joined Ocasio-Cortez on Wednesday to co-sponsored the impeachment articles against Justices Thomas and Alito.",

                    "text": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is moving forward with her attempt to impeach two members of the Supreme Court: Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas. On Wednesday, July 10, the New York congresswoman, 34, formally presented her argument for moving to oust both Justice Alito, 74, and Justice Thomas, 76, introducing articles of impeachment against both. In a press release announcing the resolutions, Ocasio-Cortez claimed that the “unchecked corruption crisis on the Supreme Court has now spiraled into a Constitutional crisis threatening American democracy writ large.” “The Constitution of the United States explicitly outlines a higher standard of conduct for the judiciary to meet, far surpassing its existing bars on treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors for all civil officers: the standard of Good Behavior,” Ocasio-Cortez said in her statement. She asserted that the far-right justices have instead exhibited a “pattern of refusal to recuse from consequential matters before the court in which they hold widely documented financial and personal entanglements,” adding that it poses a \"grave threat\" to the justice system's integrity. The congresswoman also claimed that — aside from remaining on cases with conflicts of interest — the justices' failure to “disclose that they received millions of dollars in gifts from individuals” over the decades is “explicitly against the law.” Both Thomas and Alito’s impeachment articles include a charge of \"failure to disclose financial income, gifts and reimbursements, property interests, liabilities, and transactions, among other information.\" Additionally, Thomas’ resolution includes charges of “refusal to recuse from matters concerning his spouse’s legal interest in cases before the court” and “refusal to recuse from matters involving his spouse’s financial interest in cases before the court.” Alito’s, meanwhile, includes an additional charge of “refusal to recuse from cases in which he had a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party in cases before the court.” “Given the court’s demonstrated inability to preserve its own legitimate conduct, it is incumbent upon Congress to contain the threat this poses to our democracy and the hundreds of millions of Americans harmed by the crisis of corruption unfurling within the court,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Congress has a legal, moral, and democratic obligation to impeach.” Thomas and Alito, the two oldest and most conservative members of the Supreme Court, were appointed to their roles in 1991 and 2005, respectively. Each have fallen into controversy in recent years over their financial ties to wealthy GOP donors and their families' alleged acts of partisanship.

                    "text": "USA Basketball has a roster spot open on its men’s Olympic team. According to Shams Charania and Joe Vardon of The Athletic, Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard withdrew from the team during its training camp in Las Vegas, which opened up an opportunity for someone else to join the roster before they head over to France — Charania and Vardon noted that Derrick White is a strong candidate to join the team. The news was confirmed not long after by USA Basketball, which released a statement indicating that Leonard “had a few strong practices,” but ultimately, the decision was made for him “to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.” It is unclear if anything happened to Leonard — who famously has a checkered injury history — which led to him leaving the team. This comes right before the team’s first exhibition game in the lead-up to the Olympics, which will take place on Wednesday night against Canada. Losing Leonard is a huge blow for USA Basketball, because while he would almost certainly come off the bench and play limited minutes, his ability to stretch the floor and provide elite on-ball defense would have been an excellent fit on the wing. The roster’s other listed forwards are Kevin Durant, LeBron James, and Jayson Tatum, and while those are three elite players who thrive in the international game, Leonard would have provided something a little different.",

                    "text": "Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard is withdrawing from Team USA and will not play in the 2024 Olympic Games, USA Basketball announced on Wednesday. The official statement from USAB: \"Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas. He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\" Leonard's 2023-24 NBA season ended around a right knee injury. He did not play in the regular season after March 31 for the Clippers and then appeared in just two of their six playoff games. Derrick White of the Boston Celtics is a \"strong candidate\" to replace Leonard on the roster, according to The Athletic. Team USA's first exhibition game is Wednesday at 10:30 p.m. ET against Canada at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. At practice on Tuesday, Leonard told reporters, \"Yeah, I think I'll suit up tomorrow,\" per ESPN. \"Everything's been good so far. [The knee has] been at a neutral state, and I hope it stays that way.\" Clippers coach Tyronn Lue told ESPN on Tuesday, \"He's been good, the best I've seen him move since he got injured. Moving really good. It's good to see him healthy and trending in the right direction.\"",

                    "text": "USA Basketball announced Wednesday that Los Angeles Clippers forward Kawhi Leonard has withdrawn from the 2024 Olympic team. In a statement, USA Basketball noted that while Leonard \"felt ready to compete\" and had some good practices with the team despite missing the Clippers' final four playoff games last season with a knee injury, USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it was \"in his best interest\" to withdraw. According to Andscape's Marc J. Spears, Boston Celtics guard Derrick White will take Leonard's place on the roster. Spears also reported that Leonard's camp reached out to USA Basketball two days ago \"expressing concern,\" which may have played a role in the decision. While the nature of the concern was not specified, it may have something to do with his robust injury history. The 33-year-old Leonard played in 68 regular-season games in 2023-24, marking the first time he reached the 60-game mark since the 2018-19 campaign, which was his only year with the Toronto Raptors. Leonard missed the entire 2021-22 season due to a torn ACL and returned to appear in 52 contests the following season. This past season, Leonard reclaimed his spot as one of the NBA's top players, averaging 23.7 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 2.1 three-pointers made and 1.6 steals per game en route to his sixth career All-Star selection. However, the two-time NBA Finals MVP and two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year missed four of the Clips' six first-round playoff games against the eventual Western Conference champion Dallas Mavericks due to knee inflammation. Anything knee-related is a concern when it comes to Leonard since he has missed a significant amount of time during his career with knee issues. Leonard signed a three-year, $149.51 million contract extension with the Clippers in January, and given that Paul George left L.A. for the Philadelphia 76ers in free agency, the Clips can ill afford to have Kawhi risk further injury. The Clippers' head coach, Ty Lue, is an assistant coach for Team USA, meaning he had a firsthand look at Leonard during Team USA's practices and scrimmages this week. If USA Basketball chooses White as the replacement for Leonard, it will be adding another 2024 NBA champion to the roster alongside his Celtics teammates in Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday. The 30-year-old White is coming off the best season of his career, as he averaged 15.2 points, 5.2 assists, 4.2 rebounds, 2.7 three-pointers made and 1.0 steal per game while shooting 46.1 percent from the field and 39.6 percent from beyond the arc. White has been named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team in each of the past two seasons, so he would give Team USA another elite perimeter defender. Despite losing a player of Leonard's stature, the Americans remain heavy favorites to win a fifth straight Olympic gold medal in men's basketball due to the presence of superstars such as LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Joel Embiid, Tatum and a host of others. Team USA's first group game at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris is scheduled for July 28 against Serbia, followed by clashes with South Sudan and Puerto Rico on July 31 and Aug. 3, respectively.",

                    "text": "Los Angeles Clippers star forward Kawhi Leonard is withdrawing himself from the Team USA roster ahead of the Olympics, according to Shams. It was determined by Leonard and the Clippers that he needed to rest and prepare for the upcoming season, which meant that Leonard would have to drop out from the Olympic team. Leonard missed the last three playoff games of the Clippers’ season due to nagging knee inflammation, a damper on a season that saw the star forward play the most regular season games for the Clippers in a long time. With that in mind, the Clippers want to have him 100% by the time the season comes around, which meant Leonard leaves Team USA. This now opens up a roster spot, one where many guys have a shot at donning the red, white and blue. According to Andscape’s Mark Spears, Derrick White has been chosen to replace Leonard on Team USA after playing a critical role in the Celtics’ championship run. Leonard’s loss will hurt on the perimeter, but White is a great defender and will help in that area without needing the ball too much. Team USA takes on Canada in a basketball showcase tonight at 9:30 pm EST on FS1.",

He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it’s in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris,” USA Basketball said in a statement. In his place, Marc J. Spears of Andscape reports that Celtics point guard Derrick White will be replacing Leonard on the roster. White was seemingly chosen over Knicks guard Jalen Brunson, who made second-team All-NBA this past season as one of the league’s top players. Leonard sustained a right knee injury at the end of the season for the Clippers, which promptly ended their playoff run before it began. The Clippers star had previously noted that his knee was not 100 percent but was hopeful to be able to suit up for the Olympics. “Yeah. But I took the time, and I was able to turn around over the last two weeks,” Leonard told ESPN on Sunday. “So, I’m out here now and, yeah, I’m having a good time.” That appears to have flipped as of Wednesday with the latest announcement as the squad prioritizes perimeter defense. The 2024 Olympics begin on July 26 and run through Aug. 11.",

                    "text": "By TIM REYNOLDS LAS VEGAS (AP) — Kawhi Leonard will not be part of the U.S. men’s basketball team that will compete in the Paris Games after all. It would have been the first Olympic trip for Leonard, who missed 12 of the Los Angeles Clippers’ final 14 games this past season with right knee inflammation. USA Basketball said it, along with the Clippers, made the decision on Leonard’s status. “Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas,” USA Basketball said in a statement Wednesday. “He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it’s in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.” USA Basketball will be permitted to replace Leonard on the 12-man roster and was working toward bringing in Boston Celtics guard Derrick White to take his place, a person with knowledge of the discussions told The Associated Press. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because USA Basketball did not reveal that publicly, and it wasn’t immediately clear when the addition would be finalized. Leonard is a two-time NBA champion, six-time All-Star and six-time All-NBA player, but injury issues have been a recurring theme in his career. He has missed 256 regular-season games over the last seven years, including all of the 2021-22 season with knee trouble. He appeared in 68 games this past season for the Clippers, his most since playing in 74 for San Antonio during the 2016-17 season. “This is just my journey,” Leonard said earlier this week, discussing his injuries. “I can’t lay out the perfect script for me. Last year I tried to play as much as possible, felt great and at a certain period of time I couldn’t go. I tried the best that I could, but it’s just my journey. I don’t want to be in a situation that (I’m) in, but I’ve got to take it for what it is. And a lot of people are watching, supporters or doubters. But I motivate a lot of people, so I’ve got to keep doing what I’m doing.” Leonard — part of a 592-person Olympic team formally named by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee earlier Wednesday — had said earlier this week that his knee was fine and he was able to resume on-court training about three weeks ago to get ready for the Games. “I’m ready to go,” Leonard said then. “I’m playing now so, I’m happy.” That leaves the U.S., at least for the very short term, with 10 available players. Kevin Durant will not play against Canada because of a calf strain and could not compete in the team’s four-day training camp in Las Vegas that ended Tuesday. Leonard had been invited to be part of USA Basketball teams in the past and had to decline for various reasons, primarily injury issues or long playoff runs. “I always wanted to play against other talent overseas or just other basketball styles and players,” Leonard said. “It is one of the reasons why I play the game.”",

USA Basketball said it, along with the Clippers, made the decision on Leonard’s status. “Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas,” USA Basketball said in a statement Wednesday. “He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it’s in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.” Leonard is a two-time NBA champion, six-time All-Star and six-time All-NBA player, but injury issues have been a recurring theme in his career. He has missed 256 regular-season games over the last seven years, including all of the 2021-22 season with knee trouble. He appeared in 68 games this past season for the Clippers, his most since playing in 74 for San Antonio during the 2016-17 season. “This is just my journey,” Leonard said earlier this week, discussing his injuries. “I can’t lay out the perfect script for me. Last year I tried to play as much as possible, felt great and at a certain period of time I couldn’t go. I tried the best that I could, but it’s just my journey. I don’t want to be in a situation that (I’m) in, but I’ve got to take it for what it is. And a lot of people are watching, supporters or doubters. But I motivate a lot of people, so I’ve got to keep doing what I’m doing.” Leonard — part of a 592-person Olympic team formally named by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee earlier Wednesday — had said earlier this week that his knee was fine and he was able to resume on-court training about three weeks ago to get ready for the Games. “I’m ready to go,” Leonard said then. “I’m playing now so, I’m happy.” A couple of days later, hours before the first U.S. exhibition game against Canada and one day before the team departs for Abu Dhabi — the first of two international stops for more games and practices before arriving in France for the Olympics — Leonard was gone. That leaves the U.S., at least for the very short term, with 10 available players. Kevin Durant will not play against Canada because of a calf strain and could not compete in the team’s four-day training camp in Las Vegas that ended Tuesday. Leonard had been invited to be part of USA Basketball teams in the past and had to decline for various reasons, primarily injury issues or long playoff runs. “I always wanted to play against other talent overseas or just other basketball styles and players,” Leonard said. “It is one of the reasons why I play the game.” ___ AP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games",

                    "text": "When USA Basketball announced their 12-man roster for the Olympics earlier this summer, there were a couple significant question marks on the roster due to injury concerns. Joel Embiid had knee troubles off and on all season and would be coming off of a playoff run, while Kawhi Leonard was unable to play for the Clippers in the playoffs and would have just a couple months to get ready for an extended summer run with Team USA. While Embiid seems to be ready to go for Paris, the unfortunately unsurprising news broke on Wednesday that Leonard was withdrawing from the team due to continued inflammation in his knee. In his place, USA Basketball turned to the champion Boston Celtics to add a third member from that title team to the roster, but instead of Finals MVP Jaylen Brown, they opted to bolster their point guard rotation with Derrick White. That wasn’t a shocker for many plugged into Team USA, but it was a bit of a surprise to those on the outside, including Brown himself who posted a bit of a cryptic and curious reaction on Twitter. Last year, Brown spoke about what playing for Team USA on the Olympic squad would mean to him, saying there’s “no greater honor” than playing for USA Basketball at the Olympics. Team USA certainly needed to bolster its defense, but Brown also played pretty tremendously on that end in the Finals — his work on Luka Doncic was largely a reason he earned Finals MVP. The biggest thing might’ve been that White wouldn’t be too worried about his minutes load, although it’s possible he gets plenty of run, especially if Team USA decides they need more defense than someone like, say, Tyrese Haliburton can provide at the point of attack. In any case, Brown is understandably not happy with the snub and that it’s his teammate that got the call makes the news all the more bittersweet.",

                    "text": "BOSTON (WHDH) - The Celtics will have another player going for gold at the Paris Olympics this summer after USA Basketball tabbed Derrick White to replace Kawhi Leonard Men’s National Team Wednesday. White will join Boston teammates Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday on the Team USA. In joining the team, White will also make his return to international competition after last playing on the 2019 USA Men’s National Team that finished in seventh place in that year’s FIBA Basketball World Cup. USA Basketball announced Leonard’s departure from its roster in a statement late Wednesday morning. Officials said Leonard had been “ramping up for the Olympics and had a few strong practices.” “He felt ready to compete,” USA Basketball said. “However, he respects that USA Basketball and the [LA] Clippers determined it’s in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.” Just over an hour after the initial announcement, USA Basketball shared a new post on X welcoming White to the team. White came to Boston via a trade in 2022. He averaged 15.2 points per game in the 2023-2024 regular season, with 4.2 rebounds, 5.2 assists, and 1.2 blocks. White then notched a career-best playoff performance as his team marched to its 18th championship, racking up 16.7 points per game, 4.3 rebounds, 4.1 assists, and 1.2 blocks in the 2024 postseason. The opening ceremonies for the 2024 Summer Olympics are scheduled for July 26. The US Men’s Basketball Team will play its first game on July 28 when it faces Serbia.

(Photo by Jacob Kupferman/Getty Images) Getty Images Kawhi Leonard’s Olympic run was short-lived. Team USA announced Wednesday that Leonard is withdrawing from team activities ahead of the 2024 Olympics. According to an official release, it was a joint decision made by USA Basketball and the LA Clippers to hold Leonard out of this summer’s competition. Despite Leonard feeling comfortable enough to play after rehabbing his injured right knee, he respected their decision to preserve his health. With the unfortunate luck Leonard has endured over the last three years, it’s only logical for all parties to take a cautious approach. The last thing a player — or their incumbent team — wants is to jeopardize a full season by risking an untimely injury or reaggravation of the knee. For the Clippers, who can likely sense their championship window closing, they simply have to maximize every opportunity. Grant Hill, managing director of the USA Men’s national team, issued a personal statement on Leonard withdrawing from competition. “I want to thank Kawhi for his commitment to the USA Men’s National Team,” Hill said. “He earned the opportunity to represent the United States, but USA Basketball and Clippers leadership felt it’s important to allow Kawhi to prepare for the NBA season.” MORE FOR YOU Northern Lights Alert: Beware ‘Head-On’ Aurora Displays, Scientists Say NYT ‘Strands’ Hints, Spangram And Answers For Wednesday, July 10th Microsoft Windows Deadline—You Have 21 Days To Update Your PC Leonard was participating in most of the contact drills and scrimmages, and he was expected to be available for Team USA’s first exhibition game on Wednesday against Canada. It didn’t take long to fill his spot. Boston Celtics guard Derrick White was immediately announced as Leonard’s replacement. White, fresh off the best season of his career and a championship run, will become one of USA’s utility guys off the bench. The selection shouldn’t be a surprise. White was rumored to be the choice weeks ago when Leonard was forced to miss the final three games of the Clippers’ first round series against Dallas.

NOTE TO USER: User expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and or using this photograph, User is consenting to the terms and conditions of the Getty Images License Agreement. (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images) Getty Images Nevertheless, most of the reaction on social media was negative, with fans wondering why the replacement wasn’t another All-NBA level star or high-profile scorer. But the reality is, White fills an important role the coaching staff is looking for. Team USA is already stacked with elite scoring talent and players that can easily generate their own shot. They are loaded with pick-and-roll creators, dynamic finishers around the basket, and veterans that are overqualified to be second-side scorers when the defense collapses on the first action. Plus, let’s face it — USA is already heavily favored to win the gold medal. Even if Leonard didn’t have a replacement, their talent advantage over the field would still be severe and undeniable. There’s nothing wrong with welcoming an intelligent, feisty defender that hustles on every possession while also being a 40-plus percent knockdown shooter on spot-ups. White is also a low-maintenance wing that is never concerned about his shot volume or the number of touches he receives — which is also right up Steve Kerr’s alley. He’ll be a fantastic plug-and-play option in virtually any lineup USA wants to experiment with. And if his playing time is cut short or non-existent, he’s not the type to complain. As for Leonard, the Clippers’ franchise star now has 11 weeks to rest and completely heal before NBA training camps begin. Assuming he doesn’t need surgery this summer, Leonard could certainly use the extra time off to recover for the 2024-25 regular season. He and the Clippers understand they have virtually no margin for error after Paul George’s departure in free agency. Leonard was on the court more frequently last season, playing the most games (68) and minutes (2,330) since his San Antonio days in 2017. It resulted in the most efficient year of his career and, ultimately, an All-NBA Second Team selection. All signs pointed to a healthy season until April 1 when Leonard was shut down by the Clippers due to right knee inflammation. He was out for three full weeks before returning for Game 2 of the postseason, but never looked explosive or ready for the speed and intensity that playoff action demands. The Clippers are hoping an extended break will have him ready to go in October as Leonard’s three-year, $150 million contract kicks in. Follow me on Twitter.

This is a particularly good day to listen to the advice of others who are older or more experienced. (At least, listen.) Taurus (April 20-May 20) You can learn a lot today.

                    "text": "General Daily Insight for July 10, 2024 Our perception may start out skewed, but we’ll be brought back down to earth. The emotional Moon squares expansive Jupiter, making our feelings take on a larger importance. This isn’t automatically bad, though it could tempt us to exaggerate or dramatize events if we’re not careful. We should feel sturdier once the confident Sun trines dedicated Saturn at 11:05 pm EDT, improving our self-confidence and personal discipline. We need to take responsibility for how we feel and ensure our reactions align with reality. Aries March 21 – April 19 What’s in your head might not be in line with what’s really going on. You could be stressed, frustrated, and telling everybody about everything wrong, but they may not understand what you mean. From their perspective, you likely have it more together than you think you do. Even so, a listening ear should feel really nice. They may also notice sources of support you hadn’t thought to utilize before. Regardless, any ongoing issues are not the end of the world. You will make it through! Taurus April 20 – May 20 You may be feeling stubborn about your decisions. Risks that you took in the past might be playing on your mind, spurring you forward to make the decisions that you’re making in the present — no matter how different the situations are. Other people may be wondering why you’re taking the steps that you’re taking. If someone mentions this to you, take it to heart. When you’re acting as if you were in that part of your history, remember: that was then, this is now. Gemini May 21 – June 20 This is the time to put your goals before your immediate desires. Everyone gets distracted sometimes, but it’s vital that you see past any recent shiny distractions. What have you been waiting to do for a long time? Consider writing it down and taking a picture of it, then setting that picture as your phone or computer background, so it’s always with you. A consistent reminder of your plans will stabilize your mind, making it that much easier to avoid life’s pitfalls. Cancer June 21 – July 22 Pessimism might be looming larger than it should. You may notice that you’re feeling more on edge out of nowhere, or you could be spiraling with anxiety regarding the outcome of a situation that’s showing no signs of going wrong. When you’re able to step into your power and say no to whatever fears are playing on your mind, you’ll be better able to be kind to yourself. Remember, what-if scenarios don’t always have to be negative — they can be positive, too! Leo July 23 – August 22 You might be on the receiving end of someone else’s emotional tidal wave. They might be going through some intense ebbs and flows that have them looking for a shoulder to cry on — or someone to blame. It may be that you’re acting as the voice of reason, but simply stating the facts isn’t the best path forward. Make an effort to be sensitive to what they’re going through. Neither of you has to be right or wrong for them to let healing in. Virgo August 23 – September 22 An authority figure may overreact, making it hard to respond. You might be unable to tell them outright that they’re overblowing the situation. On the other hand, you might not want to wait around and watch them make an emotional decision that they will regret. Consider trying to distract them or to cheer them up, because this could help them to take their focus away from their stress and improve their perspective in the process. Sometimes, it’s about what they’re not paying attention to. Libra September 23 – October 22 Information that you come across could be inflammatory, but it may not be completely true. Someone may tell you a particularly shocking piece of gossip or you could read a news article that has an incendiary headline. Keep in mind that the pieces of the story you see need more context before you consider analyzing the whole story. Make sure that you’re not letting your imagination fill in the gaps, because you might then spread misinformation to others. Research before you repeat. Scorpio October 23 – November 21 You don’t have to isolate yourself, Scorpio. A group of acquaintances or coworkers may have led you to feel like an outsider. While continuing your efforts to get to know them could feel awkward, it’s likely to get you further than avoiding them will. Your issues with them may actually stem from the fact that they don’t know you well enough yet, and you might be robbing them of the chance to get to know you if you run off quickly. Stay a while! Sagittarius November 22 – December 21 There’s a fine line between leading and controlling. It’s easy to see your way as the only right way at this time, no matter how right or wrong you are in the real world. This can embolden you to steamroll other people, when their collaboration could help you instead of derailing your plans. Heartfelt and intentional communication, with listening as well as talking, should allow you to understand each other’s point of view, rather than fighting for your way or the highway. Capricorn December 22 – January 19 Concealed enemies might be teaching you the wrong way to go. These shadowy antagonists may be intentionally thwarting you, or they could think they’re giving you good advice, but in reality, they’re projecting their desires onto you in an effort to see you live out their dreams or follow in their footsteps. No matter what their motivation is, it’s important to remember that those who know you best should encourage you to do what you love, not what they’d love you to do. Aquarius January 20 – February 18 You might be taking less of a risk than you think you are. Even if you are genuinely going on a limb socially, professionally, or personally, take a look beneath you — there’s probably a safety net in one form or another. Of course, it’s okay to be intimidated by doing something unfamiliar, but you shouldn’t let that stop you from trying. You’ve got more to offer than you know! Take a deep breath and own your unique energy as you chase your ambitions. Pisces February 19 – March 20 Emotional tension can make it challenging to know how to feel. You might be going through a lot of complex feelings, possibly due to your connection with someone else, but remember — this storm won’t last forever. Whether this connection is with a family member, a friend, or a love interest, know that you are capable of resolving whatever struggles you’re going through at the moment. Take a minute to breathe and let the emotions pass through you instead of getting stuck within them. Most Related Links : World News EraFinance News Source link",

                    "title": "Best Savings Rates Today &#8212; Snag a High APY Ahead of Inflation Data, July 10, 2024",
                    "text": "Right now, the top high-yield savings accounts earn annual percentage yields, or APYs, up to 5.55%. But the clock is ticking. Whether the Fed moves to cut rates at its upcoming Federal Open Market Committee on July 30-31 largely hinges on the June Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index coming out this week, according to Ed Mahaffy, president and senior portfolio manager at ClientFirst Wealth Management. “Although the consensus is for the Fed to begin cutting rates in September, if CPI and PPI fall appreciably, the Fed may cut rates at the July FOMC meeting,” said Mahaffy. So, whether you want to grow your emergency fund or save up for a big purchase, now’s the time to take advantage of high APYs while they’re still around. Experts recommend comparing rates before opening a savings account to get the best APY possible. You can enter your information below to see CNET’s partners’ rates in your area. Today’s best savings rates Here are some of the top savings account APYs available right now: How the Fed impacts savings rates The Fed doesn’t directly impact savings rates, but its decisions have ripple effects on the everyday consumer. When the Fed raises the federal funds rate -- the interest rate US banks use to lend or borrow money to each other overnight -- banks tend to increase their rates for savings accounts. Inversely, when the Fed lowers rates, banks drop savings rates, too. Keep in mind savings rates are variable, which means banks can change the rate on your savings account at any time. What to know about savings rates this week High savings rates have been the story for the better part of the last two years as the Fed regularly hiked rates to fight record inflation. However, as inflation began to show signs of cooling in late 2023, the Fed opted to maintain its target range of 5.25% to 5.5% at its last seven Federal Open Market Committee meetings. As a result, savings rates have remained attractive, barely budging as banks anticipate the Fed’s next move. In fact, we haven’t seen any changes to the accounts we track since EverBank dropped the rate on its high-yield savings account on May 31 from 5.15% APY to 5.05% APY. Experts anticipate rate drops before the end of the year, which means savings rates are likely to drop, too. While some expect rate drops as soon as July, others are hesitant to say a rate cut could happen that soon. “For the Federal Reserve to consider lowering interest rates, they need to see a continued drop in inflation and assurance that it will not rise again,” said Anthony Saccaro, president at Providence Financial and Insurance Services. “Currently, the economic data does not justify a rate cut.” Based on CNET’s weekly tracking, here’s where rates stand compared to last week: Why you should open a high-yield savings account today High-yield savings accounts provide a low-risk way to grow your savings while taking advantage of compound interest. Compound interest can help your money grow faster because you aren’t just earning interest on your initial deposit -- your interest also earns interest. Here’s what else makes HYSAs stand out: High rates: HYSAs often have APYs 10 times higher (or more) than the national average, as tracked by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Low or no fees: Monthly maintenance fees can eat into your savings. Many online banks can charge low or no fees thanks to their lower operating costs. Liquidity: You can access money in your HYSA anytime without penalty (as long as you mind any withdrawal limits). Accessibility: If you open an HYSA at an online bank, you’ll have 24/7 access through its mobile app. You may also have lots of customer service options, including by phone, online chat and secure messaging. Low risk: HYSAs are protected by federal deposit insurance if they’re held at an FDIC-insured bank or credit union insured by the National Credit Union Administration. That means your money is safe up to $250,000 per account holder, per account type. How to find the right savings account Though a high APY is important, you should consider more than just the APY before opening a high-yield savings account. “Some accounts have mandatory minimums, transaction fees or other charges you might not expect,” said Ben McLaughlin, chief marketing officer and president of digital savings marketplace Raisin.“ These hidden fees can chip away at your savings, so be sure you are satisfied with the terms and conditions before opening an account.” Consider the following to find an account that complements your financial goals: Minimum deposit requirements: Some HYSAs require a minimum amount to open an account -- typically, from $25 to $100. Others don’t require anything. ATM access: Not every bank offers cash deposits and withdrawals. If you need regular ATM access, check to see if your bank offers ATM fee reimbursements or a wide range of in-network ATMs. Fees: Look out for fees for monthly maintenance, withdrawals and paper statements. These charges can eat into your balance. Accessibility: If you prefer in-person assistance, look for a bank with physical branches. If you’re comfortable managing your money digitally, consider an online bank. Withdrawal limits: Some banks charge an excess withdrawal fee if you make more than six monthly withdrawals. If you think you may need to make more, consider a bank without this limit. Federal deposit insurance: Make sure your bank or credit union is either insured with the FDIC or the NCUA.

This tool features partner rates from lenders that you can use when comparing multiple mortgage rates. Refinance rate news When mortgage rates hit historic lows during the pandemic, there was a refinancing boom, as homeowners were able to nab lower interest rates. But with current average mortgage rates around 7%, getting a new home loan isn’t as financially viable. Early in the year, hopes were high for a summer rate cut from the Fed. But over the past few months, inflation has remained high and the labor market strong, making it clear to investors that the Fed will take longer than expected to lower rates. Higher mortgage rates make refinancing less attractive to homeowners, making them more likely to hold onto their existing mortgages. Refinance rate predictions “The odds are good that rates will end 2024 lower than they are now,” said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of mortgage site, HSH.com. But predicting exactly where mortgage rates will end up is difficult because it hinges on economic data we don’t yet have. If inflation continues to improve and the Fed is able to cut rates, mortgage refinance rates could end the year between 6% and 6.5%. But data showing higher inflation could cause investors to reconsider the likelihood of Fed rate cuts and send mortgage rates higher, according to Orphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow Home Loans. If you’re considering a refinance, remember that you can’t time the economy: Interest rates fluctuate on an hourly, daily and weekly basis, and are influenced by an array of factors. Your best move is to keep an eye on day-to-day rate changes and have a game plan on how to capitalize on a big enough percentage drop, said Matt Graham of Mortgage News Daily. What to know about refinancing When you refinance your mortgage, you take out another home loan that pays off your initial mortgage. With a traditional refinance, your new home loan will have a different term and/or interest rate. With a cash-out refinance, you’ll tap into your equity with a new loan that’s bigger than your existing mortgage balance, allowing you to pocket the difference in cash. Refinancing can be a great financial move if you score a low rate or can pay off your home loan in less time, but consider whether it’s the right choice for you. Reducing your interest rate by 1% or more is an incentive to refinance, allowing you to cut your monthly payment significantly. How to select the right refinance type and term The rates advertised online often require specific conditions for eligibility. Your personal interest rate will be influenced by market conditions as well as your specific credit history, financial profile and application. Having a high credit score, a low credit utilization ratio and a history of consistent and on-time payments will generally help you get the best interest rates. 30-year fixed-rate refinance The current average interest rate for a 30-year refinance is 6.98%, a decrease of 5 basis points over this time last week. (A basis point is equivalent to 0.01%.) A 30-year fixed refinance will typically have lower monthly payments than a 15-year or 10-year refinance, but it will take you longer to pay off and typically cost you more in interest over the long term. 15-year fixed-rate refinance The current average interest rate for 15-year refinances is 6.51%, a decrease of 5 basis points compared to one week ago. Though a 15-year fixed refinance will most likely raise your monthly payment compared to a 30-year loan, you’ll save more money over time because you’re paying off your loan quicker. Also, 15-year refinance rates are typically lower than 30-year refinance rates, which will help you save more in the long run. 10-year fixed-rate refinance The average rate for a 10-year fixed refinance loan is currently 6.40%, a decrease of 9 basis points from what we saw the previous week. A 10-year refinance typically has the lowest interest rate but the highest monthly payment of all refinance terms. A 10-year refinance can help you pay off your house much quicker and save on interest, but make sure you can afford the steeper monthly payment. To get the best refinance rates, make your application as strong as possible by getting your finances in order, using credit responsibly and monitoring your credit regularly. And don’t forget to speak with multiple lenders and shop around. When to consider a mortgage refinance Homeowners usually refinance to save money, but there are other reasons to do so. Here are the most common reasons homeowners refinance: To get a lower interest rate: If you can secure a rate that’s at least 1% lower than the one on your current mortgage, it could make sense to refinance. To switch the type of mortgage: If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage and want greater security, you could refinance to a fixed-rate mortgage. To eliminate mortgage insurance: If you have an FHA loan that requires mortgage insurance, you can refinance to a conventional loan once you have 20% equity. To change the length of a loan term: Refinancing to a longer loan term could lower your monthly payment. Refinancing to a shorter term will save you interest in the long run. To tap into your equity through a cash-out refinance: If you replace your mortgage with a larger loan, you can receive the difference in cash to cover a large expense. To take someone off the mortgage: In case of divorce, you can apply for a new home loan in just your name and use the funds to pay off your existing mortgage.",

The average rate for a 15-year fixed mortgage is 6.48%, which is a decrease of -0.06% since last week. For a look at mortgage rate movement, see the chart below. The Federal Reserve has been pushing off interest rate cuts because inflation has been slow to improve. While experts still expect mortgage rates to gradually move lower in the coming months, housing market predictions can always change in response to economic data, geopolitical events and more. Mortgage rates constantly change, but there’s a good chance they’ll fall this year. To get the lowest rate, shop around and compare offers from different lenders. Enter your information below to get a custom quote from one of CNET’s partner lenders. About these rates: Like CNET, Bankrate is owned by Red Ventures. This tool features partner rates from lenders that you can use when comparing multiple mortgage rates. What are the different mortgage types? Each mortgage has a loan term, or payment schedule. The most common mortgage terms are 15 and 30 years, although 10-, 20- and 40-year mortgages also exist. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate is set for the duration of the loan, offering stability. With an adjustable-rate mortgage, the interest rate is only fixed for a certain amount of time (commonly five, seven or 10 years), after which the rate adjusts annually based on the market. Fixed-rate mortgages are a better option if you plan to live in a home in the long term, but adjustable-rate mortgages may offer lower interest rates upfront. 30-year fixed-rate mortgages The average interest rate for a standard 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.98% today. A 30-year fixed mortgage is the most common loan term. It will often have a higher interest rate than a 15-year mortgage, but you’ll have a lower monthly payment. 15-year fixed-rate mortgages Today, the average rate for a 15-year, fixed mortgage is 6.48%. Though you’ll have a bigger monthly payment than a 30-year fixed mortgage, a 15-year loan usually comes with a lower interest rate, allowing you to pay less interest in the long run and pay off your mortgage sooner. 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgages A 5/1 ARM has an average rate of 6.52% today. You’ll typically get a lower introductory interest rate with a 5/1 ARM in the first five years of the mortgage. But you could pay more after that period, depending on how the rate adjusts annually. If you plan to sell or refinance your house within five years, an ARM could be a good option. What should I know about mortgage rates today? At the start of the pandemic, mortgage rates were near record lows, around 3%. That all changed as inflation began to surge and the Federal Reserve kicked off a series of aggressive interest rate hikes starting in March 2022 to slow the economy, which indirectly drove up mortgage rates. Now, more than two years later, mortgage rates are still around 7%. Over the last several months, mortgage rates have fluctuated in response to economic data and investors’ expectations as to when the Fed will start to lower rates. Today’s homebuyers have less room in their budget to afford the cost of a home due to elevated mortgage rates and steep home prices. Limited housing inventory and low wage growth are also contributing to the affordability crisis and keeping mortgage demand down. Mortgage predictions for 2024 Most experts predict mortgage rates will fall below 7% in the coming months. However, a sustained downward trend will depend on several factors, including upcoming inflation and labor data. The Fed hasn’t hiked interest rates in almost a year, but an actual rate cut doesn’t appear imminent. Some experts say the first cut could come as early as July, though it’s more likely we see the Fed lower rates in September or November. “If the Fed makes any moves later this year, the signal would be sufficient for the mortgage market, and mortgage rates would start falling,” said Selma Hepp, chief economist at CoreLogic. “In that case, we could see the mortgage rates around 6.5% at the year-end.” One thing is for sure: Homebuyers won’t see lower mortgage overnight, and a return to the 2-3% mortgage rates from just a few years ago is unlikely. Here’s a look at where some major housing authorities expect average mortgage rates to land. Calculate your monthly mortgage payment Getting a mortgage should always depend on your financial situation and long-term goals. The most important thing is to make a budget and try to stay within your means. CNET’s mortgage calculator below can help homebuyers prepare for monthly mortgage payments. Where can I find the best mortgage rates? Though mortgage rates and home prices are high, the housing market won’t be unaffordable forever. It’s always a good time to save for a down payment and improve your credit score to help you secure a competitive mortgage rate when the time is right. Save for a bigger down payment: Though a 20% down payment isn’t required, a larger upfront payment means taking out a smaller mortgage, which will help you save in interest. Boost your credit score: You can qualify for a conventional mortgage with a 620 credit score, but a higher score of at least 740 will get you better rates. Pay off debt: Experts recommend a debt-to-income ratio of 36% or less to help you qualify for the best rates. Not carrying other debt will put you in a better position to handle your monthly payments. Research loans and assistance: Government-sponsored loans have more flexible borrowing requirements than conventional loans. Some government-sponsored or private programs can also help with your down payment and closing costs. Shop around for lenders: Researching and comparing multiple loan offers from different lenders can help you secure the lowest mortgage rate for your situation.",

Today’s best CD rates Here are some of the top CD rates available right now and how much you could earn by depositing $5,000 right now: How inflation and Fed decisions affect CD rates CD rates are significantly impacted by where the Fed sets the federal funds rate, which determines how much it costs banks to borrow and lend money to each other. When the Fed raises this rate, banks tend to raise APYs on consumer products like savings accounts and CDs to boost their cash reserves and stay competitive. When the Fed cuts this rate, APYs on these products drop, too. Beginning in March 2022, the Fed raised the federal funds rate 11 times to combat record-high inflation, and CD rates skyrocketed, with some accounts offering APYs over 5.5% heading into fall 2023. But as inflation began to show signs of cooling, the Fed paused rates at its September 2023 meeting -- and every meeting since then. As a result, CD rates plateaued and then began dropping as experts predicted rate cuts in the second half of 2024. How much longer can you enjoy high CD rates? CD rates have held relatively steady as banks awaited and then responded to the Fed’s June decision to pause rates for the seventh consecutive time. Here’s where CD rates stand compared to last week: But experts anticipate at least one rate cut later this year, which means today’s CD rates may be the best you’ll get for the remainder of 2024. The timing of Fed cuts depends on where inflation stands when the Fed meets next. The next Consumer Price Index report, which measures inflation rate changes, comes out on July 11. “The Fed is starting to get the economic data they feel is needed to justify one rate cut for this year,” said Faron Daugs, CFP, founder and CEO at Harrison Wallace Financial Group. “I believe it will be after the election. However, if new data continues to indicate that inflation is easing, we could see a cut at the September meeting. There is a risk of looking too political by doing this in September, but it could just hinge on upcoming data as to the timing of a cut.” Top reasons to open a CD now Whenever the Fed begins cutting rates, one thing is certain: Opening a CD today allows you to lock in a high APY and protect your earnings from rate drops when they happen. But a fixed rate isn’t the only perk you’ll enjoy by opening a CD today. CDs are insured up to $250,000 per person, per bank, when they’re provided by a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or a credit union insured by the National Credit Union Administration. That means your money is safe up to the deposit limits if the bank fails. In addition, CDs are low-risk. Unlike investments like stocks, you won’t lose your principal deposit or the interest you’ve earned unless you run into early withdrawal penalties -- which you can easily avoid by choosing the right term for your needs. How to choose the right CD for you A competitive APY is important, but there are other things you should consider when comparing CD accounts: When you’ll need your money: Early withdrawal penalties can reduce your interest earnings. So, be sure to choose a term that fits your savings timeline. “I recommend whatever term you are comfortable with having locked up as long as you don’t need that money to be liquid for the duration of the term,” said Dana Menard, CFP, founder and lead financial planner at Twin Cities Wealth Strategies. Alternatively, you can select a no-penalty CD, although the APY may not be as high as you’d get with a traditional CD of the same term. Minimum deposit requirement: Some CDs require a minimum amount to open an account -- typically, $500 to $1,000. Others do not. How much money you have to set aside can help you narrow down your options. Fees: Maintenance and other fees can eat into your earnings. Many online banks don’t charge fees because they have lower overhead costs than banks with physical branches. Still, read the fine print for any account you’re evaluating. Federal deposit insurance: Make sure any institution you’re considering is an FDIC or NCUA member so your money is protected if the bank fails. Customer ratings and reviews: Visit sites like Trustpilot to see what customers are saying about any bank you’re considering. You want a bank that’s responsive, professional and easy to work with.

                    "text": "In When Harry Met Sally, Harry meets Sally during a road trip from Chicago to New York City. It’s one of the most famous (and quotable) meet-cutes in movie history. We Live in Time, the new film from Brooklyn director John Crowley, also has a vehicular-based meet-cute, except instead of discussing whether men and women can be friends, Florence Pugh hits Andrew Garfield with her car. Hey, whatever works. The decade-spanning A24 film stars Pugh and Garfield as Almut and Tobias, who hit it off following the, uh, accident. “Through snapshots of their life together — falling for each other, building a home, becoming a family — a difficult truth is revealed that rocks its foundation,” the official plot synopsis reads. “As they embark on a path challenged by the limits of time, they learn to cherish each moment of the unconventional route their love story has taken.” There’s happiness (they have a kid together), sadness (she appears to get diagnosed with cancer), and romantic strolls in the park together. You can watch the trailer above. “Oh my god, I’m excited about that movie,” Pugh told ET Online about We Live in Time. “That one, we just had the most beautiful time making it — we made a real story about real people and I got to work with the most unbelievable actor that I feel so honored to be in his presence and shout lines back to him.” We Live in Time opens in theaters on October 11.",

                    "text": "The on-screen romance between Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh starts with a crash. A24 has released the first trailer for We Live in Time, which shows their characters meeting under unusual circumstances. Tobias (Garfield) awakens in a hospital bed with a neck brace, wondering where his underpants are, as Almut (Pugh) reassures him from across the room. “So sorry, but do we know each other?” he asks. She struggles to answer. “Ye– no, um…” We then see a Mini Cooper slamming into a pedestrian on the road. “I ran you over. Sorry,” she whispers. “It’s all right,” he responds. In a scene that looks like it takes place after a passionate night together, Tobias stands pantsless in Almut’s house, saying, “Probably ought to get going.” Almut tries to convince him to stay: “Who says? Unless you have s--- to do, then…” “I have nothing,” he responds, relieved. From there, the trailer rapidly cuts between glimpses of happy moments between the two characters, including a walk in the park, a dinner party, and a kiss in the kitchen. “Whether we like it or not, the clock is ticking,” Tobias says. “What’s the rush?” Almut asks. “Because I am worried that there’s a very distinct and real possibility that I am about to fall in love with you.” The highs and lows become far more dramatic: Almut sits in a doctor’s office with a shaved head, suggesting a serious medical diagnosis, and also discovers she’s pregnant in a scene from earlier in the timeline. We also see the couple riding carnival rides, giving birth, dancing in a club, ice skating, and playing with their young daughter. “I’m not interested in a treatment that accidentally wastes our time,” Almut says as Tobias shaves her head. It seems that she later has a change of heart, though, as her partner asks, “Why are you taking the risk?” and she tearfully replies, “I can’t bear the thought of being forgotten.” The trailer ends on a lighter note, with Tobias struggling to exit a tight parallel parking spot and slamming into the car ahead of him. Based on the tearjerking tone of the rest of the footage, it’s entirely possible that this is the only moment of levity in the entire film. “Making this movie was such an unbelievably beautiful experience,” Pugh wrote in a post sharing the film’s poster on Instagram Tuesday. “I’m thrilled and proud to say that it’s nearly here for all of you to watch soon.” The film from Brooklyn's John Crowley is Pugh’s latest in an impressive run of high-profile projects, which has included Midsommar, Little Women, Black Widow, Don’t Worry Darling, Oppenheimer, and Dune: Part Two. Meanwhile, Garfield recently received an Oscar nomination for his performance in Tick, Tick… Boom!, an Emmy nod for his work in Under the Banner of Heaven, and played a key role in Spider-Man: No Way Home, which currently stands as the seventh highest grossing movie of all time at the worldwide box office. We Live in Time hits theaters October 11. Watch the full trailer above.",

                    "text": "If you were planning not to cry today, well, plans change. “We Live in Time,” a new romantic drama starring Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield, doesn’t open until October 11, but a brand-new trailer gives you a sense of just how much you’ll bawl your eyes out while watching it. You can view the trailer above. Pugh and Garfield play Almut and Tobias, characters who are brought together by circumstance (she accidentally runs him over with her car) and end up forging a deep romantic relationship. The trailer ping-pongs around in time; you see them talking to their young daughter, going through an extremely difficult medical situation and also engaging in the typical meet-cute-adjacent romantic comedy tropes too. By the end of the trailer, you will probably be choking back a few tears. Let them out. It’ll be good for you. The movie also stars Adam James, Marama Corlett, Aoife Hinds, Heather Craney and Kara Lynch. It was written by Nick Payne, who worked on “The Crown,” and was produced by Leah Clarke, Adam Ackland and Guy Heeley. The music was composed by Bryce Dessner, the National member and frequent Taylor Swift collaborator, who also composed the music for A24’s “Sing Sing” (coming out later this month). “We Live in Time” was directed by John Crowley, who worked with Garfield on “Boy A” and who last directed “The Goldfinch,” the adaptation of the beloved Donna Tartt bestseller. The movie will make its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival This fall, before arriving in theaters on October 11.",

                    "text": "A24 is bringing Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh together for a long-lasting romance. On Wednesday, July 10, the indie distributor debuted the trailer for the pair's upcoming romance film We Live in Time, which stars Garfield, 40, and Pugh, 28, as a couple telling their daughter the story of their relationship. After an initial rendezvous, Almut (Pugh) and Tobias' (Garfield) relationship gets to a fast start, with Tobias admitting quickly that he believes he is falling in love with her. The trailer appears to follow both characters over a number of years, through the couple's pregnancy and raising a daughter together — and Almut appears to grow ill at some point along the way. \"Almut and Tobias are brought together in a surprise encounter that changes their lives,\" reads an official synopsis for the movie. \"As they embark on a path challenged by the limits of time, they learn to cherish each moment of the unconventional route their love story has taken, in filmmaker John Crowley's decade-spanning, deeply moving romance.\" Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Pugh first confirmed that she and Garfield would costar in a movie together during a March 2023 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, just weeks after she and Garfield presented together at the 2023 Oscars earlier that month. In May 2023, the pair were seen spending time together in Rome, just after Pugh wrote on Instagram that she had completed filming for We Live in Time that same week. \"You know what's crazy is that we — they didn't know we were doing a movie together,\" Pugh told host Jimmy Fallon during that March 2023 appearance. \"Well I don't think they did. But this was — I think, a bit of an accident. Which is even weirder!\" Filmmaker Crowley's last film was 2019's The Goldfinch. He is also known for directing the 2015 drama Brooklyn, starring Saoirse Ronan. We Live in Time is in theaters October 11.",

That chance encounter changes their lives over decades as they find romance, build a home and family together and face a host of challenges on their way. With their relationship still apparently fresh, Tobias (Garfield) at one point in the trailer, having shed his neck brace after his car accident injuries, tells Almut (Pugh) that he must leave, only to be asked why he’s in a rush. “Because I’m worried there’s a very distinct and real possibility that I’m about to fall in love with you,” he answers, before they embrace passionately. Along with the birth of a child, Almut faces her own health crisis at another point in the trailer, which has Tobias now at her side in support. Ultimately, Almut and Tobias face a difficult truth that rocks the foundation of their world in a teaser that doesn’t disclose their secret, but is equally light and dark in parts as snapshots of their life together unfold. Pugh as an Oscar nominee has screen credits that include Don’t Worry Darling, the Netflix period drama The Wonder, A Good Person, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Dune: Part Two. Garfield appeared in the miniseries Under the Banner of Heaven and earned his own Oscar nomination for Tick, Tick … Boom! StudioCanal is behind the feature helmed by Crowley, the director behind the romance drama Brooklyn and Garfield’s break-out role Boy A. He directed We Live in Time from a screenplay by playwright Nick Payne, with SunnyMarch as a producer. Producers credits on We Live in Time are shared by Adam Ackland, Leah Clarke, Benedict Cumberbatch and Guy Heeley.",

The film, helmed by Brooklyn director John Crowley, stars the two British actors as a couple brought together by near-tragedy — Pugh’s Almut hits Garfield’s Tobias with her car — and, after a decade-long relationship that includes a child together, they are potentially torn apart when Almut is struck by illness. “Every minute counts,” the film’s tagline states. “Almut (Florence Pugh) and Tobias (Andrew Garfield) are brought together in a surprise encounter that changes their lives,” the film’s synopsis states. “As they embark on a path challenged by the limits of time, they learn to cherish each moment of the unconventional route their love story has taken, in filmmaker John Crowley’s decade-spanning, deeply moving romance.” A24 will release We Live in Time “this fall,” with Variety reporting an October 11 theatrical release; prior to its arrival, the film will debut at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. Additionally, the film’s poster reveals that the National’s Bryce Dessner composed the score for We Live in Time. Benedict Cumberbatch also serves as an executive producer on the movie, which was first revealed in 2023 when Pugh and Garfield presented together at the Academy Awards; later that year, Pugh appeared at the Met Gala with a recently shaved head, which she did for her role in this film.",

Later, when he asks why she’s taking a risk, Almut responds, “I can’t bear the thought of being forgotten.” We Live in Time was written by Nick Payne and directed by two-time BAFTA winner John Crowley, who helmed the Oscar-nominated Brooklyn.

The film provides glimpses into their love story and some of the issues that they face over the course of their romance.

                    "text": "Gypsy Rose Blanchard, who recruited her former boyfriend to kill her mother after years of being forced to pretend she was gravely ill, announced Tuesday that she is pregnant and hopes to give her child everything she lacked growing up. Blanchard said in a YouTube video that the baby is due in January, which will be just a little over a year after she was freed from a women's prison northeast of Kansas City, Missouri. \"I just want to be a good mother for my child,\" she said, her voice catching. \"I want to be everything my mother wasn’t.\" GYPSY ROSE BLANCHARD BECOMES OVERNIGHT INTERNET STAR AFTER PRISON RELEASE Blanchard’s case sparked national tabloid interest after reports emerged that her mother, Clauddine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard, who was slain in 2015, had essentially kept her daughter prisoner, forcing her to use a wheelchair and feeding tube. Dee Dee Blanchard duped doctors into doing unnecessary procedures by telling them that her daughter’s medical records had been lost in Hurricane Katrina, Gypsy Rose Blanchard's attorney said. The attorney said the mother had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a psychological disorder in which parents or caregivers seek sympathy through the exaggerated or made-up illnesses of their children. The mother-daughter duo received charitable donations, and even a home near Springfield, Missouri, from Habitat for Humanity. When Gypsy Rose Blanchard turned 23, she supplied a knife to her then-boyfriend, and hid in a bathroom while he repeatedly stabbed her mother, according to the probable cause statement. Then Gypsy and Nicholas Godejohn, whom she met on a Christian dating website, made their way by bus to Godejohn’s home in Wisconsin, where they were arrested. Godejohn is serving a life sentence in Missouri. Prosecutors cut Blanchard a deal because of the abuse she had endured. Ultimately she found a way to forgive her mother and herself, she said soon after her release while promoting the Lifetime docuseries, \"The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard,\" and her own e-book, \"Released: Conversations on the Eve of Freedom.\" Earlier coverage includes the 2017 HBO documentary \"Mommy Dead and Dearest\" and the 2019 Hulu miniseries \"The Act.\" Blanchard said in the new video that she knows some people think she isn’t ready to be a mother, that it is too soon. But she was dismissive, saying no one is ever truly ready for parenthood. \"It’s an amazing feeling when your whole world shifts and suddenly it’s not about you,\" she said. \"It’s not about anything other than this tiny little life that’s inside you that you are now in charge of protecting. And that little tiny life is a baby, a little tiny human that’s yours and that you have to make sure that you protect, you love, you take care of. And all of the things that I wish I could have had when I was little.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP She said the baby’s father is Ken Urker, a prison pen pal who proposed when Blanchard was incarcerated. They later broke up, and she instead married Ryan Scott Anderson, a special education teacher from Lake Charles, Louisiana. Soon after her release from prison, however, Blanchard and Anderson split, and now she is back with Urker. Blanchard said the pregnancy wasn't planned but both she and Urker are excited and committed to creating a family together. \"I couldn't be happier,\" she said, while acknowledging that the relationship is unconventional. \"Everything that has ever happened to me in my life suddenly doesn’t matter because it all led me to be who I am today and it all led me to this moment right here, right now. And that’s a blessing.\"",

                    "text": "(CNN) — Gypsy Rose Blanchard, who served eight and a half years for helping to kill her abusive mother, announced Tuesday that she is set to become a mother herself. Blanchard shared the news on social media that and her ex-fiancé, Ken Urker, are expecting their first child. “We’re both very excited,” she said in a YouTube video. “This was not planned at all. It was completely unexpected, but we’re both very excited to take on this new journey of parenthood.” Blanchard said her life has shifted now that she’s expecting and she no longer cares about “drama.” “Suddenly it’s not about you,” she said. “It’s not about anything other than the tiny little life that’s inside you that you are now in charge of protecting.” “And that little tiny life is a baby, a little tiny human that’s yours,” she added as she got emotional. “That you have to make sure you protect, you love, you take care of and all of the things that I wished I could have had when I was little.” Blanchard spent her childhood and early adulthood believing she suffered from a host of medical ailments, including leukemia, muscular dystrophy and asthma, when in reality she was a victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a rare syndrome in which a caregiver feigns or exaggerates illness in someone to elicit attention or sympathy. The young woman became the subject of tabloid fascination after her mother Dee Dee Blanchard was found stabbed to death in 2015 in their home near Springfield, Missouri. An investigation uncovered not only the elder Blanchard’s role in her daughter’s childhood of feigned illnesses, but also the fact that her daughter convinced her then-boyfriend Nicholas Godejohn to kill her mother as she slept as a way to escape the abuse. Gypsy Rose Blanchard pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 2016. Prosecutors eventually sentenced her to 10 years in a plea deal due to the unique circumstances. She was released in December 2023 and told CNN soon after “For me, getting to prison was a chance to start a life for myself in terms of gaining independence from everyone.” Media attention has continued since her release. She and Urker met and got engaged while she was in prison but split in 2022. Soon after their breakup, Blanchard married Louisiana teacher Ryan Anderson in a prison wedding ceremony in July 2022 before parting ways in March. She and Urker then rekindled their romance. Blanchard said they look forward to welcoming their baby in January. The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.",

                    "text": "Gypsy Rose Blanchard and her ex-fiancé-turned-current boyfriend Ken Urker's lives took an unexpected turn on May 24. That day, the couple found out that Blanchard is pregnant. The two conceived a month earlier after they were seen together holding hands, cuddling and kissing at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival on April 29. \"I was very surprised,\" Blanchard, 32, tells PEOPLE over Zoom on Tuesday, July 9 — just a few hours after she announced she was expecting her first baby in a tearful YouTube video. She says she is 11 weeks along and her due date is in January of next year. After taking a pregnancy test at her father Rod and Kristy's home in Cut Off, La., Blanchard turned to her stepmother and asked her to read it. \"Can you make sure this test says what I think it says?\" she recalls asking. When she handed the test over, the second line was faintly pink. \"Girl, you're pregnant,\" Kristy told her with tears in her eyes. \"Oh my God,\" Blanchard recalls thinking. She had recently been to the doctor and believed she was having issues ovulating and couldn't conceive easily. \"I literally had taken that out of my mind as a possibility,\" she tells PEOPLE. Then, Blanchard took another test to be sure. It was positive again. \"I'm pregnant!\" she gasped, adding, \"My dad is going to kill me!\" Moments later, the two FaceTimed with Urker, 31, to tell him the exciting news. \"His face was priceless,\" Kristy tells PEOPLE over the phone. \"He just had a big smile on his face. It's such a blessing and it's still unreal. They will be great parents and cherish every minute of it,\" she adds. \"When they hold their baby for the first time, they won't be able to imagine their life without their child. Everything just melts away, even when she gets a lot of hate about it.\" Blanchard and Urker rekindled their relationship after having previously been engaged while Blanchard was incarcerated for her role in the murder of her mother Dee Dee Blanchard. After two years, the couple broke off their engagement in 2019, and Blanchard went on to marry Ryan Anderson in 2022 while she was still in prison. Blanchard, who was released in December 2023, filed for divorce from Anderson a few months later, in April. On June 3, Urker moved to Louisiana from Texas to be closer to Blanchard. \"I'm not going to say that I think that a baby will help a marriage or a relationship, because obviously there's the added stress. I know that realistically, there's going to be arguments too,\" says Blanchard. \"But [Ken and I] both come from divorced parents and one thing we absolutely agreed on from day one, even back when we were dating in 2017, is that when we have a child, we will stick together for the long haul. This is a forever thing because we don't want our child to grow up in a broken home.\" Blanchard, who was the victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy at the hands of her mother, says she has reflected on what kind of mother she wants to be. \"I want to be kind, that my kids come to me for any kind of advice, just like my stepmother,\" she says. \"I have seen how she has parented her children — and I think she's a kick-ass mom. She's supportive and not overbearing. She lets her kids find their dreams while also being able to pick up the pieces when those dreams fall apart sometimes — so that's kind of the mantra I want to live by.\" For decades, Blanchard's mother Dee Dee harmed and controlled her. She was subjected to painful medical abuse and spent years being told she had serious illnesses, including leukemia and muscular dystrophy. Blanchard also claimed that she was chained to the bed for weeks after she tried to escape. Now, she wants to be everything her mother Dee Dee wasn't. \"All the things that I wanted in a mother, I want to give to this baby,\" she says. \"My mother told me I was never going to get married, raise a family, have kids or do any of that. So, to be here, standing on my own two feet and expecting my first baby, that's something I've reached as an achievement and a personal goal. I thank God every day that I am now having this second chance at life with a kid of my own.\" Blanchard continues, \"The way my mother parented me is definitely not the way I'm going to be. We always say for the next generation, we want to be better than we were raised. And so, for me, I think that couldn't be any more truthful. \"I have learned from the experience of the trauma of everything not to do.\" Last month, Blanchard had been struggling with auditory nightmares of her mom. While Kristy was sound asleep, Blanchard heard screaming in the middle of the day. \"She said she heard this scary scream, but I didn't hear anything. It was quiet in the house and outside. She came in worried checking on me, but she was really scared,\" Kristy explains. The two immediately embraced and hugged each other. \"I told her, 'I'll always be here for you.' Gypsy often had nightmares of getting out of prison and her mom would be there. It happened a lot. As far as I know, the scream she heard was of her mother,\" she continues. \"It breaks my heart. But I will always be there for her, Ken and the new baby.\" In 2016, Blanchard pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for conspiring with her ex-boyfriend Nicholas “Nick” Godejohn, whom she met online, to kill her 48-year-old mother. Dee Dee was stabbed to death in her Springfield, Mo., home on June 9, 2015, as Gypsy waited in the bathroom. Godejohn is currently serving life in prison. \"That's not something that will go away overnight,\" Blanchard says of the crime. \"That is a forever journey of forgiveness that I will be on. I have not made peace with what happened. That's something that I'm working toward in therapy, but nobody could put a timestamp on when that healing will be done or will happen or when I'll feel better about something. It's a forever process.\" During a recent episode of Lifetime's Gypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up, which airs on Mondays, Blanchard told her stepsister Mia that she wasn't ready for motherhood. At the time — while still with Anderson — she thought she could be pregnant with his child but wasn't ready to start a family with him. By March, the couple were at odds and had a bitter fight, according to what Blanchard's friend Nadiya Vizier previously shared with PEOPLE. Mia, a college student studying to be a nurse, encouraged Blanchard to take an emergency contraceptive. \"I don't regret taking my sister's advice at all,\" says Blanchard. \"I'm happy I took it. With everything that was going on with Ryan and me and the instability of our marriage, it wasn't the right time for me then.\" \"She definitely wasn't ready with Ryan,\" Kristy tells PEOPLE. \"She wouldn't have taken Plan B if she was. We all know Gypsy is going to do what she wants at the end of the day. I mean, who doesn't?\" Anderson told PEOPLE in May that he was \"blinded by how fast the events took place.\" With their first divorce hearing on July 29, Blanchard says \"timing is not where we wanted it to be\" when it comes to the pregnancy. \"I'm still going through a divorce . . . However, I take it in stride, move forward and I couldn't be happier. With Ken, we were both very aware of this responsibility and I never felt like I didn't want to or couldn't take this on with him,\" she adds. \"We are going to do it together. We are going to be parents.\" Next month, Kristy and her daughter Mia are planning a sex reveal party for the couple. \"Gypsy did a blood test to know the gender, but neither wanted to know,\" she says. \"They wanted it to be a surprise. So, I'm the only one who knows the baby's sex right now.\" Blanchard says she would be happy with a boy or a girl. \"As long as the baby is healthy, I think that's what anybody would want.\" Her stepmother says the couple will likely raise the baby in her home until they can move in together when Blanchard's parole ends in 11 months. For about six months, she and Urker will travel back and forth between homes to care for their child. \"He's going to have to stay at my parents' house for a couple of days and vice versa. But until I'm off parole, I can't move in with him or us get a house. So, we'll have to work around that schedule.\" Today, Blanchard says she's focused on prioritizing her health and the baby's. \"I'm making sure I'm taking my prenatal vitamins and with the mood swings and the symptoms, I just haven't even had any extra time to even communicate with anyone,\" she says. \"I've been pretty busy. It was also tough to be tight-lipped about this. I wanted to announce it on my terms and in a certain way, but keeping this secret for so long was worrisome. I didn't want it to be leaked,\" she says. \"It would have robbed me of the joy of announcing it to my friends, family and ultimately the public.\" Blanchard says that although negativity often surrounds her on social media, she hasn't looked at any of the backlash to her pregnancy news. \"But listen, I understand where the public is coming from,\" she shrugs. \"I think every parent questions whether they're ready. I'm currently in therapy for my sanity and my mental well-being and I checked all the boxes to make sure I'm stable,\" she says. \"All I can say is that I have a strong support system, and Ken and I are in a very good place.\" Blanchard says that although she's nervous about potty training in the future, she's excited about seeing her baby's milestones. \"All those moments that you look at your life and you're like, 'Oh my God, it's like a flash,' \" she says. \"I can't wait to have those first steps, the first cry, the first scraped knee, all those firsts. That's the little milestones that I look forward to having,\" she says. \"I can't wait to be a mom.\" The season finale of Gypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up airs July 22 at 9/8c on Lifetime.",

                    "text": "For Kim Kardashian, there's no topic too difficult to handle — including Gypsy Rose Blanchard. In PEOPLE's exclusive sneak peek at Thursday's episode of The Kardashians, Kim made the trip to New Orleans for a one-on-one meeting with Gypsy. While discussing her incarceration, Gypsy reveals she had steak for the first time after her recent release before getting down to business. \"Well honestly, I've been following your case for a really long time,\" Kim begins. \"So, I wouldn't want to come in and really meet with someone that I feel like can really make an impact just for the sensation of the case.\" She acknowledges that the Life After Lockup star could \"make a big difference\" when it comes to prison reform because she can \"really articulate what you went through and how you can get through it.\" Gypsy returns her compliments and takes a moment to give Kim \"massive kudos\" for working with her and helping her get involved in prison reform. \"I think a lot of people are afraid of touching me as a topic, because I'm too controversial,\" she admits to Kim's surprise. Being no stranger to making headlines, Kim waves off Gypsy's reservations while she continues to give \"massive props for being like, 'okay, I'm going to come do this right now.' This is going to happen.\" Gypsy was charged with being involved with the killing of her mother Dee Dee in June 2015. Her then-boyfriend, Nick Godejohn, was also charged with the slaying at the time. After the arrests, it was discovered that Dee Dee subjected Gypsy to unnecessary medical treatments and convinced her daughter and others that her daughter had a litany of illnesses as a child. In court, it was argued Gypsy was a victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a form of child abuse that involves a guardian exaggerating or inducing illness to gain sympathy. Gypsy pleaded guilty in 2016 and was sentenced to 10 years in prison and was released in December 2023 after serving more than eight years in prison. In May, Gypsy opened up about her meeting with Kim and revealed that their meeting was really productive. \"First of all, meeting Kim was a huge honor,\" she told E! News. \"She's a really sweet woman and I really appreciate her taking the time to talk with me. We had a lot to talk about as far as prison reform goes. I know that she's done some really amazing things with prison reform. And that's really close to my heart because I've been on that side of the fence.\" Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

                    "text": "Breaking the cycle. Gypsy Rose Blanchard — who announced that she was pregnant and expecting her first baby with boyfriend Ken Urker on Tuesday — got candid about wanting to be a better mom than the one she had. “I want to be kind, that my kids come to me for any kind of advice, just like my stepmother,” she told People in an interview published Wednesday, referring to her dad Rod Blanchard’s wife, Kristy Blanchard. “I have seen how she has parented her children — and I think she’s a kick-ass mom. She’s supportive and not overbearing,” she added. Rod and Kristy share two kids: Mia and Dylan. “She lets her kids find their dreams while also being able to pick up the pieces when those dreams fall apart sometimes — so that’s kind of the mantra I want to live by.” Gypsy was convicted of second-degree murder for planning the 2015 death of her mom, Clauddine “Dee Dee” Blanchard, who suffered from Munchausen syndrome by proxy (now known as factitious disorder imposed on another). Considered to be a mental illness and a form of child abuse, FDIA happens when the caretaker of a child either makes up fake symptoms or causes real symptoms to make it look like the child is sick, per the Cleveland Clinic. In December 2023, Gypsy was released on parole after serving more than eight years behind bars. Though the “Released: Conversations on the Eve of Freedom” author didn’t have a great relationship with her mom, she said she wants to parent her baby differently. “All the things that I wanted in a mother, I want to give to this baby. My mother told me I was never going to get married, raise a family, have kids or do any of that,” she told the outlet. “So, to be here, standing on my own two feet and expecting my first baby, that’s something I’ve reached as an achievement and a personal goal. I thank God every day that I am now having this second chance at life with a kid of my own.” Gypsy added, “The way my mother parented me is definitely not the way I’m going to be. We always say for the next generation, we want to be better than we were raised. And so, for me, I think that couldn’t be any more truthful. “I have learned from the experience of the trauma of everything not to do.” The “Life After Lock Up” star and Urker, who were previously engaged from 2018 to 2019 while she was behind bars, made headlines when they reignited their romance just days after she announced her separation from husband Ryan Scott Anderson. Gypsy is due in January 2025.",

                    "text": "Gypsy-Rose Blanchard, who announced on Tuesday, July 9, that she is 11 weeks pregnant, says she \"immediately\" shared the news with her parole officer. Blanchard, 32, is expecting her first child with boyfriend Ken Urker in January 2025, she said in a YouTube video where she dropped the news of her pregnancy. \"This was not planned at all, it was completely unexpected, but we're both very excited to take on this new journey of parenthood,” she said in the video. Blanchard made the announcement a little more than six months after her release from prison where she served a sentence for her role in the murder of her abusive mother in 2015. A few hours after making the YouTube announcement, Blanchard spoke exclusively with PEOPLE, sharing details about her pregnancy journey — including a mention of her parole officer. \"I let my parole officer know that I was pregnant immediately when I found out, because I keep my parole officer in the loop about everything, even personal stuff,\" she says. \"But it doesn't affect anything to do with my parole,\" she adds. \"I am still on parole for another 11 months.\" Blanchard's time since her prison release has been marked by ups and downs of newfound freedom and decisions — from dyeing her hair to getting matching tattoos with Urker shortly after leaving her now-estranged husband Ryan Anderson, who she married while in prison. After announcing her separation from Anderson in March, Blanchard rekindled her relationship with Urker, to whom she previously had been engaged. The couple had broken off their engagement in 2019, before Blanchard went on to marry Anderson in 2022 while she was still in prison. She filed for divorce from Anderson in April. On June 3, Urker moved to Louisiana from Texas to be closer to her. Now, Blanchard, who suffered years of abuse at the hands of her mother Dee Dee, is also sharing her dreams of being a \"good mother\" for her future child. \"All the things that I wanted in a mother, I want to give to this baby,\" an emotional Blanchard says in her YouTube announcement. She adds, \"I am a mother now, I am happy, and I just want to be a good mother for my child. I want to be everything my mother wasn't.\" Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

                    "title": "Opening statements to give roadmap to involuntary manslaughter case against Alec Baldwin",
                    "text": "A jury is set to hear opening statements Wednesday at the involuntary manslaughter trial of Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer, a trial that will delve into the confluence of gun safety, high-wattage celebrity and a low-budget Western movie on a remote ranch set. Prosecutors and defense attorneys selected 16 jurors — 11 women and five men — on Tuesday, seating a jury from a region with strong currents of gun ownership and safety informed by backcountry hunting. Four of the jurors will be deemed alternates while the other 12 deliberate once they get the case. The shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, a 42-year-old rising star in her craft, nearly three years ago sent shock waves through the film industry and led to one felony charge against Baldwin that could result in up to 18 months in prison. Baldwin has pleaded not guilty as he returns to the desert Southwest for the trial at a downtown courthouse in Santa Fe, a short drive from the movie-ranch setting of scenes from “Rust.\" Baldwin has claimed the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware that it was loaded with a live round, he said he pulled back the hammer — not the trigger — and it fired. Prosecutors say they'll present evidence that Baldwin went “off script” and failed to follow basic industry standards for firearms safety when he pointed the firearm at Hutchins on Oct. 21, 2021. “At the end of the day, the prosecutor’s main theory is that this was a gun involved, and Baldwin had a gun in his hand, and it doesn’t matter if it’s a film set or hunting safety class, you’re responsible for what comes out of the end of the barrel,” said John Day, a Santa Fe-based defense attorney and former prosecutor. Baldwin attorney Alex Spiro probed prospective jurors on Tuesday for strong opinions about gun safety and asked whether a person must entirely take responsibility for whether a gun is loaded or may “rely on experts, does anybody have a problem with that?” Most who answered said they always treat a gun as if it were loaded. Baldwin, the star of “Beetlejuice,” “Glengarry Glen Ross” and “30 Rock” who has been a household name as an actor and public personality for more than three decades, also served as co-producer on “Rust,” which had an initial budget of roughly $7.5 million — a low figure by labor union standards. Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer ruled shortly before trial that his producer status is not relevant to the case. Workplace safety investigators and prior court testimony confirmed two gun misfires on set before the fatal shooting, while six crew members walked off set on the eve of Hutchins' death over concerns including hotel accommodations and safety. Marlowe Sommer put a summary of those findings off-limits at the request of prosecutors, who describe that investigation as unreliable. In court filings, defense attorneys have highlighted that the armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, already has been found responsible for the shooting, along with testimony that the gun had been checked by an assistant director before it was handed to Baldwin — and that the shooting was incomprehensible and shocking to the entire movie crew because of their belief that there was no live ammunition on set. Gutierrez-Reed is serving an 18-month prison sentence as she appeals her conviction in March on a charge of involuntary manslaughter. Prosecutors cast blame on her for allowing live rounds to make their way onto the film set undetected, in a trial that also highlighted video of Baldwin rushing weapons supervisors to reload his revolver and waving the gun as a pointing stick. Prosecutors have two alternative standards for proving the charge. One is based on the negligent use of a firearm. The other is proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Baldwin acted with total disregard or indifference for the safety of others. Testimony at trial will delve into shortcomings in a final safety check of the gun before Baldwin began rehearsing with it, as well as the mechanics of the weapon and whether it could have fired without a trigger pull. The live bullet that killed Hutchins also wounded director Joel Souza. Day says that Baldwin's insistence that he never pulled the trigger, first voiced in a December 2021 interview with ABC News, narrows the options for the defense at trial. “Because he said that to George Stephanopoulos, the defense has got to try to show that, well, the gun will just go off if you look at it funny,\" Day said. “They've also got to bring in experts on the film business who can say, ‘You know, if somebody hands an actor a gun and tells him it’s safe, then he should believe them.'” Los Angeles-based civil defense attorney Mark Sedlander said it's unusual for an accidental workplace death to reach criminal trial but that the fatal shooting on “Rust” touches on fundamental safety concerns in the workplace. “This is a case about a woman who was tragically killed while she was at work, away from her family, doing her job, just like Americans across this country, and she went to work one day and she never came back,” said Sedlander of the Mancini Shenk law firm. Prosecutors initially dismissed an involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin in April 2023, saying they were informed the gun might have been modified before the shooting and malfunctioned. A more recent analysis of the gun commissioned by prosecutors concluded the “trigger had to be pulled or depressed sufficiently to release the fully cocked or retracted hammer.\" Defense attorneys contend that destructive testing of the gun by the FBI that broke pieces of the firing mechanism may have destroyed evidence that could possibly exonerate Baldwin. ___ Dalton reported from Los Angeles.",

                    "text": "July 10 (UPI) -- The first full day of actor Alec Baldwin's involuntary manslaughter trial got underway Wednesday in New Mexico with opening statements as the first witnesses took the stand. Judge Mary Marlow Sommer first opened the trial Wednesday morning in Santa Fe by reading Baldwin's grand jury indictment and with instructions to the jury, which got selected Tuesday the day before. \"The trial is expected to last eight days,\" the judge told jurors. Along with the actor's wife, Hilaria, also in the New Mexico court house to support his brother was fellow actor Stephen Baldwin. \"When someone plays make believe with a real gun in a real-life workplace and while playing make believe with that gun, violates the cardinal rules of firearm safety, peoples' lives are endangered, and someone could be killed,\" Special Prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson said in her opening statement. \"Ladies and gentlemen, that's what this case is about. It's simple. It's straightforward.\" If convicted, Baldwin faces up to 18 months in prison. Johnson told the jury Baldwin allegedly asked to be given the \"biggest gun\" available. The gun, she told jurors, was sold to the film crew in \"perfect\" working order, and that Baldwin routinely failed to do safety checks and, likewise, failed to do so the day Halyna Hutchins was fatally shot in 2021 on the \"Rust\" set. \"He pointed the gun at another human being, cocked the hammer and pulled that trigger, in reckless disregard for Ms. Hutchins' safety,\" Johnson said. \"The only true and just verdict in this case, so that true justice can be served, is a verdict of guilty to involuntary manslaughter.\" Baldwin, who was both acting in and producing the movie, faces charges stemming from the incident in which he was rehearsing a scene with a revolver when the gun discharged a live bullet, killing Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. \"You will learn that one of the rounds in that revolver was a real round, and the evidence will show that Ms. Gutierrez then handed the gun to the defendant,\" Johnson said. \"And what you will learn is that, once again, the defendant failed to do a gun safety check with this armorer.\" He was practicing what's known as a cross-draw in a church on the movie set in Santa Fe, N.M., when the gun fired a live round, striking Hutchins, who died, and Souza, who sustained a non-life-threatening injury. The gun in question was supposed to have been loaded with blanks, but a live round was in the gun. Baldwin has maintained that he did not pull the trigger when the gun went off and denied responsibility for Hutchins' death on the grounds that there were supposed to be no live rounds on set, while prosecutors argue Baldwin disregarded the risks by declining to participate in the armorer's safety check and that he handled the gun in a way that the rehearsal did not require. \"You'll see the video footage of the multiple occasions during which the defendant used this firearm on the set, and each time he fired it, it was working just fine,\" the prosecution told the jury. \"And in fact, you'll hear evidence that the defendant himself admitted in December of 2021 that this gun didn't have any mechanical problems.\" An independent report last year insisted it was nearly impossible for the weapon to fire without the trigger being pulled. That report hinted that Baldwin possibly could again face manslaughter charges. Meanwhile, Baldwin's defense tried to shift the focus as to how a live bullet got into the gun in the first place when it was not supposed to be there, saying Baldwin committed no crime. \"This was an unspeakable tragedy, but Alec Baldwin committed no crime,\" Alex Spiro, a Baldwin defense attorney, said. \"He was an actor, acting. Playing the role of Harland Rust. An actor playing a character can act in ways that are lethal, that just aren't lethal on a movie set.\" Spiro placed blame on the armorer and David Halls, the first assistant director of \"Rust\" at the time, who admitted that he was \"negligent\" by failing to check safety measures as Baldwin's defense the actor could not have been responsible for Hutchins' death, as actors are expected to rely on professionals to ensure the safe handling of weapons on set. \"Everybody on a movie set has a role,\" Spiro told the court Wednesday. \"The armorer armors. The director directs. The actor acts. They work in harmony, but they have a division of responsibility.\" Spiro played a 911 call by the set's script supervisor that yelling expletives that appeared to directly blame Halls for the mishap. He pointed out how on a movie set, \"you're allowed to pull the trigger,\" but that even if Baldwin did intentionally pull the trigger as he claims he did not, \"that doesn't make him guilty of homicide.\" \"He did not know, or have any reason to know, that gun was loaded with a live bullet,\" Spiro told the jury. But experts say Baldwin has essentially no responsibility for Hutchins' 2021 shooting death on the set where Baldwin was also a producer. \"If I'm out in the street and someone hands me a gun and I shoot it and injure someone, I'm negligent, but not so on a movie set where my only job is to act,\" entertainment attorney Tre Lovell told USA TODAY. This arrives as it was recently announced the 66-year-old actor and his wife, Hilaria, 40, landed their own TLC reality show, The Baldwins, expected to premiere next year as the trial would have likely been over for several months by that point. The TLC announcement followed the news how the judge presiding over the involuntary manslaughter case had denied Baldwin's request to dismiss the charge.",

                    "text": "SANTA FE, N.M. — A jury is set to hear opening statements Wednesday at the involuntary manslaughter trial of Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer, a trial that will delve into the confluence of gun safety, high-wattage celebrity and a low-budget Western movie on a remote ranch set. Prosecutors and defense attorneys selected 16 jurors – 11 women and five men – on Tuesday, seating a jury from a region with strong currents of gun ownership and safety informed by backcountry hunting. Four of the jurors will be deemed alternates while the other 12 deliberate once they get the case. The shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, a 42-year-old rising star in her craft, nearly three years ago sent shock waves through the film industry and led to one felony charge against Baldwin that could result in up to 18 months in prison. Baldwin has pleaded not guilty as he returns to the desert Southwest for the trial at a downtown courthouse in Santa Fe, a short drive from the movie-ranch setting of scenes from “Rust.” Baldwin has claimed the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware that it was loaded with a live round, he said he pulled back the hammer – not the trigger – and it fired. Prosecutors say they’ll present evidence that Baldwin went “off script” and failed to follow basic industry standards for firearms safety when he pointed the firearm at Hutchins on Oct. 21, 2021. “At the end of the day, the prosecutor’s main theory is that this was a gun involved, and Baldwin had a gun in his hand, and it doesn’t matter if it’s a film set or hunting safety class, you’re responsible for what comes out of the end of the barrel,” said John Day, a Santa Fe-based defense attorney and former prosecutor. Baldwin attorney Alex Spiro probed prospective jurors on Tuesday for strong opinions about gun safety and asked whether a person must entirely take responsibility for whether a gun is loaded or may “rely on experts, does anybody have a problem with that?” Most who answered said they always treat a gun as if it were loaded. Baldwin, the star of “Beetlejuice,” “Glengarry Glen Ross” and “30 Rock” who has been a household name as an actor and public personality for more than three decades, also served as co-producer on “Rust,” which had an initial budget of roughly $7.5 million – a low figure by labor union standards. Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer ruled shortly before the trial that his producer status was not relevant to the case. Workplace safety investigators and prior court testimony confirmed two gun misfires on set before the fatal shooting, while six crew members walked off set on the eve of Hutchins’ death over concerns including hotel accommodations and safety. Marlowe Sommer put a summary of those findings off-limits at the request of prosecutors, who described that investigation as unreliable. In court filings, defense attorneys have highlighted that the armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, already has been found responsible for the shooting, along with testimony that the gun had been checked by an assistant director before it was handed to Baldwin – and that the shooting was incomprehensible and shocking to the entire movie crew because of their belief that there was no live ammunition on set. Gutierrez-Reed is serving an 18-month prison sentence as she appeals her conviction in March on a charge of involuntary manslaughter. Prosecutors cast blame on her for allowing live rounds to make their way onto the film set undetected, in a trial that also highlighted a video of Baldwin rushing weapons supervisors to reload his revolver and waving the gun as a pointing stick. Prosecutors have two alternative standards for proving the charge. One is based on the negligent use of a firearm. The other is proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Baldwin acted with total disregard or indifference for the safety of others. Testimony at trial will delve into shortcomings in a final safety check of the gun before Baldwin began rehearsing with it, as well as the mechanics of the weapon and whether it could have fired without a trigger pull. The live bullet that killed Hutchins also wounded director Joel Souza. Day says that Baldwin’s insistence that he never pulled the trigger, first voiced in a December 2021 interview with ABC News, narrows the options for the defense at trial. “Because he said that to George Stephanopoulos, the defense has got to try to show that, well, the gun will just go off if you look at it funny,” Day said. “They’ve also got to bring in experts on the film business who can say, ‘You know, if somebody hands an actor a gun and tells him it’s safe, then he should believe them.’” Los Angeles-based civil defense attorney Mark Sedlander said it’s unusual for an accidental workplace death to reach criminal trial but that the fatal shooting on “Rust” touches on fundamental safety concerns in the workplace. “This is a case about a woman who was tragically killed while she was at work, away from her family, doing her job, just like Americans across this country, and she went to work one day and she never came back,” said Sedlander of the Mancini Shenk law firm. Prosecutors initially dismissed an involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin in April 2023, saying they were informed the gun might have been modified before the shooting and malfunctioned. A more recent analysis of the gun commissioned by prosecutors concluded the “trigger had to be pulled or depressed sufficiently to release the fully cocked or retracted hammer.” Defense attorneys contend that destructive testing of the gun by the FBI that broke pieces of the firing mechanism may have destroyed evidence that could possibly exonerate Baldwin.

                    "text": "SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A defense attorney told jurors Wednesday that the shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was an “unspeakable tragedy” but that “ Alec Baldwin committed no crime; he was an actor, acting.” Baldwin’s lawyer Alex Spiro emphasized in his opening statement in a Santa Fe, New Mexico, courtroom that Baldwin, who is on trial for involuntary manslaughter, did exactly what actors always do on the set of the film “Rust,” where Hutchins was killed in October, 2021. “I don’t have to tell you any more about this, because you’ve all seen gunfights in movies,” Spiro said. Special prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson said in her opening statement that before the shooting, Baldwin skipped safety checks and recklessly handled a revolver. “The evidence will show that someone who played make believe with a real gun and violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety is the defendant, Alexander Baldwin,” Ocampo Johnson said. Spiro replied that “these cardinal rules, they’re not cardinal rules on a movie set.” “On a movie set, safety has to occur before a gun is placed in an actor’s hand,” Spiro told the jury. The first witness to take the stand was the first law enforcement officer to arrive at Bonanza Creek Ranch after the shooting. Video shown in the courtroom from the body camera of Nicholas LeFleur, then a Santa Fe county sheriff’s deputy, captured the frantic efforts to save Hutchins, who looked unconscious as several people attended to her and gave her an oxygen mask. In the courtroom, Baldwin looked at the screen somberly as it played. Later in the video, LeFleur can be seen telling Baldwin not to speak to the other potential witnesses, but Baldwin repeatedly does. When special prosecutor Kari Morrissey asked whether the sheriff’s deputy handled the situation ideally he responded, “Probably not. But it’s what happened.” Spiro pressed LeFleur on why he left the word “accidental” out of his description of the shooting call during his questioning by the prosecution. LeFleur said it was not intentional. And LeFleur acknowledged that in a pretrial interview he said the circumstances of the scene suggested that Baldwin’s actions were unintentional. Ocampo Johnson in her opening walked the jurors through the events leading up to Hutchins death. She said on that day, Baldwin declined multiple opportunities for standard safety checks with armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed before the rehearsal in the small church about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the courthouse where Hutchins, “a vibrant 42-year-old rising star,” was killed. She said Baldwin instead “did his own thing.” “He cocks the hammer, points it straight at Miss Hutchins, and fires that gun, sending that live bullet right into Miss Hutchins body,” said Ocampo Johnson, a relative newcomer to the case, appointed in late April by the Santa Fe district attorney’s office. During the presentation, Baldwin trained his eyes downward on a notepad, away from the jury. He watched Spiro intently during his opening. His wife Hilaria Baldwin, younger brother Stephen Baldwin and older sister Elizabeth Keuchler — who wiped away tears at times — were among the family and friends sitting behind him. The 16 jurors — 11 women and five men — come from a region with strong currents of gun ownership and safety informed by backcountry hunting. Four of the jurors will be deemed alternates while the other 12 deliberate once they get the case. Hutchins’ death and the wounding of director Joel Souza nearly three years ago sent shock waves through the film industry and led to one felony charge against Baldwin, 66, that could result in up to 18 months in prison. “It killed an amazing person,” Spiro said. “It wounded another, and it changed lives forever.” Baldwin has claimed the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware that it was loaded with a live round, he said he pulled back the hammer — not the trigger — and it fired. “No one saw him intentionally pull the trigger,” Spiro said. But he said even if Baldwin had pulled it and was lying, Spiro said, it still would not have been manslaughter. “On a movie set, you’re allowed to pull that trigger,” Spiro said, adding, “that doesn’t make it a homicide.” The lawyer emphasized that the responsibility for safety lay with the film’s armorer, Gutierrez-Reed, who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and assistant director David Halls, who pleaded no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon in exchange for his testimony at trial. Baldwin had been told “cold gun” before getting the revolver, not knowing there was a live round in it. “It had been checked and double checked by those responsible for ensuring the gun was safe,” Spiro said. “He did not tamper with it he did not load it himself. He did not leave it unattended.” Spiro has in recent years become one of the most sought-after defense attorneys in the country. His clients have included Elon Musk, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, and Megan Thee Stallion. Baldwin — the star of “Beetlejuice,” “Glengarry Glen Ross” and “30 Rock” — has been a household name as an actor and public personality for more than three decades. Spiro said in concluding his opening that witnesses will attest that “no actor in history” has “intercepted a live bullet from a prop gun.” “No one could have imagined or expected an actor to do that,” the lawyer said. Testimony at trial will delve into the mechanics of the weapon and whether it could have fired without a trigger pull. Prosecutors say it couldn’t have. “That gun the defendant had asked to be assigned worked perfectly fine as it was designed,” Ocampo Johnson said. Attorney Gloria Allred sat in the front row of the courtroom audience, a reminder of Baldwin’s other legal difficulties. Allred is representing “Rust” script supervisor Mamie Mitchell and Hutchins’ sister and parents in a civil lawsuit against Baldwin and other producers. Allred said that from her observations in court, the jury appeared to be riveted by testimony and evidence including the police lapel camera video. (Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

                    "text": "Alec Baldwin heads to court Tuesday as his involuntary manslaughter trial is set to begin. The \"Rust\" star will appear for the first time in a courtroom after waiving his pre-trial appearances. He faces two counts of involuntary manslaughter. If convicted, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer could sentence the 66-year-old actor to prison for up to 18 months. Baldwin's legal team fought hard to have the charge dismissed before the July 9 start date, but Sommer denied all three motions to dismiss the case. Alex Spiro and Luke Nikas gave a handful of legal reasons why the case should be dropped, including a prejudiced grand jury, failure to allege a criminal offense and destruction of evidence. However, Sommer rejected each argument in a series of hearings. ALEC BALDWIN 'RUST' SHOOTING TRIAL LIVE UPDATES Here is a timeline of the fatal shooting aftermath that landed Baldwin in court: October 2021 - Halyna Hutchins is shot and killed on ‘Rust’ set Filming began for the \"Rust\" movie in October 2021. The Western film, which was shot on Bonanza Creek Ranch in New Mexico, had a small cast and crew. Due to safety concerns and long hours, the camera crew walked off set on Oct. 20. ALEC BALDWIN'S ‘RUST’ ARMORER REQUESTS PRISON RELEASE DAYS BEFORE ACTOR'S INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER TRIAL The next day, a gun Baldwin had been holding discharged – killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Right before the shooting, Baldwin had been handed the gun by the assistant director. Dave Halls and armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed had both allegedly claimed the gun was a \"cold,\" meaning there was no live ammo. December 2021 - Alec Baldwin sits down for first interview since fatal shooting Baldwin sat down for an interview regarding the fatal shooting in December 2021, two months after Hutchins' death. The actor described the moment the gun was discharged during the interview. \"I let go of the hammer of the gun,\" Baldwin told ABC's George Stephanopoulos. \"And the gun goes off.\" \"I didn't pull the trigger,\" Baldwin reiterated. \"The gun was supposed to be empty,\" he said. Baldwin and Hutchins had been setting up for a shot where the actor was supposed to draw the gun and point it at the camera. While standing next to the camera, the cinematographer was \"guiding\" Baldwin on where to point the gun, he said. \"The gun wasn't meant to be fired in that angle,\" he confirmed.

And the gun went off. And she just went right on the ground.\" Authorities would spend over a year investigating before bringing any charges against the \"Rust\" cast and crew.

In New Mexico, no one is above the law, and justice will be served.\" Fifteen months after the fatal shooting on the set of \"Rust,\" Baldwin was hit with two counts of involuntary manslaughter. Baldwin, along with the film's armorer, were formally charged on Jan. 31, 2023. \"Today we have taken another important step in securing justice for Halyna Hutchins,\" District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said in a statement at the time. \"In New Mexico, no one is above the law, and justice will be served.\" Baldwin's preliminary hearing was set for May. Carmack-Altwies stepped down from the case shortly after, in March 2023. \"[Kari] Morrissey's and [Jason] Lewis' extensive experience and trial expertise will allow the state to pursue justice for Halyna Hutchins and ensure that in New Mexico everyone is held accountable under the law,\" Heather Brewer, spokesperson, First New Mexico Judicial District Attorney, said in a statement.

Kari Morrissey and Jason Lewis were weeks away from having to show a judge there was enough evidence for a reasonable person to convict Baldwin at a preliminary hearing expected to last two weeks. ALEC BALDWIN'S CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR FATAL ‘RUST’ SHOOTING TO BE DROPPED: LAWYERS The prosecution made it clear that Baldwin could still face charges and \"new facts\" required further investigation.

A grand jury indicted the actor on two counts of involuntary manslaughter on Jan. 19, over two years after the fatal shooting. The move came nearly nine months after the canceled preliminary hearing. \"We look forward to our day in court,\" Spiro and Nikas told Fox News Digital at the time. Baldwin was charged with two counts – involuntary manslaughter, negligent use of a firearm, or, in the alternative, involuntary manslaughter without due caution or circumspection. \"We look forward to our day in court.\" February 2024 - Hannah Gutierrez Reed heads to court Gutierrez Reed's involuntary manslaughter trial began on Feb. 21. The jury saw testimony from weapons experts, FBI and Santa Fe County authorities, and crew members who witnessed the fatal shooting during the nearly two-week-long trial. The prosecution largely focused on Gutierrez Reed's behavior as an armorer, alleging she did not do her job correctly. \"Hannah Gutierrez knew that Baldwin was loose. She knew it,\" Morrissey said during closing arguments. \"She didn't do anything about it, even though it was her job. It was her job. It is her job to say to an A-list actor, if, in fact, that's what you want to call him, 'Hey, you can't behave that way with those firearms.' That is her job. That is what they pay her for. That is the job that she applied for. That is the job that she accepted.\" Gutierrez Reed's legal team had told the jury that the prosecution had not presented enough evidence to convict the armorer of involuntary manslaughter.

A fatal gunshot done with your recklessness in the face of knowledge that your acts were reasonably likely to result in serious harm.\" \"You were the armorer, the one that's to be between a safe weapon and a weapon that could kill someone.

                    "text": "Alec Baldwin's criminal trial in the fatal \"Rust\" shooting hinges on a single question: Was it the Hollywood actor's responsibility to do a safety check on his gun? Baldwin's trial on involuntary manslaughter charges in the 2021 death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins began Wednesday with a prosecutor telling jurors that Baldwin acted negligently because he never bothered to check his gun and frequently went off script during production of the low-budget western near Santa Fe. Then, during the ill-fated rehearsal on Oct. 21, 2021, Baldwin unexpectedly cocked the hammer of his prop gun and pulled the trigger in a reckless act that caused Hutchins' death, special prosecutor Erlinda O. Johnson alleged. One of Baldwin's attorneys provided jurors with a dramatically different account. The real problem was not that Baldwin was manipulating his gun; that's what actors do, Baldwin attorney Alex Spiro said. During his opening statement, Spiro suggested the real crime was that a live bullet had found its way on the New Mexico movie set. The film's safety officer and weapons expert were the ones who failed to perform their duties, as did sheriff's deputies who were unable to figure out the source of the live ammunition, Spiro said. \"They didn't find the lethal bullet — they never did,\" Spiro said. “Looking for that shiny object, they found another shiny object. Instead of trying to find the source of the lethal bullet, they focused on Mr. Baldwin.\" Spiro suggested that sheriff's deputies and prosecutors were under considerable pressure because \"the media was swirling.\" Even though investigators long considered the shooting an accident, state officials started scrutinizing Baldwin's conduct despite knowing he did not bring the bullets onto the set, Spiro said. Spiro stressed that it was the film's assistant director and the armorer — not the actor — who were tasked with checking the guns. Baldwin's role was to realistically portray his character, the outlaw Harland Rust, Spiro said. \"He is deeply focused in that moment on his character,\" Spiro said. \"He was just acting as he has done for decades. It was the safety experts who let them all down. Alec Baldwin had committed no crime.\" Baldwin was indicted in January on one count of involuntary manslaughter. He has pleaded not guilty. His trial is expected to last eight days. If convicted, he could spend up to 18 months in prison. “On a movie set, you are allowed to pull the trigger,\" Spiro said, adding that Baldwin \"did not know or have any reason to believe that gun was loaded with a live bullet.” After Spiro finished his opening statement and sat beside Baldwin, the actor put both arms around Spiro and leaned in to whisper something. The 66-year-old actor-producer arrived at the Santa Fe County courthouse at 8 a.m. with his wife, Hilaria. Baldwin stopped to hug his sister, Elizabeth Keuchler, who arrived for the first day of the trial. She sat next to their brother, Stephen Baldwin, who was flanked by Hilaria Baldwin in the second row of the courtroom, behind the defense table. Famed victims' rights attorney Gloria Allred sat in the first row behind the prosecutors. Allred represents Hutchins' family members who live in Ukraine as well as \"Rust\" script supervisor Mamie Mitchell. The family members and Mitchell have brought negligence lawsuits against Baldwin and the other producers. The producers deny any wrongdoing. The film’s director, Joel Souza, who was injured in the shooting but recovered, is expected to testify. “The director will tell you that many times the actor would do his own thing,” Johnson, the prosecutor, said. She also noted that members of the camera crew had walked off the \"Rust\" set — hours before the tragic accident. \"They were concerned over safety breaches,\" Johnson said. The 2021 shooting shined a harsh light on New Mexico's vibrant film community. \"We are not a wealthy state and we work hard to bring industry here, and one area that is really starting to thrive is the movie industry,\" Santa Fe resident Gail Anderson said Tuesday evening. The \"Rust\" shooting \"revealed how film sets are managed and how they need to be more tightly managed,\" Anderson said. More than 100 reporters and TV camera operators clustered around the courthouse in downtown Santa Fe on Wednesday. The trial is being livestreamed by Court TV and the Law&Crime network. Grand jurors in January determined there was sufficient evidence to charge Baldwin for allegedly acting negligently by pointing a loaded gun at Hutchins without first checking the weapon for ammunition. In March, a different jury found the armorer Hannah Gutierrez guilty of involuntary manslaughter. The judge sentenced her to 18 months in prison. Assistant director David Halls last year pleaded no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon. He received a suspended sentence of six months of probation, which he completed last fall. Now it's up to the jury to determine whether Baldwin is also culpable. \"I'm not a friend of Alec Baldwin, but that man would never intentionally shoot someone on a set,\" Anderson, the Santa Fe resident, said. \"It's just a horrible tragedy.\"",

The name and number that could seen on the back of jerseys worn throughout the hot concrete streets of New York City in the buildup to this Copa America semifinal pitting Argentina against Canada. It was mostly on display on the back of Argentina jerseys, but there was the occasional Inter Miami shirt to be found, perhaps more than might be expected, and evidence of his impact on the Major League Soccer franchise. Those hoping to glimpse Lionel Messi in action were not disappointed. Lautaro Martínez went into this game as the tournament’s top scorer, and its most productive striker, but had to settle for a place on the bench as coach Lionel Scaloni chose Julián Álavarez to partner Messi in attack from the start. What made this game even more intriguing was that Canada has had something about it in this tournament. It has had to to get this far, knocking out an impressive Venezuela in the quarterfinals, and generally troubling opposition sides with their counter-attacking and counter-pressing. They were also the one remaining Concacaf nation of the six invited to this Conmebol tournament. Canada showed from the off that it might trouble Argentina. Jacob Shaffleburg had a couple of early sights at goal, managing to get relatively free down the left-hand side.

The more threatening attacking play certainly came from the team in red in the opening 20 minutes. But it was Argentina who grabbed the opening goal, swiftly and almost out of nowhere. The quality of the chance was mostly down to the weight and direction of Álvarez’s first touch. Rodrigo De Paul’s direct through-pass from midfield seemed to be heading to Ávarez’s left, but his sticky touch took it to his right and away from Canada defender Moïse Bombito. It was then slotted past Maxime Crepeau. EAST RUTHERFORD, NEW JERSEY - JULY 09: Julian Alvarez of Argentina is challenged by can1during the ...

(Photo by Elsa/Getty Images) Getty Images Messi looked like he had decided this would be the game in which to score his first goal of the tournament. He drifted a shot wide early on and later turned Alistair Johnston inside out before shooting right-footed just wide of the near post. Jonathan David tested Emiliano Martinez’s concentration from close range at the near post just before halftime from a Johnston throw but Canada still lacked the ability to create a clear-cut chance. There seemed to be some confusion when Messi's goal eventually came. Many in attendance, even those of an Argentinian persuasion seemed to merely acknowledge the goal rather than celebrate it. The stadium camera still picking out members of the crowd rather than having returned to the action on the field to show the goal probably contributed to the muted reaction. Messi turned the ball in the net, diverting Enzo Fernández’s shot, and any subsequent questions asked about the goal deemed it fine. It turned out Derek Cornelius played Messi onside when the shot was hit by Fernández. NEW YORK, US - JUNE 25: Argentinian football fans gather in Times Square on June 25, 2024 after ...

Canada was an awkward opponent but didn’t have the quality in the final third. Even when substitute Tani Oluwaseyi had the best of Canada’s chances late on, he couldn’t find the net. Argentina, on the other hand, is not the World Cup winner and defending Copa America champion by accident. It has quality all across the pitch and has one of the greatest of all time in its ranks still performing at a high level even at 37. An official attendance of 80,102 was announced, and the majority, wearing Messi, 10, on their backs, will have left happy, having not only witnessed their idol in action but having also seen him score the goal which confirmed their progress to another final.

                    "text": "By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Lionel Messi scored his 109th international goal and first of the tournament, leading defending champion Argentina over Canada, 2-0, on Tuesday night and into the Copa America final. Julián Álvarez put the Albiceleste ahead in the 22nd minute and Messi redirected Enzo Fernández’s shot in off the face of goalkeeper Maxime Crépeau in the 51st. Messi has 28 goals in his last 25 matches for Argentina and 14 in Copa America play, three shy of the record. Only Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo with 130 has more international goals than Messi, who turned 37 on June 24. Iran’s Al Daei had 108 or 109 from 1993 to 2006, with a lingering dispute over whether a goal against Ecuador in 2000 occurred in a full international match. With a victory on its independence day, Argentina extended its unbeaten streak to 10 games. The Albiceleste will be playing for a record 16th Copa title when they square off with Uruguay or Colombia on Sunday in Miami Gardens, Florida. Trying to string together championships in consecutive Copa Americas around the 2022 World Cup championship, Argentina is trying to match the feat of Spain when La Roja won the 2008 and 2012 European Championships along with the 2010 World Cup. Argentina fans gathered in Times Square on the eve of the match and filled the streets on Manhattan before heading to MetLife Stadium, site of the 2026 World Cup final. The crowd of 80,102 on a night with an 82-degree temperature and 82% humidity was overwhelmingly pro-Argentina, with only a few sections dominated by red-clad Canadian supporters. It was among the biggest games for Canadian soccer, which went 0-6 in its only World Cup appearances in 1986 and 2022 and won its only major title at the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Argentina had beaten Canada, 2-0, in the tournament opener on June 20. Canada star Alphonso Davies limped off after his right leg was caught in a clean challenge with Gonzalo Montiel and he was replaced in the 71st minute. Making his 38th Copa America appearance, Messi had missed Argentina’s group stage finale with a leg injury and was subdued while playing 90 minutes in the quarterfinal win over Ecuador. He was just wide from the top of the penalty area in the 12th minute after exchanging passes with Ángel Di María, then wide again in the 44th and put a chip over the crossbar in first-half injury time. MetLife’s temporary grass surface appeared heavy, with water splashing and sand popping up during dribbles. Argentina went ahead after Rodrigo De Paul from the center circle played a long pass to Álvarez, who took a touch at the top of the arc to control the ball from Moïse Bombito. Álvarez took another touch to create space from Bombito and from near the penalty spot slipped the ball between the legs of Crépeau for his ninth goal in 35 international appearances. Messi scored following a throw-in. He centered the ball to De Paul, who ran to the end line and cut the ball back. Koné’s attempted clearance went to Fernández, who teed up a shot that Messi redirected from just inside the 6-yard box. Jonathan David was thwarted by Emiliano Martínez from close range in first-half stoppage time, and Martínez made a kick save on Tani Oluwaseyi in the 80th. More to come on this story.",

Only Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo with 130 has more international goals than Messi, who turned 37 on June 24. Iran’s Al Daei had 108 or 109 from 1993 to 2006, with a lingering dispute over whether a goal against Ecuador in 2000 occurred in a full international match. With a victory on its independence day, Argentina extended its unbeaten streak to 10 games. The Albiceleste seek a record 16th Copa title when they play Uruguay or Colombia on Sunday at Miami Gardens, Florida. Trying to string together championships in consecutive Copa Americas around the 2022 World Cup championship, Argentina is trying to match the feat of Spain when La Roja won the 2008 and 2012 European Championships along with the 2010 World Cup. “It’s insane what this team has done, what the Argentina national team is doing,” Messi said. “For those who remain from the old guard, it’s beyond impressive that the national team is in another final.” Argentina fans gathered in Times Square on the eve of the match and filled the streets on Manhattan before heading to MetLife Stadium, site of the 2026 World Cup final. The crowd of 80,102 on a night with an 82-degree temperature and 82% humidity was overwhelmingly pro-Argentina, with only a few sections dominated by red-clad Canadian supporters. It was among the biggest games for Canadian soccer, which went 0-6 in its only World Cup appearances in 1986 and 2022 and won its only major title at the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Argentina had beaten Canada 2-0 in the tournament opener on June 20. Canada star Alphonso Davies limped off after his right leg was caught in a clean challenge with Gonzalo Montiel and he was replaced in the 71st minute. Making his 38th Copa America appearance, Messi had missed Argentina’s group stage finale with a leg injury and was subdued while playing 90 minutes in the quarterfinal win over Ecuador. He was just wide from the top of the penalty area in the 12th minute after exchanging passes with Ángel Di María, then wide again in the 44th and put a chip over the crossbar in first-half injury time. MetLife’s temporary grass surface appeared heavy, with water splashing and sand popping up during dribbles. “It’s has been a very difficult Copa América, very competitive, bad surfaces, excessive heat,” Messi said. Argentina went ahead after Rodrigo De Paul from the center circle played a long pass to Álvarez, who took a touch at the top of the arc to control the ball from Moïse Bombito. Álvarez took another touch to create space from Bombito and from near the penalty spot slipped the ball between the legs of Crépeau for his ninth goal in 35 international appearances. Messi scored following a throw-in. He centered the ball to De Paul, who ran to the end line and cut the ball back. Koné’s attempted clearance went to Fernández, who teed up a shot that Messi redirected from just inside the 6-yard box. “I just put myself in the middle of it,” Messi said. “I wasn’t sure if Enzo’s ball was going to get in. It was a reflex.” Jonathan David was thwarted by Emiliano Martínez from close range in first-half stoppage time, and Martínez made a kick save on Tani Oluwaseyi in the 80th. ___ AP Copa America coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/copa-america",

                    "text": "This type of reaction is reserved for the all-time greats. Only the most famed legends can elicit a reception of this magnitude. A raucous, sellout crowd at MetLife Stadium nearly all celebrated at once when Lionel Messi scored in the 51st minute Tuesday night, giving Argentina a 2-0 lead during their win over Canada by the same score in the 2024 Copa America semifinal. Argentina will face the winner of Wednesday’s Uruguay-Colombia match in the other semifinal. With the softest of touches, Messi deflected a shot from Enzo Fernandez past Canadian goalie Maxime Crepeau and gave fans the near-religious experience they had been waiting for. Limbs began wildly moving all across the stadium, and perhaps soccer’s best player ever became the center of adoration. It was Messi’s 109th career goal for Argentina and 14th in all Copa Americas, but it finally marked his first at this year’s edition of the tournament. If this is the 37-year-old Messi’s final chapter in Argentina’s famous blue and white stripes, he’s one step away from the perfect ending. As the whopping 80,102 fans — the vast, vast majority of whom supported Argentina — poured into MetLife Stadium, it was hard not to contrast with the venue’s normal inhabitants. When was the last time the Giants packed every seat in their stadium to the brim in such a manner? When was the last time the Jets whipped their fans into such a frenzy? Of course, as the reigning World Cup champions and FIFA’s No. 1-ranked team in the world, Messi has co-stars that make Argentina such an immense draw. Forward Julian Alvarez, who opened the scoring Tuesday night in the 22nd minute, is a budding talent that has delivered in crucial moments. Goalie Emiliano Martinez, who kept a clean sheet Tuesday, is a fan favorite who has one of the biggest personalities in all of soccer. Forward Angel Di Maria is a team icon who has been a staple in the lineup for over a decade. The list goes on. But Messi is the protagonist. Messi is the main draw. It was “Meeeeesi, Meeeeesi” that constantly rang around the stadium. It was Messi who fans stood for every time he possessed the ball. It was Messi who fans pretended to bow for when he came close to the sidelines. Rodrigo De Paul cleverly found Alvarez from midfield with a through ball, and Alvarez subsequently slotted past Crepeau to give Argentina a 1-0 lead. Canada nearly equalized when Jonathan David managed to take a shot from within the 6-yard box, but Martinez was able to save it. Martinez later in the 89th minute saved a point-blank shot from Tani Oluwaseyi to keep the score at 2-0. Messi came close in the 12th and 44th minutes, both times missing just wide of the net before his second-half goal. Now playing his club soccer in the MLS at Inter Miami, it’s clear Messi has accepted that he is in the final stage of his career. It’s unlikely that he’ll be back with Argentina when the World Cup comes, in part, to America in 2026. After an international career that was long defined by failure, Messi can end it in triumph. He lost in the World Cup final in 2014 and the Copa America final in 2015 and 2016. He briefly retired from the Argentina squad, with a major international title serving as the one missing piece of his career. But he’s since returned and restored his nation to the mantle it once sat upon. And assuming this is his last run on the international level, Messi is now 90 minutes away from leaving Argentina right there — on top.",

                    "text": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — Lionel Messi plans to keep playing for Argentina beyond Sunday’s Copa America final. “As I’ve said before, I intend to continue,” he said Tuesday night after Argentina’s 2-0 win over Canada. “I intend to keep living day by day without thinking about what will come in the future or whether I’ll continue or not. It’s something I just live each day. I’m 37 years and only God knows when the end will be.” Messi scored his 109th international goal, his first in this year’s tournament. It was his 14th in Copa America play, three shy of the record. The eight-time Ballon d’Or winner spoke outside the locker room at MetLife Stadium, where he announced his retirement after missing a penalty kick in the shootout loss to Chile in the 2016 Copa America final. He reversed his decision seven weeks later and has scored 54 goals in 73 international appearances since, raising his matches for Argentina to 186 as he helped win the 2021 Copa America and 2022 World Cup. Teammate Ángel Di María does intend to retire after Sunday’s game against Uruguay or Colombia at Miami Gardens, Florida. The 36-year-old Di María made his international debut in 2008 and has 31 goals in 144 appearances, “It’s my last battle. There’s nothing left to say that I haven’t said a lot of times before,” Di María explained. “It’s my last game. I have to say thank you to all Argentineans and to this generation that has allowed me to lift so many trophies.” Di María joined with Messi to lead Argentina to it’s third World Cup and 15th Copa America title. “We’ve enjoyed him so much,” Messi said. “He’s always given his all and the best of himself and that he will retire in a final is something he simply deserves.” Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni held out hope Di María will reverse his decision. “We don’t want to start crying right now. We don’t want to feel melancholy,” Scaloni said. “We have to let him play and then we’ll see if we can convince him or not to stay with us.” South American World Cup qualifying resumes in September, with each national team scheduled to play 12 more matches. The 2026 World Cup final will be at MetLife, that July 19. “We will never be the ones to close the door,” Scaloni said. “He can be with our team for as long as he wants to be. And if he wants to retire but still come and hang around, it would be great. And if he wants to come with me to somewhere else, I will take him everywhere so he can decide whatever he wants to do.” ___ AP Copa America coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/copa-america",

                    "text": "July 10 (UPI) -- Lionel Messi and Julian Alvarez each scored to lead top-ranked Argentina to a 2-0 shutout of No. 48 Canada, clinching a spot in the Copa America finale for the defending tournament champions. Alvarez found the net in the 22nd minute Tuesday at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. Messi added insurance with another score in the 51st minute. Midfielders Enzo Fernandez and Rodrigo De Paul assisted the forwards. Argentina will face No. 14 Uruguay or No. 12 Colombia in the Copa America finale at 8 p.m. EDT Sunday at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla. \"It's madness what this team has done, what the Argentinian national team has been doing,\" Messi said in his on-field interview. \"I think that each time we make a final, there's more importance to the finals I have left to play.\" Canada failed to capitalize on several early chances. Messi nearly scored the opening goal in the 12th minute, but that shot sailed just wide of the right post. The Argentines finally broke through midway through the first half. De Paul started the sequence, receiving a pass at midfield. He dribbled into Canada territory and sent a long ball toward the box. Alvarez knocked the pass down with a velvety-soft touch, outpaced the Canada defense and finished the play with a right-footed shot between the legs of goalie Maxime Crepeau for a 1-0 lead. Veteran winger Angel Di Maria nearly doubled the Argentine lead in the 34th minute, but that attempt flew over the crossbar. Canada's defense also held up, denying more chances in the first half, including several from Messi. Messi then doubled the lead about five minutes into the second act. The star striker dribbled deep in the right corner before passing off to De Paul inside the box. Messi then ran toward the goal, but De Paul's pass back was intercepted by Ismael Kone. The Canada midfielder attempted to clear the ball, but instead sent it directly to Fernandez. Fernandez sent the ball back toward the goal, where Messi redirected a shot off Crepeau and into the net. Crepeau and Argentine keeper Emiliano Martinez continued to deny attempts down the stretch, helping the result stand. Canada also lost star defender Alphonso Davies to an ankle injury. He left the game in the 71st minute. Uruguay will take on Colombia in the other Copa America semifinal at 8 p.m. Wednesday at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte. The matchup will air on FS1. Sunday's final will air on Fox.",

                    "text": "Rays shortstop Wander Franco has been formally charged with sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of a minor in the Dominican Republic, reports ESPN. Allegations of Franco's conduct first surfaced last August and he's been under investigation by the Dominican government since. Franco last played a game for the Rays on Aug. 12, 2023. He's been on administrative leave since and recently had the leave extended through July 14 so the league could allow the legal process to play out. Being on leave means Franco hasn't been on the Rays roster, but is continuing to be paid. He is in the third year of an 11-year, $182 million contract, but Major League Baseball can suspend Franco -- likely after the legal process has concluded -- without pay under the joint domestic violence policy. Allegations that Franco had a relationship with a 14-year-old girl came to light last August. According to prosecutors, the 23-year-old infielder provided the girl's mother with cash payments and a car in exchange for her consenting to the relationship. He was arrested in early January and released on a conditional waiver after paying the equivalent of about $34,000. Prosecutors accused Franco of \"taking the minor away from her home in Puerto Plata in December 2022 and having a four-month relationship with her with consent from the girl's mother,\" the Associated Press reported in January. In September 2023, authorities raided the home of the girl's mother and seized 800,000 Dominican pesos ($13,700) as well as $68,500 they said was found hidden behind a frame. They also found a guarantee certificate from a local bank for 2.1 million Dominican pesos ($36,000) that they said was delivered by Franco for the \"commercial and sexual exploitation\" of the girl.In addition, they seized a Suzuki Swift worth $26,600, according to the document. Authorities noted that days before the car was bought, the teenager's mother had the equivalent of $821 in her bank account. Franco made his first All-Star team last season and was one of MLB's biggest up-and-coming stars before the allegations and now the formal charges. As noted, MLB can discipline him outside of the result of the charges in the Dominican Republic.",

                    "text": "Wander Franco has been formally charged with sexual abuse and sexual exploitation against a minor in the Dominican Republic related to an alleged relationship with a 14-year-old girl, ESPN reported Tuesday night. Franco, 23, has been on administrative leave since the allegations came to light on social media last August when photos of the Rays infielder and the girl surfaced. The girl’s mother was also included in Tuesday’s indictment, according to the Associated Press. Franco is alleged to have paid the woman thousands of dollars to consent to the four-month relationship, the AP reported. He last played for the Rays on Aug. 12, and he was placed on administrative leave shortly after the disturbing accusations surfaced. Franco was placed back on administrative leave at the start of this MLB season. The formal complaint was initially filed on July 10, 2023, and prosecutors had until last Friday to press charges against Franco, but Dominican Republic law allows for a judge to grant an extra 10 days for the prosecution to present their “conclusions,” according to the AP. Franco had been summoned to speak with Dominican authorities in December but failed to show up for a face-to-face sitdown with the Specialized Prosecutor’s Office for Children and Adolescents. That prompted his arrest on Jan 1. for failing to appear, though he was released a week later. As part of the condition of his release, he was required to make mandatory check-ins in the Dominican Republic on the 30th of every month. Accusations of money laundering and commercial sexual exploitation were dismissed in January when Franco was released, and he was instead accused of sexual and psychological abuse, ESPN reported. Authorities accused Franco of “taking the minor away from her home in Puerto Plata in December 2022 and having a four-month relationship with her with consent from the girl’s mother,” the Associated Press reported in January. Franco, an American League All-Star last year, signed a franchise record 11-year, $182 million contract in 2021. MLB has continued its own investigation into Franco’s alleged relationship, but ESPN reported that it will not likely be concluded until the criminal case comes to an end.",

Franco has been under investigation since July 10, 2023, when a complaint was filed against him for allegedly having had sexual relations with a 14-year-old girl. Franco was initially accused by Dominican prosecutors of commercial sexual exploitation and money laundering on Jan. 3; the mother of the girl, who was 14 when the alleged relationship began in December 2022, faced the same charge. Six days later, after further review of the evidence, a judge in the Dominican Republic instead accused Franco of a lesser charge of sexual and psychological abuse. In a nearly 600-page document obtained by ESPN and presented to the judge at a hearing in January, prosecutors shared the evidence they have found in their investigation into Franco. The file includes transcripts of interviews with the girl and her relatives and messages between Franco and the girl. Major League Baseball and the MLB Players Association recently extended Franco's administrative leave through July 14, a procedural move to buy more time while the Dominican authorities worked on the criminal case. MLB launched a separate investigation into Franco that is not expected to be completed until after his criminal case is resolved. Franco, 23, agreed to a $182 million, 11-year extension contract in November 2021, just 70 games into his major league career.

Franco was placed on administrative leave on Aug. 22 as Major League Baseball investigated his alleged relationships with underage girls. The allegations were made public earlier that month following social media posts, but the first complaint was filed in July. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The Rays began to take down images of Franco around Tropicana Field amid the allegations. There has also been no sign of Franco merchandise being sold at the Rays' team store within their ballpark. Franco last played a Major League game on Aug. 12, and with the charges, it is now increasingly likely he will never play again. Franco was an All-Star for the first time last season. He slashed .281/.344/.475 with 17 homers and 58 RBI over 112 games this past season. He signed an 11-year, $182 million contract extension in November 2021, but a team option in 2033 could make the deal worth $233 million when it is over. Of course, the Rays could get out of it if Franco goes to jail, citing a \"good citizenship\" clause in the uniform player contract. TWINS' JOE RYAN CAUGHT IN VIRAL MOMENT AS HE POURS BABY POWDER DOWN PANTS IN GAME TO COMBAT EXTREME HEAT After Dominican police raided two homes associated with Franco just before the new year, he was eventually arrested. He was later released under the condition that he meet with local authorities once a month. According to ESPN, Dominican prosecutors say that Franco called the minor \"my girl\" in a WhatsApp message, admitting that the relationship was a \"risk,\" but he \"loved it.\" \"My girl,\" Franco allegedly wrote in Spanish. \"If my team realizes this, it could cause problems for me. It is a rule for all teams that we cannot talk to minors, and yet I took the risk and I loved it.\" Prosecutors say Franco's relationship with the girl, now 15, lasted four months, and he paid her to not speak about it. The girl's mother also faces charges for money laundering based on gifts sent to her by Franco. Franco and the girl met on Dec. 9, 2022, after he \"took her from her home,\" had sex twice in a two-day span and began their relationship. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Franco gave the girl the equivalent of $46,000 in July and August, the documents say, and paid the mother about $1,700 per month, along with a new car.

                    "text": "July 10 (UPI) -- Prosecutors formally charged Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Wander Franco with sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl in the Dominican Republic. Sources told ESPN, Listin Diario and Diario Libre that the charges -- sexual abuse and sexual exploitation against a minor -- were presented Tuesday in the Dominican province of Puerta Plata. Franco has been under investigation since last July after a complaint was issued against him for the alleged sexual relationship with the minor. Franco's U.S.-based lawyer, Jay Reisinger, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the charges. MLB, which has an open investigation into the allegations, extended Franco's administrative leave in May. That term runs through Sunday. The Rays had no comment on the formal charges filed against Franco. MLB placed the Rays infielder on administrative leave last August. He was arrested in January in Puerto Plata for failing to appear on a summons, while facing allegations of commercial sexual exploitation and money laundering. Those charges were later dismissed. The girl's mother still faces those charges after allegedly receiving thousands of dollars from Franco in exchange for her consent in the relationship between her daughter and the baseball star. Franco, who denied the allegations last year, was released on parole, but has been required to return for monthly visits with a judge. The Bani, D.R., native faces up to five years in prison if found guilty if his current charges. Franco, 23, signed an 11-year, $182 million contract extension in 2021. He still is receiving his $2.4 million salary for 2024 under the terms of MLB's administrative leave, which is not disciplinary under the league's domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy. Franco's salary is scheduled to escalate to $8.4 million in 2025, $15.4 million in 2026 and $22.4 million in 2027. He is scheduled to make at least $25 million in annual salary from 2028 through 2032, with a club option for 2033. Franco, an All-Star in 2023, was hitting .281 with 17 home runs, 58 RBIs and 30 stolen bases through 112 games when he was placed on leave last year. The Rays still went 99-63 and made the playoffs in 2023, despite their star's hiatus. They have a 44-46 record and sit in fourth place in the American League East this season, 12 games behind the division-leading Baltimore Orioles (57-34). Rays shortstop Jose Caballero hit .241 with six home runs, 24 RBIs and 24 stolen bases through his first 75 games this season. The Rays will host the New York Yankees at 6:50 p.m. EDT Wednesday in St. Petersburg, Fla.",

                    "text": "After official charges were made against Rays shortstop Wander Franco on Tuesday, his MLB status has changed. The 23-year-old is no longer on administrative leave and has been placed on the restricted list, according to multiple reports, after he was charged with sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of a minor in the Dominican Republic. ESPN’s Jeff Passan added that MLB’s investigation of Franco is still ongoing, and that further discipline from baseball’s highest office could still ensue following the end of his court case. “We are aware of the charges against Mr. Franco,” the league said in a statement. “Our investigation remains open, and we will continue to closely monitor the case as it moves forward.” On Tuesday night, ESPN Dominican Republic’s Juan Arturo Recio reported that Franco had been formally charged with sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl. Recio also indicated that Franco had been accused of human trafficking, which could warrant a 20-year prison sentence. As spring training came to a close in late March, Franco’s administrative leave was extended until June 1, The Post reported. The Rays star was initially placed on the restricted list on Aug. 14, 2023 after rumors flooded social media that Franco had been in a relationship with an underage girl. The league transferred Franco to administrative leave on Aug. 22. Dominican Republic officials swiftly initiated an investigation into Franco, including raiding properties owned by the shortstop as well as his mother in December 2023. On Jan. 1, Franco was arrested after not attending a scheduled summoning with the country’s Specialized Prosecutor’s Office for Children and Adolescents, although Franco was released from jail a week later. The 23-year-old Franco made his first All-Star appearance in 2023, with his last game played coming on Aug. 12. Franco signed an 11-year, $182 million extension with Tampa Bay in November 2021, shortly after the former top prospect had suited up in only 70 MLB games. In light of formalized charges from Dominican authorities, not to mention MLB’s continued investigation, it continues to appear unlikely that Franco will ever play professional baseball again.",

Here is more background from the Associated Press: It seems the deeper England goes at the European Championship, the less pressure its players are feeling. “You’re now into that moment of the tournament,” England coach Gareth Southgate said Tuesday, “where it’s about what’s possible and what’s achievable rather than what might go wrong.” Southgate has noticed a gradual shift in mood in his squad at Euro 2024. In theory, the stakes are higher now England has reached the semifinals and a match against the Netherlands. After all, the men’s team is within one win of getting to back-to-back European Championship finals and of reaching the title match at a major tournament for the first time outside England. Yet, Southgate said the pressure and “noise” was much higher on the players earlier in the tournament. England came to Euro 2024 with what many regarded as its strongest squad for 20 years, only to limp through the group stage, require an equalizer in the fifth minute of stoppage time begore getting past Slovakia in the last 16 and then need a penalty-shootout win over Switzerland to advance from the quarterfinals. “One of the strengths of us over the last seven, eight years has been less fear, less inhibition,” Southgate said at a pre-match news conference in Dortmund. “But I think at the beginning of the tournament, expectation weighed quite heavily and of course the external noise was louder than it has ever been. “I felt we couldn’t quite get ourselves in the right place. In the end, what was impressive was the players ground it out and found ways to win. I felt that shifted once we got to the knockout stage, definitely in the quarterfinal - we saw a better version of us with the ball. We’re freer.”",

                    "text": "England and the Netherlands meet on Wednesday in another clash of star-studded rosters that will determine who will meet Spain on Sunday in the Euro 2024 final.Both these teams survived tough quarterfinal matchups last Saturday to reach the semis. England fell behind Switzerland 1-0 in the 75th minute, but equalized in the 80th and prevailed on PKs. The Netherlands trailed Turkey 1-0 for most of their quarterfinal contest, but goals in the 70th and 76th allowed the Dutch to win 2-1 in 90 minutes.Below, we'll tackle what to expect from a betting perspective as we look to follow up on a perfect day yesterday, when all four plays cashed -- and our final score predictions were correct -- for both Spain-France and Argentina-Canada.The battle between the English and the Dutch will kick off at 3 p.m. ET on FOX from Borussia Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park.Netherlands vs. England Moneyline OddsThe three-way moneyline odds below apply to the result after 90 minutes, plus stoppage time. BetMGM FanDuel DraftKings ESPN BET bet365 Netherlands +210 +210 +215 +205 +210 Draw +180 +180 +180 +175 +180 England +165 +170 +170 +165 +170 In single-elimination tournament games like this one, sportsbooks also offer \"to advance\" odds for anyone interested in simply picking the winner (regardless of how they get it done).Netherlands vs. England Odds To Advance BetMGM FanDuel DraftKings ESPN BET bet365 Netherlands +100 +108 +105 +100 +110 England -130 -132 -130 -125 -138 Netherlands vs. England Betting AnalysisNeither of these teams enjoyed smooth sailing in group play.The Netherlands finished third in Group D with a win over Poland, a draw against France and a loss to Austria.Meanwhile, England had some well-documented struggles of their own in Group C, beating Serbia and drawing both Denmark and Slovenia.The Three Lions have continued to survive despite struggling offensively in knockout play, as they needed a last-second equalizer -- and extra time -- against Slovakia in the round of 16 and a perfect showing in PKs against Switzerland in the quarters.The Dutch enjoyed one of the most convincing victories of the entire round of 16, a 3-0 romp over Romania, before last Saturday's back-and-forth affair vs. Turkey.Can the Dutch Front Line Keep Rolling?Outside of Spain, few teams in this competition have better offensively than the Netherlands, who have scored nine goals in five matches, with at least two in all but one of their games to date.But England will be much tougher to score on than the likes of Poland, Austria, Romania and Turkey (the Netherlands faced one tough defensive side, France, in group play, and drew that match 0-0).The Dutch have controlled possession for the most part in this tournament, but were outpossessed 62-38 by the French. Despite conceding possession, the Netherlands finished that match with eight shots (four on target).How Netherlands-France went could be instructive given that France are much more similar to England than any of the other Dutch opponents to date.England Proving Value of Substance Over StyleDating back to the 2018 World Cup, England have made winning ugly (or you could call it low-scoring) a habit. Manager Gareth Southgate's team reached the semifinal of the 2018 WC and the final of Euro 2020 (played in 2021), with a quarterfinal loss to runner-up France in the 2022 World Cup.And, it should be noted, France have been successful with a similar formula at the last two World Cups, winning in 2018 and reaching the final in 2022.Whether you find it aesthetically pleasing or not, England's ability to limit chances for their opponents keeps their matches close, and this team is getting better and better at finding a way in extra time or PKs when it has to.It also helps that when they've fallen behind, young stars Jude Bellingham (against Slovakia) and Bukayo Saka (against Switzerland) have proven that they can produce something spectacular out of nothing to keep their team alive.Netherlands vs. England Prediction, Best BetsIt's tough to see this match getting resolved in 90 minutes. The Dutch have gone to extra time in just one of their five matches in this competition, but England have been level with their opponent after 90 minutes in each of their last four.This game has the same feel as Portugal-France in the quarterfinals, which had low-scoring draw written all over it. The good news for bettors who don't mind banking on a draw after 90 minutes is that the payout -- at +180 -- is substantial.As for who will move on to meet Spain in the final, I'll take an England side that has thrived under pressure to win another nail-biter.Prediction: England 1, Netherlands 1 (England advance on penalty kicks)Best bets: Draw (+180 at BetMGM, FanDuel, DraftKings and bet365); England to qualify (-125 at ESPN BET)Newsweek may earn an affiliate commission if you sign up through the links in this article.

Here is more background ahead of tonight’s game, courtesy of the Associated Press: Uruguay is two wins away from a record-setting 16th Copa America title. Colombia is red hot, having gone 27 consecutive matches without a loss. Something has to give Wednesday night when the two South American powers clash in the tournament’s semifinals at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina. The winner will face Lionel Messi and defending champion Argentina, which beat Canada 2-0 in the other semifinal, on Sunday in Miami Gardens, Florida. Uruguay’s Manuel Ugarte scored the winning goal in the fifth round of a 4-2 penalty kick victory over Brazil in the quarterfinals after the teams played to a scoreless draw Saturday night. It was a physical match that included 41 fouls and just four shots on goal. But it was a costly win. Uruguay’s Nahitan Nández was sent off with a red card in the 74th minute for a dangerous tackle and defender Ronald Araújo sustained a muscle injury. Both are out against Colombia. Now comes another tough test in surging Colombia, which steamrolled into the semis with a dominant 5-0 win over Panama as Jhon Córdoba, James Rodríguez and Luis Díaz all scored in the first half. “It is a team that has been working together for a while, and that allows them to have a good start together,” said Uruguay coach Marcelo Bielsa. Bielsa said the choppy nature of the match against Brazil made it difficult for both teams to show their skills, but he expects a much more entertaining matchup against offensive-minded Colombia.",

                    "text": "Two of the trendiest darkhorses entering the 2024 Copa America -- Colombia and Uruguay -- meet on Wednesday night for a chance to take on Argentina in Sunday's Copa America final.Uruguay, which went 4-1-1 in CONMEBOL qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup last fall, and Colombia -- also solid in qualifying at 3-3-0 -- have justified the high expectations in this tournament.The Uruguayans cruised through Group C, winning three matches by a combined score of 9-1. Colombia also impressed in a tougher Group D, outscoring Paraguay and Costa Rica 5-1 before drawing Brazil in their final match of group play.While Uruguay needed PKs after a 0-0 stalemate in the quarterfinals to advance at Brazil's expense, Colombia drilled Panama 5-0 last Saturday night.Uruguay are the favorites in Wednesday night's match, with the moneyline odds shifting in favor of Darwin Nunez and Co. ahead of kickoff. Colombia enter the Copa America semifinals with a remarkable streak of 27 consecutive matches without a loss (21 wins, six draws).The last time these teams met, they played to a 2-2 draw in Barranquilla, Colombia on October 12, 2023, as a 91st-minute penalty by Nunez allowed Uruguay to escape with a point.Keep in mind that Copa America quarterfinal and semifinal matches do not feature extra time. That means that if Colombia and Uruguay are level after 90 minutes, plus stoppage time, they'll head straight to penalty kicks, which decided three of this competition's four quarterfinal matches.Colombia vs. Uruguay gets underway from Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, NC, at 8 p.m. ET on FS1.Colombia vs. Uruguay Moneyline OddsThe three-way moneyline odds below apply to the result after 90 minutes, plus stoppage time. BetMGM FanDuel DraftKings ESPN BET bet365 Colombia +200 +220 +220 +210 +220 Draw +170 +170 +170 +170 +170 Uruguay +180 +170 +175 +170 +170 In single-elimination matches like Colombia vs. Uruguay, anyone interested in simply picking the winner can check out the odds to advance market.Colombia vs. Uruguay Odds To Advance BetMGM FanDuel DraftKings ESPN BET bet365 Colombia -110 +100 +100 +100 +100 Uruguay -120 -122 -125 -125 -125 Colombia vs. Uruguay Betting AnalysisIt's hard to blame anyone for expecting yet another Copa America match to be decided by penalty kicks. Uruguay were one of three teams (the other two being Argentina and Canada) who reached this stage via PKs.At full strength, Colombia-Uruguay would seem like a toss-up, especially given Colombia's outstanding play not only in this tournament, but dating all the way back to Manager Nestor Lorenzo's hire back in June 22. (In fact, Colombia have a chance on Wednesday night to extend a 27-game unbeaten streak that actually began before Lorenzo was named head coach).But Uruguay are not at 100%, as neither starting right back Nahitan Nandez (suspension) nor Barcelona center back Ronald Araujo (injury) will be available against Los Cafeteros.Uruguay have the luxury of a proven veteran in Atletico Madrid's Jose Maria Gimenez stepping in for Araujo. But the likely replacement for Nandez, 31-year-old Guillermo Varela of Brazilian club Flamengo, has played only 43 minutes at the Copa America.James Rodriguez Leads Red-Hot ColombiaOne of the breakout stars of the 2014 World Cup has enjoyed a massive resurgence the last few weeks. Colombia's captain has been dominant, with five assists and a goal, and he's now two more wins away from cementing his place as one of the top Colombian players of all time.Rodriguez's passing has been one of the highlights of this tournament, and with a big game against Uruguay, he'd enter the final against Argentina as one of the biggest stories in a match featuring Lionel Messi and the reigning champs.Don't be surprised if this physical Uruguay side to try to bully Rodriguez, but the 32-year-old former Real Madrid and Bayern Munich star will have a great chance to make Uruguay pay on set pieces if that happens.Colombia vs. Uruguay Prediction, Best BetsIn addition to how well Colombia have played throughout their lengthy unbeaten streak, the way these teams' quarterfinal matches played out is another reason to like the underdogs, especially at odds as tempting as +220.While Los Cafeteros enjoyed a breezy 5-0 win over Panama, Uruguay had to survive a bloodbath against Brazil. In addition the red card that has sidelined Nandez for Wednesday's semifinal, Uruguay-Brazil featured four other yellow cards and an incredible 41 (!) fouls (26 by Uruguay, 15 by Brazil).So it would be an understatement to call Colombia the fresher side on Wednesday night. They also figure to enjoy at least a slight \"homefield\" advantage in Charlotte, as Colombia's supporters have packed stadiums across the country for their matches in this tournament.It all adds up to a hard-fought upset for Colombia looking like the most likely outcome. The question is whether to take Rodriguez and Co. on the moneyline or to advance. Given that Colombia had their 2026 qualifier against Uruguay won before a late red card allowed Nunez to equalize with a late penalty, let's go with the underdogs to pull this one out in 90 minutes.Prediction: Colombia 2, Uruguay 1Best bet: Colombia moneyline (+220 at FanDuel, DraftKings, bet365)Newsweek may earn an affiliate commission if you sign up through the links in this article.

Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch every game live, no matter where you are in the world.

The tournament's matches will be split across Fox and Fox Sports 1, with this match on FS1.

How to watch Uruguay vs. Colombia online from anywhere using a VPN If you find yourself unable to view Copa America 2024 matches locally, you may need a different way to watch the tournament; that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins. With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this. Using a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.

Quick tips for streaming Copa America 2024 using a VPN With four variables at play -- your ISP, browser, video streaming provider and VPN -- your experience and success when streaming Copa America matches may vary.If you don't see your desired location as a default option for ExpressVPN, try using the \"search for city or country\" option.If you're having trouble getting the game after you've turned on your VPN and set it to the correct viewing area, there are two things you can try for a quick fix. First, log into your streaming service subscription account and make sure the address registered for the account is an address in the correct viewing area. If not, you may need to change the physical address on file with your account. Second, some smart TVs -- like Roku -- don't have VPN apps you can install directly on the device itself. Instead, you'll have to install the VPN on your router or the mobile hotspot you're using (like your phone) so that any device on its Wi-Fi network now appears in the correct viewing location.All of the VPN providers we recommend have helpful instructions on their main site for quickly installing the VPN on your router. In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network's sports app, you'll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV. This is where having a VPN on your router will also help since both devices will appear to be in the correct location. Remember, browsers can often give away a location despite using a VPN, so be sure you're using a privacy-first browser to log into your services. We normally recommend Brave.",

Union workers are demanding a wage increase by 3.5 percent, improved bonus policies and an extra day of vacation. It also wants Samsung to agree to compensate workers for any lost wages during the strike. “We won’t go back until all of the demands are met,” Mr. Lee said. Last week, Samsung said that it would report a larger-than-expected jump in operating profit for the second quarter, of $7.5 billion. The company’s stock has recently set a series of multiyear highs as demand for chips to power A.I. applications has soared. For decades, Samsung was known for its aversion to organized labor, and unions have organized workers at the company only in the past several years. Labor strikes in South Korea are not uncommon. Since February, over 10,000 doctors walked off the job in protest of government plans to increase the number of admitted medical students. Last spring, thousands of construction workers rallied over discontent with the country’s labor policies.",

                    "text": "Workers at South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics will extend an unprecedented strike over pay and benefits \"indefinitely,\" its labor union said in a statement on Wednesday. The union's demands include a 3.5% increase in members' base wage, improved transparency in pay, and compensation relating to the economic losses of members who participated in the strike. The National Samsung Electronics Union, which has about 30,000 members, had begun a three-day general strike on Monday, after both parties could not agree on wage increase rate, vacation system and bonuses after several rounds of discussions, according to local media reports. This is the first strike by the labor union in Samsung Electronics' entire 55-year history, according to local media. \"Don't get tired,\" the NSEU statement read, according to a Google-translation. \"Absolutely prohibited from going to work until executive instructions are given,\" the labor union urged its members. Samsung, which told local media on Tuesday that chip production had not been disrupted in the first two days of the strike, said on Wednesday it would \"ensure no disruptions occur in the production lines\" with the extension of the strike. \"The company remains committed to engaging in good faith negotiations with the union,\" Samsung said. The NSEU, which extended the strike saying Samsung management was not keen on holding discussions, asserted the strike had disrupted chip production. Samsung Electronics is the world's largest maker of memory chips, commonly found in consumer devices such as smartphones and laptops. Shares of Samsung Electronics were down 0.34% Wednesday morning. Separately, South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor and its labor union reached a tentative wage agreement on Monday, averting a strike planned for Wednesday and Thursday, local news agency Yonhap reported. The agreement includes a 111,200-Korean won ($81) increase in monthly basic salary, as well as a bonus and company shares. – CNBC's Lim Hui Jie contributed to this report.",

                    "text": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Unionized workers at Samsung Electronics declared an indefinite strike Wednesday to pressure South Korea’s biggest company to accept their calls for higher pays and other benefits. Thousands of members of the National Samsung Electronics Union launched a temporary, three-day strike on Monday. But the union said Wednesday that it was announcing an indefinite strike, accusing the management of being unwilling to negotiate. Samsung Electronics says there have been no disruptions to production. “Samsung Electronics will ensure no disruptions occur in the production lines,” a Samsung statement said. “The company remains committed to engaging in good faith negotiations with the union.” However, in a statement posted on its website, the union said it has engaged in unspecified disruptions on the company’s production lines to get management to eventually come to the negotiating table if the strikes continue. “We are confident of our victory,” the union statement said. The union statement didn’t say how many of its members would join the extended strike. It earlier said that 6,540 of its union members had said they would participate in the earlier, three-day strike. That would represent only a fraction of Samsung Electronics’ total workforce, estimated at about 267,860 globally. About 120,000 of them are in South Korea. Earlier this year, union members and management held rounds of talks on the union’s demand for higher wages and better working conditions, but they failed to reach agreement. In June, some union members collectively used their annual leaves in a one-day walkout that observers said was the first labor strike at Samsung Electronics. About 30,000 Samsung workers are reportedly affiliated with the National Samsung Electronics Union, the largest at the company, and some belong to other, smaller unions. In 2020, Samsung chief Lee Jae-yong, then vice chairman of the company, said he would stop suppressing employee attempts to organize unions, as he expressed remorse over his alleged involvement in a massive 2016 corruption scandal that removed the country’s president from office. The company’s union-busting practices had been criticized by activists for decades, though labor actions at other businesses and in other sectors of the society are common in South Korea. Thousands of South Korean medical interns and residents have been on strike since February, protesting a government plan to sharply increase medical school admissions.",

AFP via Getty Images Key Facts The National Samsung Electronics Union said the decision to go on an indefinite strike was made after the company’s leadership failed to engage in dialogue with them during a three-day walkout by some of its members, Yonhap News Agency reported. According to the union, around 6,500 of its members are presently participating in the strike—including more than 5,000 workers from the company’s semiconductor division. Samsung told several news outlets that the strike hasn’t caused any disruptions so far. On its website, the union claimed it had “clearly identified line production disruptions” and warned the company would “regret this decision” to not engage in dialogue. The union’s statement also warned that its remaining 25,000 members will not hesitate and join the strike to force the company to come to the negotiation table. According to Bloomberg, the union is first a smaller chip fabrication facility before turning its focus towards Samsung’s high-bandwidth memory chip production facility in Pyeongtaek.

                    "text": "SEOUL, July 10 (UPI) -- Unionized workers at Samsung Electronics declared an \"indefinite general strike\" on Wednesday, calling for a wage increase and other benefits in what has become the largest labor action in the tech giant's 55-year history. A three-day strike that began this week was scheduled to end on Wednesday. However, the National Samsung Electronics Union announced a change of plans, citing a lack of engagement from the company. The union \"confirmed that the company has no intention of dialogue even after the first general strike, and declared a second indefinite general strike from July 10,\" the NSEU said in a statement. \"We have confirmed that there will be a clear production line disruption, and the company will regret this decision,\" it said. \"Management will eventually bend its knees and come to the negotiating table. We are confident in our victory.\" The NSEU has more than 30,000 members, accounting for almost a quarter of Samsung Electronics' total South Korean workforce of roughly 125,000. A one-day strike held last month by the NSEU marked the first-ever walkout at the smartphone and chipmaking leader, which went decades without a significant labor union presence. Samsung, the country's largest private employer, changed its stance after a 2019 trial found dozens of top executives guilty of union-busting activities. Union leaders and Samsung management started wage negotiations in January but failed to come to an agreement. The NSEU's current demands include a 3.5% raise in base pay, an additional vacation day, an improved performance bonus system and compensation for all members who participated in the strike. More than 6,000 union members joined the initial three-day strike on Monday, with some 5,000 coming from the semiconductor division, the NSEU said earlier this week. Samsung Electronics said that there have been no disruptions in production lines so far and vowed that none would occur, according to local media. Analysts also predict a limited impact from the strike on the Suwon-based company. \"Because semiconductor factories rely on automated production and have low actual manpower requirements, even if the strike is prolonged, our current assessment is that it will not affect Samsung's production capacity,\" Avril Wu, an analyst at Taipei-based Trendforce, told UPI. The strike comes on the heels of the company's explosive profit growth in the second quarter, thanks to a strong recovery in the memory chip market driven by artificial intelligence demand. On Friday, Samsung Electronics said in a regulatory filing that its operating profit reached $7.5 billion for the April-June period, up 1,452.2% on year.",

                    "text": "Thousands of workers in South Korea have pledged to extend the first-ever strike at Samsung Electronics indefinitely, ramping up a campaign for better pay and benefits at one of the world’s largest smartphone and AI chip makers. A union representing about 30,000 staff – about a quarter of its employees in South Korea – said members were extending industrial action that was originally meant to last only three days, after management failed to give any indication that it would hold talks with them. “We haven’t spoken to management since we started the strike on Monday,” the National Samsung Electronics Union vice-president, Lee Hyun-kuk, said. Members are demanding a 3.5% increase in base salary and a day off to mark the union’s founding. Lee said management previously offered a 3% rise in base salary but the union is pushing for an extra 0.5% to reflect inflation. Lee said about 6,500 workers had been taking part in the strike this week, and the union was holding training sessions to encourage more to join. The union said it was already disrupting production on certain chip lines, with some equipment running more slowly. “We are confident of our victory,” the union statement said. However, Samsung denied the claims, saying there had been no impact on production at the leading subsidiary of the South Korean group. “Samsung Electronics will ensure no disruptions occur in the production lines. The company remains committed to engaging in good faith negotiations with the union,” the company said in a statement. Rounds of talks were held between union members and management earlier this year but failed to result in an agreement. It resulted in some union members using their annual leave to hold a one-day walkout in June that was believed to be the first labour strike at Samsung Electronics. It comes amid a fresh wave of union activity at major tech multinationals that have been in tense standoffs with workers over working conditions. That includes Amazon, where workers at its Coventry warehouse in the UK started voting in a “historic” trade union recognition ballot that could allow employees of the online retailer in Britain to bargain collectively for rights and pay for the first time.",

                    "text": "The strike by the National Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU) could ultimately take 31,000 workers, nearly a quarter of the company’s South Korean workforce, out of the workplace, though the current number of people who have walked off the job is much smaller. Roughly 6,000 workers struck the company beginning on Monday, but were expected to return to work on Thursday. The NSEU, however, says the company has been unwilling to negotiate a growing dispute over compensation, so it has made the walkout an open-ended one. The union did not say how many members would take place in the indefinite strike, but conceded to Reuters it did not have enough time to educate members about the labor issues. In addition to higher salaries, the union is seeking an extra day of annual leave for union workers and changes to the employee bonus system. Samsung says there have been no production disruptions due to the labor stoppage, adding it “remains committed to engaging in good faith negotiations with the union” in a statement. The union, on its website, said it was “confident of our victory.” Even if all of the NSEU’s members join the strike, something that is far from certain, that represents a fraction of the company’s global workforce. Samsung employs more than 267,000 people around the world, with 120,000 in South Korea alone. Labor actions are a new thing for Samsung, which activists have long accused of union-busting. A one-day walkout in June was the first labor strike the company has experienced. The announcement of the NSEU strike case comes as Samsung held its latest Unpacked event in Paris, which saw the unveiling of the Galaxy Ring health-tracking device, a new generation of Galaxy Z folding phones, and a new line of Galaxy smart watches, including a new Ultra model.",

                    "text": "Samsung Electronics’ largest union in South Korea announced it would start an indefinite strike on Wednesday after a previous three-day walkout failed to secure the workplace gains its members are fighting for. The National Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU) said its union of 31,000 members was striking after 6,000 of its members who largely work in the semiconductor division went on strike earlier in the week, CNN reported. NSEU workers, who comprise about a quarter of the company’s workforce, are calling for better pay and bonuses and improved working conditions. The union said Samsung will “regret” not coming to the bargaining table. “It will take a long time to restore facilities that are shut down due to a strike,” Soon Woomok, a union leader, told CNN. Samsung expects its second quarter operation to rise more than 1,450% year-over-year thanks to an AI boom and reported a 10-fold jump in profits for the first three months of 2024. But workers say they aren’t seeing that success translate into pay. “The company is not treating the employees properly,” Woomok told CNN on Monday. “Even though the operating profit is high, the company has been saying it’s in a crisis situation for over 10 years, and employees are increasingly dissatisfied with the lack of performance bonus increases.” Samsung told the outlet it is “committed to engaging in good faith negotiations with the union,” and said it will ensure the strike doesn’t disrupt its production lines.",

                    "text": "Workers at South Korean tech giant Samsung are set to extend their strike over pay and benefits indefinitely. The National Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU) announcement follows a three-day general strike that concluded with no progress in negotiations. Consequentially, the NSEU, which represents a staggering 30,000 workers, called for the extended strike: “The company has no intention to engage in a dialogue even after the first general strike.” Samsung worker union ups the pressure So far, an estimated 6,500 workers have participated in the strike action. A protest on Monday also attracted 3,000 participants, however Samsung disputes claims of disrupted production (via BBC): “Samsung Electronics will ensure no disruptions occur in the production lines. The company remains committed to engaging in good faith negotiations with the union.” Local media reports suggest that this is the first strike in the company’s 55-year history. Workers are demanding a 3.5% increase in base wages, better pay transparency and compensation for economic losses incurred by striking workers. Several rounds of discussion leading up to this week’s preliminary three-day strike were unsuccessful. Samsung Electronics is one of the world’s leading producers of memory chips, smartphones and televisions, with products spanning both consumer and commercial markets. With thousands of workers potentially staging a walkout, experts are predicting that disruption would be inevitable. Shares of Samsung Electronics traded flat to slightly lower on the Korea Stock Exchange following the union’s announcement of its strike extension. Moreover, the company’s $1,591 share price falls short of an all-time high of more than $2,000 in January 2021. TechRadar Pro has asked Samsung to comment on ongoing strike action and disruption. The company did not immediately respond.

Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is is questioned by reporters about the candidacy of President Joe ... [+] Biden, in the U.S. Capitol on Monday, July 8, 2024. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images Key Facts Pelosi did not give a definitive answer when asked by MSNBC if Biden has her support to be at the top of the Democratic ticket, but said “it’s up to the president to decide if he is going to run,” adding “we’re all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short.” “Whatever he decides we go with,” Pelosi said when pressed again on whether she supports Biden continuing his campaign. Pelosi urged Democrats to “hold off” on airing their opinions about how Biden should move forward with his campaign until the end of this week’s NATO summit in Washington. Pelosi’s statement comes as Biden has rebuffed calls for his resignation from at least nine Democratic lawmakers and told Congress in a letter Monday “it’s time for” discussions about his debate performance” to end. What To Watch For Biden will hold a press conference with reporters Thursday for the first time since the debate. Big Number 35. That’s the number of days until the Aug. 22 Democratic National Convention, when the party will formalize its presidential nominee. Tangent Pelosi has repeatedly expressed uncertainty about the future of Biden’s candidacy since the debate. She called concerns about his mental faculties “legitimate” in an interview with MSNBC last week and urged both Biden and Trump to take cognitive tests. Key Background Democrats are deeply divided on what to do about Biden amid fears within the party that he can’t beat former President Donald Trump. At least nine elected Democrats in Congress have called on him to step down in the race, while others, including chair of the influential Congressional Black Caucus, Rep. Steve Horsford, D-Nev., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have issued statements of support for Biden. The president appeared to be staving off his detractors this week as just one additional Democrat, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., has called on him to step aside, and another, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., walked back calls he reportedly made in private for Biden to step down.

                    "text": "By LISA MASCARO WASHINGTON (AP) — Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday “it’s up to the president to decide” if he should stay in the 2024 race despite President Joe Biden’s insistence he is still running for re-election, showing how unsettled the question remains among prominent Democrats and Capitol Hill. “We’re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short,” Pelosi said Wednesday on MSNBC. Pelosi has been widely watched for signals of how top Democrats are thinking about Biden’s imperiled candidacy, and her comments will be viewed as important for the party’s direction as they weigh possible alternatives in the campaign against Republican Donald Trump. Because of her powerful position as the former House speaker and proximity to Biden as a trusted longtime ally of his generation, Pelosi is seen as one of the few Democratic leaders who could have influence on the president’s thinking. Pressed on whether she personally wants Biden to stay on the top of the ticket as he has defiantly said he is staying in the race, Pelosi said, “I want him to do whatever he decides to do.” The lack of a full statement from Pelosi backing Biden’s continued campaign is what lawmakers are likely to hear most, suggesting that despite the president’s vow he is not stepping aside, his party still has questions about his candidacy and whether he is the best choice to confront Trump. Pelosi’s remarks come as Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, spoke forcefully about the danger of a second Trump presidency and said it’s for the president “to consider” the options. Stopping short of calling for Biden to drop out, Bennet said on CNN what he told his colleagues in private – that he believes Trump “is on track to win this election — and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.” Bennet said, “It’s not a question about politics. It’s a moral question about the future of our country.” Democrats have been reeling over the question of whether to continue backing Biden after his poor showing in the June 27 presidential debate with Trump and his campaign’s lackluster response to their pleas that Biden show voters he is up for another four-year term. House and Senate Democrats met privately Tuesday, their first group meetings back in Washington since the debate. While seven House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to end his candidacy, no Senate Democrats have gone that far. Bennet was among three Democratic senators, including Sen. Jon Tester of Montana and Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who spoke up during a private lunch Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it. Pelosi of California said Biden “has been a great president” who is beloved and respected by House Democrats. The Californian said she watched as he delivered a forceful speech at the NATO summit on Tuesday, and recounted his many accomplishments. While foreign leaders are in Washington this week and Biden is on the world stage hosting the event at a critical time in foreign affairs, Pelosi encouraged Democrats “let’s just hold off” with any announcements about his campaign. “Whatever you’re thinking, either tell somebody privately but you don’t have to put that out on the table until we see,” she said, how it goes “this week.”",

                    "text": "Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi avoided offering her personal opinion of whether President Joe Biden should step down or run for reelection during an appearance on “Morning Joe” on Wednesday, but in doing so she also avoided putting her full-throated support behind his reelection bid. When asked point blank if Biden has her support to be the head of the Democratic ticket, Pelosi replied, “It’s up to the president to decide if he’s going to run. We’re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.” The former Speaker added that Biden is “beloved” and “respected” and said “people want him to make that decision.” Of course, Biden has made clear that he’s already made his decision, issuing a statement earlier this week that he’s not dropping out of the race. He’s running. MSNBC host Jonathan Lemire followed up by pointing this out to Pelosi, asking again if she wants him to run, to which the former Speaker replied, “I want him to do whatever he decides to do, and that’s the way it is. Whatever he decides, we go with.” Earlier in the interview, “Morning Joe” cohost Mika Brzezinski confronted Pelosi with the growing calls from Democrats for Biden to drop out of the race in the wake of his disastrous debate performance and subpar ABC News interview with George Stephanopoulos. “That’s one version of the story,” Pelosi replied. “What I do want to say is that yesterday I was honored to be present at the president’s speech at NATO, he was absolutely spectacular. He was received over and over again with ovations for what he had to say and the force with which he said it.” The president has faced calls from both lawmakers and prominent donors to drop out of the race following the debate, and to make way for a more viable candidate to defeat Donald Trump. Despite this, Biden remains steadfast that he’s running, sending a letter to congressional Democrats on Monday. “I have heard the concerns that people have — their good faith fears and worries about what is at stake in this election. I am not blind to them,” Biden said. “I wouldn’t be running again if I did not absolutely believe I was the best person to beat Donald Trump in 2024.”",

Alex De Minaur withdrew due to an injury (torn cartilage in hip) that was sustained on the final point of his previous match against Arthur Fils on Monday. “I felt a loud crack and a scan confirmed the injury,” De Minaur said. “High risk of making it worse.\" Djokovic, 37 and coming off meniscus surgery, will now have three full days off before Friday’s semifinal against the winner between No. 13 Taylor Fritz and No. 25 Lorenzo Musetti. No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz will face No. 5 Daniil Medvedev in the other semifinal Friday. “I think it’s a big break for Novak,” ESPN’s Mary Joe Fernandez said on air. “Novak had lost to De Minaur earlier this season in Australia before the Australian Open.” She pointed out that Djokovic had to withdraw from the French Open ahead of the quarterfinal against Casper Ruud with the knee injury. “So for him he gets a little extra break on the knee,” she said. “He looked better in his last match....When you’re 37 years old and you’re coming in with an injury it’s a good thing to have the extra rest.” MORE FOR YOU NYT ‘Strands’ Hints, Spangram And Answers For Wednesday, July 10th Northern Lights Alert: Beware ‘Head-On’ Aurora Displays Say Scientists ‘The Acolyte’ Episode 7 Recap And Review: Woo-Hoo, Witchy Woman Djokovic is seeking his record 25th Grand Slam title and a record-tying eighth Wimbledon.

                    "text": "LONDON (AP) — Novak Djokovic’s smooth trip through the Wimbledon bracket got even easier on Wednesday, when he moved into his record-tying 13th semifinal at the tournament via a walkover because his quarterfinal opponent, Alex de Minaur, pulled out with a hip injury. Djokovic had knee surgery less than a month before the start of play at the All England Club, raising questions about whether he’d even be able to try to earn his eighth championship at the grass-court major and add to his men’s mark of 24 Grand Slam trophies. But, despite limitations on movement, the 37-year-old Djokovic has dropped only two sets so far, while facing a qualifier in the first round, a wild-card entrant in the second and only one seeded player, No. 15 Holger Rune. Djokovic was supposed to go up against No. 9 de Minaur on Wednesday, but instead will get three full days off before Friday’s semifinals. More eventful for Djokovic has been his interactions with some spectators at Centre Court. After beating Rune in straight sets on Monday, Djokovic told fans that a group of them showed “disrespect” toward him with the way they were cheering. Djokovic’s next match will come against No. 13 Taylor Fritz of the United States or No. 25 Lorenzo Musetti of Italy. Fritz and Musetti were scheduled to play their quarterfinal on Wednesday. The women’s quarterfinals Wednesday were 2022 champion Elena Rybakina vs. No. 21 Elina Svitolina, and No. 13 Jelena Ostapenko vs. No. 31 Barbora Krejcikova in a matchup between two past title winners at the French Open. No man has made it to as many Grand Slam semifinals as Djokovic’s 49. He and Roger Federer are the only men with 13 appearances in the final four at Wimbledon. De Minaur’s exit is the latest to come because of injury in Week 2 of the tournament. Players who stopped competing in the middle of fourth-round matches because they were hurt include No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov in the men’s draw, and No. 12 Madison Keys and No. 17 Anna Kalinskaya in the women’s. The hip issue for de Minaur, a 25-year-old Australian, arose right near the end of his four-set win against Arthur Fils on Monday. De Minaur said he heard a crack and knew something was wrong. He underwent medical tests Tuesday that revealed the extent of the problem but tried to practice on Wednesday morning in the hope he would be able to take on Djokovic. This was the first time de Minaur reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. “It’s no secret that, at this stage of my career, this was the biggest match of my career. So wanted to do anything I could to play,” de Minaur said. “I knew what the results were yesterday, but I still wanted to wake up today and feel some sort of miracle and not feel it while I’m walking.” He was told the hip could get worse if he played Wednesday. “The problem with me going out and playing is that one stretch, one slide, one anything, can make this injury (recovery) go from three to six weeks to four months,” de Minaur said. “It’s too much to risk.” ___ By HOWARD FENDRICH AP Tennis Writer",

                    "text": "WIMBLEDON, England -- Novak Djokovic's smooth trip through the Wimbledon bracket got even easier Wednesday, when he moved into his record-tying 13th semifinal at the tournament via a walkover because his quarterfinal opponent, Alex de Minaur, withdrew with a hip injury. De Minaur, an Australian who was seeded ninth at the All England Club, announced he was pulling out of the tournament hours before he and Djokovic were scheduled to play each other on Centre Court. \"Obviously not an announcement I wanted to make, by any means,\" de Minaur said at a news conference. \"I'm devastated.\" He explained that he heard a crack toward the end of his 6-2, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 fourth-round victory over Arthur Fils on Monday. De Minaur walked gingerly to the net when that match ended, but he downplayed the severity of things when he spoke to the media afterward. The walkover ties Djokovic with Roger Federer for the most Wimbledon semifinal appearances by a man in tournament history. The second-seeded Djokovic had knee surgery less than a month before the start of Wimbledon, raising questions about whether he would even be able to try to earn his eighth championship at the grass-court major and add to his men's mark of 24 Grand Slam trophies. But despite limitations in movement, the 37-year-old Djokovic has dropped only two sets while facing a qualifier in the first round, a wild-card entrant in the second and only one seeded player, No. 15 Holger Rune.

The extent of de Minaur's injury was clear from medical exams Tuesday, he said, but he wanted to at least give it a shot and try to play, if at all possible. But it was clear during a practice session Wednesday morning there was no way he could compete. He said he barely could walk before a match that would have been de Minaur's first quarterfinal appearance at Wimbledon. He made it that far at the French Open last month, too. \"It's no secret that, at this stage of my career, this was the biggest match of my career. So wanted to do anything I could to play,\" de Minaur said. \"I got the results yesterday. I knew what the results were yesterday. I still wanted to wake up today hoping that I would feel some sort of miracle and not feel it while I'm walking.\" He said he was told that he could make his hip worse if he played another match. \"The problem with me going out and playing is that one stretch, one slide, one anything, can make this injury [recovery] go from three to six weeks to four months,\" de Minaur said. \"It's too much to risk.\" De Minaur's exit is the latest to come because of injury in Week 2 of the tournament.

                    "text": "LONDON — Lorenzo Musetti reached his first Grand Slam semifinal by eliminating Taylor Fritz 3-6, 7-6 (5), 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 at Wimbledon on Wednesday and will take on Novak Djokovic next. The 25th-seeded Musetti, a 22-year-old from Italy, had never been past the third round at the All England Club – or the fourth round at any major tournament – until now. His victory over the 13th-seeded Fritz was the 37th five-setter at the All England Club this year, the most at any Grand Slam tournament. Now Musetti will go up against Djokovic with a berth in the final on the line. It will be Djokovic’s record-tying 13th semifinal at Wimbledon alone – equaling Roger Federer – and 49th Slam semifinal overall, extending a mark he already held. As Musetti pursues his first major championship, Djokovic seeks a 25th, including what would be an eighth at the All England Club. Djokovic’s smooth trip through this year’s bracket was made even easier when the man he was supposed to play in the quarterfinals Wednesday, Alex de Minaur, pulled out with a hip injury hours before their match was scheduled to begin. Playing at a sun-swathed No. 1 Court against Fritz, an American who is one of the sport’s biggest servers but fell to 0-4 in major quarterfinals, Musetti managed to accumulate 13 break points and convert six. The outcome-determining break came on a forehand winner by Musetti that made it 2-0 in the last set; moments later, another break made it 4-0. Queen Camilla, the wife of King Charles III, was in the stands and joined fans in doing the wave. There was not a ton of variety exhibited by either player; they were mainly content to trade groundstrokes from the baseline. But Musetti did manage to accrue points with effective drop shots, occasionally following them with successful passing attempts or lobs. Djokovic had knee surgery less than a month before the start of play at the All England Club. But despite limitations on his movement, the 37-year-old Djokovic has dropped only two sets so far — facing a qualifier in the first round, a wild-card entrant in the second and only one seeded player, No. 15 Holger Rune. Instead of going up against No. 9 de Minaur on Wednesday, Djokovic will get three full days off before meeting Musetti on Friday. The other men’s semifinal will be defending champion Carlos Alcaraz against Daniil Medvedev; they advanced Tuesday. Djokovic and Musetti have played each other six times previously. Djokovic has won five of those, including a five-setter at this year’s French Open that concluded after 3 a.m. It was in Djokovic’s following match in Paris that he tore the meniscus in his right knee. In the women’s quarterfinals Wednesday, 2022 champion Elena Rybakina grabbed nine of the last 11 games to defeat No. 21 Elina Svitolina 6-3, 6-2, and No. 31 Barbora Krejcikova eliminated No. 13 Jelena Ostapenko 6-4, 7-6 (4) in a matchup between two past champions at the French Open. The other women’s semifinal on Thursday will be No. 7 Jasmine Paolini of Italy against unseeded Donna Vekic of Croatia. The 25-year-old Rybakina — at No. 4 the highest seeded woman left in the draw — had seven aces and 28 winners to improve her record at the All England Club to 19-2. “Definitely, I have an aggressive style of game,” Rybakina said. “I have a huge serve, so it’s a big advantage.” Her match lasted 1 hour, 1 minute – shorter than the second set alone of Krejcikova against Ostapenko, who at one point ordered her coach to leave the stands. Krejcikova won her first Grand Slam title on the red clay at Roland Garros in 2021, but never had put together a five-match winning streak on grass until now. “There have been many doubts from the inside, but also from outside – from the outside world,” said Krejcikova, a 28-year-old from the Czech Republic who arrived at the All England Club with a record of just 6-9 in 2024. “But I’m super happy than I never gave up and that I’m standing here right now.” De Minaur’s exit is the latest to come because of injury in Week 2 of the tournament. Players who stopped competing in the middle of fourth-round matches because they were hurt include No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov in the men’s draw, and No. 12 Madison Keys and No. 17 Anna Kalinskaya in the women’s. The hip issue for de Minaur, a 25-year-old Australian, arose right near the end of his four-set win against Arthur Fils on Monday. De Minaur said he heard a crack and knew something was wrong. He underwent medical tests Tuesday that revealed the extent of the problem but tried to practice on Wednesday morning in the hope he would be able to take on Djokovic. This was the first time de Minaur reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. “It’s no secret that, at this stage of my career, this was the biggest match of my career. So wanted to do anything I could to play,” de Minaur said. “I knew what the results were yesterday, but I still wanted to wake up today and feel some sort of miracle and not feel it while I’m walking.” He was told the hip could get worse if he played Wednesday. “The problem with me going out and playing is that one stretch, one slide, one anything, can make this injury (recovery) go from three to six weeks to four months,” de Minaur said. “It’s too much to risk.” « Previous",

Baldwin arrived at court early with wife Hilaria and brother Stephen by his side, chatting with lawyers and scowling after taking his seat. Dressed in a suit and tie, Baldwin curiously took notes and wore a pair of burgundy eyeglasses that he removed from time to time. The state began its case with an opening statement by Erlinda Ocampo Johnson, a defense lawyer appointed by New Mexico as special prosecutor. “When someone plays make-believe with a real gun in a real live workplace, and while playing make-believe with that gun violates the cardinal rules of firearm safety, peoples’ lives are in danger, and someone could be killed,” Johnson said. “Ladies and gentlemen, that is what this case is about. It’s simple and straightforward. The evidence will show that someone who played make-believe with a real gun and violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety is the defendant, Alexander Baldwin.” A jury of 12, plus four alternates, was selected Tuesday. The panel includes 11 women and five men. This story is developing …",

                    "text": "By MORGAN LEE AND ANDREW DALTON SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A prosecutor told jurors that Alec Baldwin “violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety” in opening statements Wednesday at his trial for involuntary manslaughter. “The evidence will show that someone who played make believe with a real gun and violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety is the defendant, Alexander Baldwin,” special prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson said. She emphasized that the set of the film “Rust,” where cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, “a vibrant 42-year-old rising star,” was shot and killed, was a workplace. “The evidence will show that like in many workplaces, there are people who act in a reckless manner and place other people in danger,” Johnson said. “That, you will hear, is the defendant.” Johnson walked the jurors through the events leading up to the Oct. 21, 2021, shooting. She said on that day, Baldwin declined multiple opportunities for standard safety checks before the rehearsal and instead “did his own thing” with the revolver at the rehearsal where Hutchins was killed. “He cocks the hammer, points it straight at Miss Hutchins, and fires that gun, sending that live bullet right into Miss Hutchins body,” Johnson said. Johnson is a relative newcomer to the case, appointed in late April by the Santa Fe district attorney’s office. The trial will delve into the confluence of gun safety, high-wattage celebrity and a low-budget Western movie on the remote ranch set. The 16 jurors — 11 women and five men — come from a region with strong currents of gun ownership and safety informed by backcountry hunting. Four of the jurors will be deemed alternates while the other 12 deliberate once they get the case. The shooting death of cinematographer Hutchins nearly three years ago sent shock waves through the film industry and led to one felony charge against Baldwin that could result in up to 18 months in prison. Baldwin has pleaded not guilty. He entered the courtroom with a disposable coffee cup in his hand. His wife Hilaria Baldwin and brother, Stephen Baldwin, were seated close by in the audience, among relatives and friends of the defendant. He sat surrounded by his lawyers, wearing a dark blue suit in the downtown Santa Fe courthouse a short drive from the movie-ranch setting of scenes from “Rust.” Baldwin has claimed the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware that it was loaded with a live round, he said he pulled back the hammer — not the trigger — and it fired. Prosecutors have said they’ll present evidence that Baldwin went “off script” and failed to follow basic industry standards for firearms safety when he pointed the firearm at Hutchins on Oct. 21, 2021. Baldwin, the star of “Beetlejuice,” “Glengarry Glen Ross” and “30 Rock,” has been a household name as an actor and public personality for more than three decades. In court filings, defense attorneys have highlighted that the armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, already has been found responsible for the shooting, along with testimony that the gun had been checked by an assistant director before it was handed to Baldwin — and that the shooting was incomprehensible and shocking to the entire movie crew because of their belief that there was no live ammunition on set. Prosecutors have two alternative standards for proving the charge. One is based on the negligent use of a firearm. The other is proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Baldwin acted with total disregard or indifference for the safety of others. Testimony at trial will delve into shortcomings in a final safety check of the gun before Baldwin began rehearsing with it, as well as the mechanics of the weapon and whether it could have fired without a trigger pull. The live bullet that killed Hutchins also wounded director Joel Souza. ___ Dalton reported from Los Angeles. ___ For more coverage of Alec Baldwin’s involuntary manslaughter trial, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/alec-baldwin",

                    "text": "The prosecution and defense disputed whether Alec Baldwin violated the “cardinal rules of firearm safety” during their opening statements in the actor’s involuntary manslaughter case in the accidental shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Prosecutor Erlinda Johnson opened the states case by saying: “When someone plays make believe with a real gun, in a real life workplace — and while playing make believe with that gun, violates the cardinal rules of firearm safety — peoples lives are in danger, and someone could be killed.” She then called the case “simple” and “straightforward,” arguing that the evidence would show that Baldwin “played make believe with a real gun, and violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety.” Baldwin’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, called Hutchins’ death an “unspeakable tragedy,” but claimed: “Alec Baldwin committed no crime. He was an actor acting, playing the role of Harland Rust. An actor playing a character can act in ways that are lethal, that aren’t just lethal on a movie set. These cardinal rules — they’re not cardinal rules on a movie set. And I don’t have to tell you much more about this because you’ve all seen gun fights in movies. And the reason that can happen is because safety is ensured before the actor.” The case against Baldwin finally got underway three years after Hutchins was killed in an on-set accident on Oct. 21, 2021. The incident occurred when the prop gun Baldwin was using went off while the actor was rehearsing a scene with Hutchins and the film’s director, Joel Souza (who was also injured). Baldwin, who’s pleaded not guilty to the involuntary manslaughter charge, has maintained that he never pulled or hand his finger on the trigger of the gun when it went off. Instead, he’s claimed that, during the rehearsal, he pulled the revolver’s hammer back without fully cocking the gun, and the weapon fired when he released the hammer. In laying out the state’s case, Johnson told the jury that they would hear testimony from numerous people who would say the gun Baldwin was holding — a replica of an 1873 single-action revolver — was in working order by the time it reached him on the Rust set (witnesses include representatives for the manufacturer of the gun, Pietta Firearms, and the company that distributes Pietta’s wares in the U.S., EMF). Johnson also stressed that while the jury would frequently hear the term “prop gun” thrown around, they’d learn that a “prop gun is this real gun — it’s not a toy, it’s not made of rubber.” Johnson went on to say that the jury would see footage of Baldwin firing the gun and it working “perfectly fine” on the Rust set. She also said there was video footage showing that firearm safety protocols were not followed: “You will see [Baldwin] using the gun as a pointer — to point at people, to point at things. You will see him cock the hammer when he’s not supposed to cock the hammer. You will see him put his finger on the trigger when his finger’s not supposed to be on the trigger. You will hear about numerous breaches of firearm safety with this defendant and his use of this firearm.” And, Johnson said, the evidence would show that each time Baldwin handled the gun, he “did not do a safety check” with Rust armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter earlier this year and sentenced to 18 months in prison. Johnson told the jury that they would hear the reason Baldwin did not perform a safety check with the “inexperienced” Gutierrez-Reed was “because he didn’t want to offend her.” When it was his turn to speak, Spiro cast blame for Hutchins’ death elsewhere, saying that there were others on the Rust set who were “responsible for ensuring the safety of the set and the firearm — those people failed in their duties.” He argued, instead, that the most “critical issue” was “how a real bullet got on a movie set,” where dummies and blanks (“fake inert bullets that look like real bullets,” as Spiro put it) are used for close-ups and action shots. “You will hear no evidence, not one word, that Alec Baldwin had anything to do with that real bullet being brought onto that set,” Spiro said. A pivotal part of the defense’s argument centers around the moment when Baldwin was handed the firearm and the industry term “cold gun” was announced. “Meaning,” Spiro explained, “it had been checked, and double checked, by those responsible to ensure the gun was safe. It was just a prop. They all thought it was just a prop and could do no harm.” This story is developing…",

                    "text": "The involuntary manslaughter trial of Alec Baldwin for the 2021 shooting of Halyna Hutchins during the filming of Rust is underway in a New Mexico courtroom as both sides put forward their opening statements. According to The New York Times, prosecutor Erlinda O. Johnson began the case against Baldwin by showing the jury a photo of Hutchins and saying, “the evidence will show that someone who played make-believe with a real gun and violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety is the defendant, Alexander Baldwin.” She then accused Baldwin of mishandling the gun by cocking the hammer and having his finger on the trigger at improper times and asserted that there was a time when Baldwin requested to be filmed “running around shooting his gun.” Johnson claimed that the prosecution has proof that the gun was “functioning normally” and there was nothing wrong with it. One of the lawyers defending the actor, Alex Spiro, then told they jury while Hutchins’ death was “an unspeakable tragedy... Alec Baldwin committed no crime.” Spiro said Baldwin had been told his gun was “cold”, meaning there was nothing inside of it. “Cold guns can’t hurt people,” Spiro said. Baldwin’s defense team has built their argument on the fact that regardless of Baldwin’s actions with the gun, he cannot be guilty as he was told the weapon was empty. Instead of Baldwin taking the fall, Spiro lays the blame on the film’s crew and armorer. Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who worked as the armorer on Rust, has already been tried and sentenced to 18 months in prison for the part she played in the shooting.",

                    "text": "Almost three years after the fatal shooting on the movie set of Rust, prosecutors began to lay out their case against Alec Baldwin in a packed Santa Fe courtroom, painting a picture of an unsafe workplace on a tight budget with a lead actor who violated the “cardinal rules of firearm safety”. Proceedings in the actor’s involuntary manslaughter trial kicked off on Wednesday with the prosecution and defense offering their opening statements. The courtroom was filled to capacity with dozens of media as well as Baldwin’s wife and brother, who sat just behind the actor. The state said Baldwin acted in a reckless manner that led to the death of the cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who was shot on the film’s set at the Bonanza Creek Ranch, a popular filming location about 30 minutes outside the city, in October 2021. The actor and co-producer on the western was rehearsing when he pointed a prop firearm at Hutchins and the weapon fired a single bullet, killing Hutchins and injuring the director, Joel Souza. The evidence will show the gun was functional, prosecutor Erlinda Johnson said, despite Baldwin’s statements that it had malfunctioned. But Baldwin failed to do a safety check and repeatedly violated set safety rules with the weapon by leaving his finger on the hammer and trigger, and pointing it at people on set while filming, she argued. “That gun the defendant had asked to be assigned worked perfectly fine, as it was designed,” Johnson said. “He pointed the gun at another human being, cocked the gun and pulled that trigger in reckless disregard for Ms Hutchins’ safety.” The trial will focus extensively on the Colt .45 used in the shooting. Baldwin has long claimed that he did not fire the weapon. The prosecution contends that forensic testing on the gun shows the actor had pulled the trigger and that Baldwin was negligent in his handling of it. The defense argued in opening statements that Baldwin was focused on playing a character and was not responsible for checking the gun. Others on set were tasked with ensuring the weapon’s safety, defense attorney Alex Spiro said, namely the film’s armorer and first assistant director. The most critical issue in the case is how a real bullet got on the film set, he said. “The evidence will show that on a movie set, safety has to occur before the gun is placed in an actor’s hands,” Spiro said. “He was just acting as he has done for generations and it was the safety apparatus that failed them all.” As the trial got underway, the jury was shown footage of the chaotic aftermath of the shooting captured via a body camera worn by Nicholas LaFleur, a police officer who responded to the scene and the first witness to take the stand. The video shows medical first responders crowded around Souza and Hutchins on the floor of a movie set church. Souza can be heard screaming in pain as medics attempt to treat him and Hutchins. The first responders advise Hutchins to take deep breaths and call her “good girl” as she lies with her arm over her head. The bullet had entered underneath Hutchins’ right underarm and perforated her right lung before traveling through the spine and lacerating her spinal cord, prosecutor Johnson said in her opening statement. Hutchins was a vibrant “rising star”, Johnson said. Gloria Allred, the attorney representing Hutchins’ parents and sister, was in attendance during proceedings on Wednesday and carried a photo of the 42-year-old. This criminal case against Baldwin has been winding its way through the New Mexico legal system since January 2024, when a grand jury indicted him on a charge of involuntary manslaughter. Prosecutors had previously charged him with the same offense in 2023 but later dropped the charge and said they needed more time to review the evidence. Baldwin’s legal team had repeatedly attempted to get the charge against him dropped, and last month sought dismissal on grounds that prosecutors had allowed potentially “exculpatory evidence” to be destroyed in the FBI testing of the firearm before the defense could examine it. Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer denied those requests. On Tuesday, proceedings moved forward as a jury of 11 women and five men were selected from a pool of 70 people. Only three of the potential jurors said they had not seen or heard anything about the case, but all of those selected said that they had not formed an opinion about the incident and that they felt they could be fair. “Our job – the attorneys for both sides – is to make sure we get a fair and impartial jury,” prosecutor Kari Morrissey said on Tuesday. “We want to get jurors who can be fair to the state. We also want to get jurors who can be fair to Mr Baldwin.” The trial comes after Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the chief weapons handler on the Rust set, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to 18 months in prison. Legal experts have said that prosecutors may have a harder time proving Baldwin’s guilt after Gutierrez-Reed was deemed responsible in her trial. Read more on the case",

TMZ obtained video of Stephanopoulos on the streets of New York City on Tuesday where he was asked whether he thought Biden should step down. \"I don't think he can serve four more years,\" Stephanopoulos responded. White House spokesperson Andrew Bates pointed Fox News Digital to comments made at Tuesday's press briefing by White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who told Fox News' Peter Doocy that the president is committing to serve a full second term in office. The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. CRITICS PILE ON BIDEN FOLLOWING ABC INTERVIEW, BLAST HIS REFUSAL TO COMMIT TO COGNITIVE TEST: ‘DISQUALIFYING’ Stephanopoulos sat down with Biden for the president's first national interview since his disastrous debate performance last month, which has sparked unprecedented calls from members of the media and even a growing number of Democrats for him to withdraw from the 2024 race. The ABC interview was widely seen as a test for Biden to show he has the mental capacity to continue his reelection bid. However, the 22-minute sit-down has not eased tensions within his party. BIDEN REPEATEDLY DODGES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER HE'D TAKE NEUROLOGICAL TEST: 'NO ONE SAID I HAD TO' Biden raised eyebrows when he expressed uncertainty about whether he had watched the CNN debate, telling Stephanpoulos \"I don't think so, no.\" He shocked the country when he refused to commit to a cognitive test, repeatedly insisting he is tested every day in the role as the commander in chief. Biden also enraged Democrats when he said he would be content with a hypothetical defeat against former President Trump as long as he as he \"gave it [his] all.\" \"Look, Biden looked better and certainly more coherent than he looked during the debate, but there's nothing in this interview that is calming nerves of jittery Democrats who fear that Joe Biden is on a trajectory to lose this race, to lose to Donald Trump,\" ABC News chief Washington correspondent Jonathan Karl told Stephanopoulos in reaction to the interview on Friday. BIDEN PANNED FOR NOT BEING CERTAIN ABOUT WHETHER HE WATCHED THE DEBATE: ‘HE DOESN’T KNOW???' \"In fact, for some of those people, the interview is raising new concerns, particularly the fact that he is unwilling or unaware of the fact that he is in a dire situation here regarding the campaign, that he is losing, in the view of many Democrats and frankly in the polls you cited, that he is losing to Donald Trump,\" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Several members of the media, most vocally the editorial board of The New York Times, have called on Biden to withdraw from the 2024 race.

When approached by an unidentified pedestrian in New York City in an online video, the ABC anchor for “Good Morning America” — apparently not realizing he was being recorded — said “I don’t think [Biden] can serve four more years.” The video was first published Tuesday by TMZ. Watch it below.

You’ve… pic.twitter.com/58FYwrWvqg— Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) July 10, 2024 The brief clip begins with Stephanopoulos walking on the sidewalk looking at his phone before being approached by the bystander who asks, “What do you think? Do you think Biden should step down? You’ve talked to him more than anybody else has lately.” “I don’t think he can serve four more years,” Stephanopoulos replied off-camera. “You don’t think he can serve four more years? All right — that’s an answer,” the man recording says. Representatives for ABC News did not respond to TheWrap’s request for comment on the video. The ABC News anchor’s exclusive interview with the president premiered as a primetime special on Friday to 8.5 million viewers tuning in. The sit-down marked the first appearance by the president since the June 27 debate. During that interview, Stephanopoulos pressed the president on the issues of his age and capability. “Mr. President, I’ve never seen a president [at] 36% approval get reelected,” he said in the 22-minute unedited interview. Though there were no novel takeaways from the interview, Stephanopoulos was praised by fellow journalists for not letting up on the president. His vested concern with the state of U.S. politics as it relates to the presidency were clear during the interview. “Do you really believe that you’re not behind right now? … Just when you look at the reality, Mr. President,” he said, pushing Biden further on polling. “Inflation has come down. In those last few months, [Trump has] become a convicted felon. Yet, you’re still falling further behind.” Biden has since reiterated his position that he is staying in the race for the presidency. The president attempted to reassure the Democratic party in a statement he shared to his Instagram Monday. View this post on Instagram “I have heard the concerns that people have — their good faith fears and worries about what is at stake in this election. I am not blind to them. Believe me,” Biden’s letter to the Democrats on Capitol Hill read. “I can respond to all this by saying clearly and unequivocally: I wouldn’t be running again if I did not absolutely believe I was the best person to beat Donald Trump in 2024.”",

Hey. Excuse me. How you doin’? GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Good. How are you? RANDO: What do you think? Do you think Biden should step down? You’ve talked to him more than anyone else has lately. And yo an he honest… STEPHANOPOULOS: I don’t think he can serve four more years. RANDO: You don’t think he can serve four more years? Allright. That’s an answer. George's comment is telling, given he had an exclusive sit-down with the Prez just 4 days ago. George pressed Biden on his mental acuity and his dismal debate performance. Outside the White House bubble, George has spent more one-on-one time with the President than just about anyone. Telling, indeed, albeit perhaps for different reasons than those arrived at by the good folks at TMZ. That George Stephanopoulos has an opinion on things is not news. He airs them all the time on This Week. Take, for example, this screechy point of personal privilege he took in order to lecture everyone on the STAKES of this election (click “expand” for transcript): GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Good morning, and welcome to This Week. Until now, no American president had ever faced a criminal trial. No American president had ever faced a federal indictment for retaining and concealing classified documents. No American president had ever faced a federal indictment or a state indictment for trying to overturn an election, or been named an unindicted co-conspirator in two other states for the same crime. No American president ever faced hundreds of millions of dollars in judgments for business fraud, defamation and sexual abuse. Until now, no American presidential race had been more defined on what's happening in courtrooms than what is happening on the campaign trail. Until now. The scale of the abnormality is so staggering that it can actually become numbing. It's all too easy to fall into reflective habits- to treat this as a normal campaign where both sides embrace the rule of law, where both sides are dedicated to a debate based on facts and the peaceful transfer of power. But that is not what's happening this election year. Those bedrock tenets of our democracy are being tested in a way we haven't seen since the Civil War. It's a test for the candidates, for those of us in the media, and for all of us as citizens. The newsworthiness of Stephanopoulos’ statement is not the statement itself, but the venue in which he chooses to deliver it. Not during Friday’s funereal post-interview panel or to open This Week, but on the streets of New York. Not to the millions of Americans who choose to rely on him for political coverage, but to some rando on the street with a cellphone in his hand. And, of course, this begs more questions. Why did Stephanopoulos bite his tongue at this critical juncture? Was he muzzled by ABC News brass or did he self-censor on the air out of deference to a fellow Democrat? Also, how many more within the Regime Media harbor these same reservations, but hold their tongues out of dutiful partisanship where they would otherwise speak and editorialize freely? We shall soon find out. UPDATE: Per Pucks; Dylan Byers, Stephanopoulos issues a statement of sort-of regret, and ABC News distances themselves from the remark. There's going to be an on-air struggle session, isn't there?

The former Bill Clinton aide was recorded Tuesday in a video obtained by TMZ answering a question from a passer-by in Midtown Manhattan about Biden’s political future. “I don’t think he can serve four more years,” Stephanopoulos said. His comment echoed the sentiments of many in the Democratic Party who have called for the 81-year-old Biden to end his reelection bid over concerns about his mental acuity. However, Stephanopoulos quickly backtracked hours after the video made headlines, expressed regret for offering his candid response. “Earlier today I responded to a question from a passerby. I shouldn’t have,” the news anchor said. ABC News also tried to distance the network from Stephanopoulos’ opinion. “George expressed his own point of view and not the position of ABC News,” the Disney-owned news unit said in a separate statement. Stephanopoulos, who co-anchors both “This Week” and “Good Morning America” for ABC News, interviewed Biden last Friday following his bumbling performance in the June 27 debate. The journalist pressed Biden on whether he had taken cognitive tests, and how he might feel if he continued to run for the White House but lost the election to Trump. An estimated 8.5 million Americans watched at least some of Stephanopoulos’ 22-minute post-debate interview with Biden, which was rebroadcast on “This Week” on Sunday. The president gave multiple excuses for his pitiful performance at the first presidential showdown against Trump, saying that he was “exhausted” and “sick” with a “bad cold” before whining that he let Trump’s remarks “distract me.” Biden also couldn’t recall whether he had watched footage of his debate meltdown. Biden said his frequent errors on the debate stage in Atlanta were a “bad episode” rather than a sign of permanent deterioration, but refused to submit to a cognitive exam to prove that statement. “Look, I have a cognitive test every single day,” Biden said. “Every day, I’ve had tests. Everything I do. You know, not only am I campaigning, I’m running the world. And that’s not — it sounds like hyperbole, but we are the central nation of the world.”",

A video of the interaction, which TMZ published Tuesday, shows a person surreptitiously recording Stephanopoulos on a street in New York City as he approaches the veteran journalist and asks if he thinks Biden should step down. Stephanopoulos' voice is muddled in the audio, but he seems to say: \"I don't think he can serve four more years.\" The comment was a remarkable slipup from Stephanopoulos, who just days earlier had landed a high-stakes interview with Biden as the octogenarian president struggled to quiet internal party opposition to his nomination. The interview was widely seen as a make-or-break moment for Biden following his lousy debate performance, but it did little to stem concerns about the president's age and fitness for office. Stephanopoulos later confirmed the encounter. “Earlier today I responded to a passerby. I shouldn’t have,” he said in a statement from ABC News. The network distanced itself from Stephanopoulos’ comment, saying the anchor “expressed his own point of view and not the position of ABC News.” Stephanopoulos, who began his journalism career in the late 1990s after serving as White House communications director under President Bill Clinton, drew praise for gently but steadily pressing Biden last week on his mental acuity and chances at re-election. Biden has adamantly refused to step down from the Democratic presidential ticket. In a letter to congressional Democrats on Monday, he dismissed calls for him to withdraw, telling his colleagues: “The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it’s time for it to end.”",

                    "text": "Facing pressure from within his own party to abandon his reelection campaign, President Joe Biden is relying on labor unions to help make the case that his record in office matters more than his age. The 81-year-old Democrat is set to meet Wednesday with the executive council of the AFL-CIO, America's largest federation of trade unions. The AFL-CIO said the president has been booked to attend the meeting for more than a year, but his participation now involves much higher scrutiny after his weak debate performance against Donald Trump raised fears about his ability to compete in November's election. His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders. A person who has been involved in past executive council meetings described them as largely informal and unscripted, a sign that Biden will not be able to rely on a prepared text as he seeks to solidify support among a group of union leaders who are both loyal to his administration and pragmatic. The person insisted on anonymity to preview the private meeting. SEE ALSO: Biden dismisses diminishing poll numbers, low approval rating after debate A White House official, insisting on anonymity to preview the meeting, said that Biden intends to thank the union leaders for their support and outline his plans for the future. Biden is close to many union leaders who will be in the room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend. The council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members. So far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate.

After Biden was interviewed by ABC News last week in the aftermath of his poor debate, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, posted on X: \"Biden is an incredible President and tonight we saw that he's on top of the details. He has my support and we're ready to keep working for Biden-Harris to win in November.\" SEE ALSO: 5 takeaways from striking Biden-Trump presidential debate Some union leaders have been more targeted in their support for Biden and his continued candidacy. United Steelworkers International President David McCall said before Wednesday's meeting that his union \"proudly supports\" Biden, saying that his \"record of delivering for working people stands for itself.\" Kenneth Cooper, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was also firmly behind Biden, saying that his union members \"couldn't ask for a stronger advocate.\" Wednesday's meeting has become a test of the union movement's strategy to emphasize Biden's policy agenda as a way to overcome doubts about his candidacy. Biden routinely holds his events at union halls. He has conversed regularly with several of the union leaders at Wednesday's meeting, knowing that the group is a key link at the local level to the voters that he says make him the Democrats' best candidate in November. Over the course of his term, Biden has tied his administration to the idea that labor unions built the middle class. He visited a picket line during the auto strikes, backed the steelworkers union in objecting to Nippon Steel taking over U.S. Steel, saved pensions for union workers as part of his pandemic aid and sided with unions on a new rule to make more workers eligible for overtime pay. Biden is so mindful of union workers that he recently canceled a speech planned for the conference of the National Education Association in Philadelphia after the union's staff announced a strike and formed a picket line. One person familiar with the labor movement's thinking said there is an acknowledgment that Biden lost some ground among voters after the debate, but the unions have found that one-on-one conversations about Biden's agenda are mattering more to members and their families than his age and health. Their pitch is that Biden's agenda has directly helped union workers while Trump's plans could leave them worse off. The AFL-CIO has raised 42 specific objections to Trump's time as president from 2017 to 2021. It noted that the Republican, who recently proposed making tips paid to workers tax-free, had also as president implemented a proposal to let bosses pocket their employees' tips, among other concerns about his tax cuts and efforts to restrict unionization. Trump has also made a play for union members, having met in January with officials in the Teamsters Union and saying afterward that although Republicans generally don't get backing from organized labor, \"in my case it's different because I've employed thousands of Teamsters and I thought we should come over and pay our respects.\" The former president has portrayed himself as supporting blue-collar workers, with the Teamsters president Sean O'Brien later saying that there's \"no doubt\" that Trump enjoys some support from union members. O'Brien is scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee at Trump's invitation. In 2020, AP VoteCast found that 16% of voters came from union households and 56% of them supported Biden. Biden and Trump essentially split non-union households in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, meaning that the Democrat's edge with union households was likely a critical factor in his victory.",

The 81-year-old Democrat is set to meet Wednesday with the executive council of the AFL-CIO, America’s largest federation of trade unions. The AFL-CIO said the president has been booked to attend the meeting for more than a year, but his participation now involves much higher scrutiny after his weak debate performance against Donald Trump raised fears about his ability to compete in November’s election. His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders. A person who has been involved in past executive council meetings described them as largely informal and unscripted, a sign that Biden will not be able to rely on a prepared text as he seeks to solidify support among a group of union leaders who are both loyal to his administration and pragmatic. The person insisted on anonymity to preview the private meeting. A White House official, insisting on anonymity to preview the meeting, said that Biden intends to thank the union leaders for their support and outline his plans for the future. Biden is close to many union leaders who will be in the room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend. The council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members. So far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate.

The 81-year-old Democrat met Wednesday with the executive council of the AFL-CIO, America’s largest federation of trade unions. He told the crowd that even Wall Street was acknowledging the power of unions, as he once again articulated his vision for an economy built “from the bottom up and middle out.” “I said I’m going to be the most pro-union president in American history,” Biden told the cheering crowd. “Well guess what?

Their pitch is that Biden’s agenda has directly helped union workers while Trump’s plans could leave them worse off. The AFL-CIO has raised 42 specific objections to Trump’s time as president from 2017 to 2021. It noted that the Republican, who recently proposed making tips paid to workers tax-free, had also as president implemented a proposal to let bosses pocket their employees’ tips, among other concerns about his tax cuts and efforts to restrict unionization. Trump has also made a play for union members, having met in January with officials in the Teamsters Union and saying afterward that although Republicans generally don’t get backing from organized labor, “in my case it’s different because I’ve employed thousands of Teamsters and I thought we should come over and pay our respects.” The former president has portrayed himself as supporting blue-collar workers, with the Teamsters president Sean O’Brien later saying that there’s “no doubt” that Trump enjoys some support from union members. O’Brien is scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee at Trump’s invitation. In 2020, AP VoteCast found that 16% of voters came from union households and 56% of them supported Biden. Biden and Trump essentially split non-union households in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, meaning that the Democrat’s edge with union households was likely a critical factor in his victory.",

                    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden met Wednesday with the executive council of the AFL-CIO, America’s largest federation of trade unions, in an effort to shore up support from a critical constituency as he beats back continued calls to step aside in the 2024 campaign. “I think of you as my domestic NATO — not a joke,” the 81-year-old Democrat told the crowd gathered at headquarters. He extolled the power of unions and told them of his longstanding support for them, telling the crowd even Wall Street was acknowledging the power of unions, as he once again articulated his vision for an economy built “from the bottom up and middle out.” “I said I’m going to be the most pro-union president in American history,” Biden told the cheering crowd. “Well guess what? I am.” The AFL-CIO said the president has been booked to attend the meeting for more than a year, but his participation now involves much higher scrutiny after his weak debate performance against Donald Trump raised fears about his ability to compete in November’s election. His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders. Biden spoke with a handheld mic and no teleprompter in sight. He thanked the union leaders for their support, and outlined his plans for the future seeking to cast aside doubt over his reelection campaign. Biden is close to many union leaders who were in room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend. In announcing Biden, Shuler told the room he has supported jobs, manufacturing and created good union jobs in clean energy. She flat out told the president that he had union’s support. “You’ve always had our back — we have your back,” Shuler said to the president. The council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members. So far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate. But some statements of support are also worded diplomatically to suggest a degree of flexibility in case Biden chooses to drop out — saying they back the Biden-Harris administration and not just Biden personally. After Biden was interviewed by ABC News last week in the aftermath of his poor debate, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, posted on X: “Biden is an incredible President and tonight we saw that he’s on top of the details. He has my support and we’re ready to keep working for Biden-Harris to win in November.” Some union leaders have been more targeted in their support for Biden and his continued candidacy. United Steelworkers International President David McCall said before Wednesday’s meeting that his union “proudly supports” Biden, saying that his “record of delivering for working people stands for itself.” Kenneth Cooper, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was also firmly behind Biden, saying that his union members “couldn’t ask for a stronger advocate.” Wednesday’s meeting has become a test of the union movement’s strategy to emphasize Biden’s policy agenda as a way to overcome doubts about his candidacy. Biden routinely holds his events at union halls. He has conversed regularly with several of the union leaders at Wednesday’s meeting, knowing that the group is a key link at the local level to the voters that he says make him the Democrats’ best candidate in November. Over the course of his term, Biden has tied his administration to the idea that labor unions built the middle class. He visited a picket line during the auto strikes, backed the steelworkers union in objecting to Nippon Steel taking over U.S. Steel, saved pensions for union workers as part of his pandemic aid and sided with unions on a new rule to make more workers eligible for overtime pay. Biden is so mindful of union workers that he recently canceled a speech planned for the conference of the National Education Association in Philadelphia after the union’s staff announced a strike and formed a picket line. One person familiar with the labor movement’s thinking said there is an acknowledgment that Biden lost some ground among voters after the debate, but the unions have found that one-on-one conversations about Biden’s agenda are mattering more to members and their families than his age and health.

                    "text": "On Wednesday, The New York Times op-ed section published a blunt essay from George Clooney, where the actor and director, one of Hollywood’s more engaged political players, forcefully argues for President Joe Biden to step aside in his campaign for reelection and allow a new candidate to take on Donald Trump in November. Clooney, who has starred in and directed several politically minded films over his career, did not mince words in the essay, writing that the Biden he spent time with at the fundraiser that the Hollywood A-lister threw three weeks ago is not the same man who won in 2020, but is the one 51 million Americans saw with their own eyes at his disastrous debate performance on June 27. “Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe,” Clooney wrote of the debate performance that has sent Democrats into a panic and that is now dividing the party. “But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw. We’re all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we’ve opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.” The Oscar winner for the political thriller Syriana and nominee for Good Night and Good Luck, which follows the conflict between journalist Edward R. Murrow and U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy, floated the idea of several prominent Democrats stepping up to lead the ticket in November. Clooney suggests in the essay that the nominating process at the 2024 Democratic National Convention could “enliven our party and wake up voters.” He concludes: “Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.” More to come.",

                    "text": "Rep. Pat Ryan (D-NY) became the eighth House Democrat to call on President Joe Biden to withdraw from the presidential race on Wednesday, as the dam slowly begins to bend over the president’s political future. Ryan, the only vulnerable Democrat in New York said in a post to X that Biden is “no longer the best candidate to defeat Trump.” “Trump is an existential threat to American democracy; it is our duty to put forward the strongest candidate against him,” Ryan said. “For the good of our country, I am asking Joe Biden to step aside — to deliver on his promise to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders,” Ryan added. Ryan’s call for Biden to withdraw from the race was first reported by the New York Times in a phone interview with the congressman. He told the outlet he’d be doing a “grave disservice” if he said Biden was the best candidate to serve in November and said “for the good of our country, for my two young kids,” Biden should step aside as the Democratic nominee. “I really hope, with all my heart, that he will listen,” Ryan added. The vulnerable Democrat joins Reps. Raul Grijalva (D- AZ), Lloyd Doggett (D-TX), Mike Quigley (D-IL), Seth Moulton (D-MA), Angie Craig (D-MN), Adam Smith (D-WA), and Mikie Sherril (D-NJ) in calling for Biden to step aside and allow the party to choose a new nominee after the president’s lackluster debate performance on June 27. ​​CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Sherrill and Ryan are the only two House Democrats so far to call on Biden to withdraw from the race since the Democratic conference met on Tuesday to discuss the president’s candidacy. Most members emerged from the meeting silent or solely saying that Biden will be the nominee. Some said there was mostly unity in the room, while others said the caucus is “not even in the same book.” A fellow New Yorker, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), reversed course on Tuesday after originally joining the group of House Democrats calling for Biden to step aside.

                    "text": "Michael Douglas has long been a supporter of President Biden, but during Wednesday morning’s episode of “The View,” the actor admitted that George Clooney made “a valid point” in his New York Times op-ed calling on Biden to step aside. During Douglas’ interview, host Joy Behar made a point of noting that Douglas has always been behind Biden, before asking what he thought about recent calls for the president to drop out of the race. To that, Douglas admitted that he still “adores” Biden, but this particular election is more crucial than ever. “I don’t worry necessarily today or tomorrow, but a year down the line, I worry,” Douglas explained. “I am concerned.” Clooney’s op-ed was published just as “The View” went on the air — well before Douglas took the stage, though, so he theoretically could’ve had time to read it — but host Alyssa Farah Griffin offered Douglas the chance to respond to the actor’s impassioned plea. “Well, I think it’s a valid point,” Douglas said. “I mean, I’m deeply, deeply concerned. I mean, especially, it’s difficult because the Democrats have a big bench. I mean, they’ve got a lot of heavy-hitters.” He added that he wasn’t impressed by Biden’s performance at the debate, which should’ve been “relatively simple.” “Just don’t deal with all your facts, just deal with his lies,” Douglas said. You can watch Douglas’ full thoughts on Clooney’s op-ed, and Biden in general, in the video above.",

                    "text": "George Clooney was all smiles at his recent Hollywood fundraiser for Joe Biden, where he and Julia Roberts raised a record sum for the president’s re-election campaign. Now, in a dramatic about-face, Clooney has withdrawn his support for Biden and is spilling the beans about what it was like behind the scenes — saying the president showed clear signs of cognitive decline at the celebrity-filled event last month. In an op-ed Wednesday for the New York Times, George Clooney said he no longer believes Joe Biden can win in November and called on Democrats to find a replacement candidate. He also painted a dire picture of Biden’s mental acuity. “It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe ‘big F-ing deal’ Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,” Clooney wrote. “Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw. We’re all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we’ve opted to ignore every warning sign.” Clooney continued: “This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won’t win the House, and we’re going to lose the Senate. This isn’t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I’ve spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.” Widely circulated video from the Hollywood fundraiser showed Biden awkwardly freezing up on stage, with former President Barack Obama taking his arm and gently guiding him away. The video was one of several of Biden’s public malfunctions that White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre dismissed as “cheap fakes.” This is George Clooney’s fundraiser last month where Obama had to guide Biden off the stage by his hand… pic.twitter.com/Q9OrqV8BjQ https://t.co/6zQ1lNBeWo — ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Tried To Tell You….?‍♂️ (@KingMike33) July 10, 2024 The Associated Press even issued a “fact check” of the moment, concluding that Biden simply “paused” on stage. The AP cited White House spokesperson Andrew Bates who described the moment as “the President taking in an applauding crowd for a few seconds.” Clooney called on Congressional leaders — including Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, and Nancy Pelosi — to ask Biden to “voluntarily step aside.” “Would it be messy? Yes. Democracy is messy. But would it enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out? It sure would,” he wrote. Courtesy of CNN Presidential Debate Among the names Clooney floated as a potential replacement for Biden are: Wes Moore, Kamala Harris, Gretchen Whitmer, Gavin Newsom, Andy Beshear, J.B. Pritzker. Clooney’s Hollywood fundraiser brought in more than $30 million for Biden’s campaign. George Clooney is part of a growing number of entertainment industry leaders and fundraisers who are calling for Biden to drop out of the race. Others include Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, veteran studio boss Barry Diller, and Lost creator Damon Lindelof. On Sunday, Rob Reiner — one of Biden’s most loyal Hollywood supporters — called on the president to “step down.”",

                    "text": "Rob Reiner doubled down on his belief that President Joe Biden should halt his reelection campaign to make way for a younger Democrat nominee in a social media post Tuesday in which he applauded George Clooney’s New York Times op-ed calling for the president to do the same. Reiner, spurred on by the Clooney op-ed, resurfaced remarks he made over the weekend that it was “time to stop f–king around” and find a new candidate. “My friend George Clooney has clearly expressed what many of us have been saying,” Reiner said on X. “We love and respect Joe Biden. We acknowledge all he has done for our country. But Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside.” This is the same sentiment Reiner shared over the weekend when he first called for Biden to step down. “It’s time to stop f–king around,” the director tweeted Sunday. “If the convicted felon wins, we lose our Democracy. Joe Biden has effectively served U.S. with honor, decency and dignity. It’s time for Joe Biden to step down.” Clooney’s op-ed hit the New York Times Wednesday, and like many prominent Democrat donors, he pointed out that Biden likely doesn’t have what it takes to secure another term in office. “The one battle he cannot win is the fight against time,” Clooney said. “None of us can. It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe ‘big F-ing deal‘ Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.” “We are not going to win in November with this president,” the actor added. “On top of that, we won’t win the House, and we’re going to lose the Senate.” Reiner isn’t the only big Hollywood name that Clooney’s op-ed convinced into opening up. Michael Douglas, who has been a longtime Biden supporter, spoke with “The View’s” Joy Behar about the op-ed and his thoughts. “I don’t worry necessarily today or tomorrow, but a year down the line, I worry,” Douglas explained. “I am concerned.”",

                    "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 Prakhar Khanna Alongside the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Samsung also announced the Galaxy Z Flip 6 at its July Unpacked event. Last year with the Galaxy Z Flip 5, the company introduced a major redesign, so it’s focusing on under the hood upgrades with the new flip phone. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 features meaningful upgrades like better camera hardware and packing a bigger battery in a similar design. Galaxy Z Flip 6 Features Subtle But Useful Design Upgrades Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen Prakhar Khanna At first glance, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 might seem the same as the Flip 5, but there are a few noticeable changes. For instance, the camera module now features the same color as the body, giving it a bolder look. Like the Galaxy Z Fold 6, the Flip 6 sports flatter sides as well. These give it a boxier but comfortable in-hand feel. At 85.1 x 71.9 x 14.9mm folded and 165.1 x 71.9 x 6.9mm unfolded, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is slimmer than its predecessor but weighs the same 187 grams. I got to play around with it for 30 minutes, and it felt like a light but premium phone. The back has a nicer feel to it, too. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is also IP48 dust and water-resistant, as opposed to the IPX8 rating on the Flip 5. This means the new Samsung flip phone is protected against a limited amount of dust ingress (particles measuring 1mm or more) at 4, whereas the Flip 5 didn’t feature dust resistance. It’s also protected against water with its 8 rating, which means it can withstand immersion in water up to 1m for a limited time. Similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 6, the Flip 6 no longer features a deep crease on the folding display. It has a new hinge design that helps minimize the crease while keeping the sturdiness intact. In my hands-on time, I noticed the crease only in certain lighting conditions. It’s much better than the Galaxy Z Flip 5 crease.

The Galaxy Z Flip 6 gets a RAM boost alongside the processor upgrade. If the Galaxy S24 is any indication, you should expect great performance and good battery life on the new Flip — more so because it packs a bigger, 4,000mAh battery (vs 3,700mAh on Flip 5). It’s the same cell capacity as the Galaxy S24, so I’m hoping to see an improvement over the Galaxy Z Flip 5’s battery life. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 should also provide better gaming performance for longer sessions because Samsung has added a vapor cooling chamber for the first time to its Flip lineup. Meaningful Camera Upgrades And AI Galaxy Z Flip 6 Flex mode camera autofocus Prakhar Khanna The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 sports a new camera setup. You get a 50MP primary camera with dual-pixel autofocus and an 85-degree field of view, which is a significant upgrade over the aging 12MP camera found on the Flip 5. It is accompanied by a 12MP ultrawide camera with a 123-degree field of view, which remains the same as before. Samsung has also added meaningful AI upgrades to the camera. For instance, it can now recognize your position and zoom in or out for the best framing choice. The Auto Zoom feature will zoom in automatically if you are nearer to the frame and zoom out when farther away. Like the Galaxy Z Fold 6, you get an AI-powered Portrait Mode that uses AI to clear outlines, create authentic facial expressions, and produce natural bokeh. Another useful AI feature is Interpreter: Conversation mode, where the outer display shows the translated conversation to the other person while the inner display shows the translation from their language to yours. Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6: Everything Else Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 Prakhar Khanna The Galaxy Z Flip 6 features the same 3.4-inch Super AMOLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate and a 6.7-inch Full HD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 2,640×1,080 resolution. It introduces a new feature called interactive wallpaper on the cover screen that responds to touch and movement. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 also includes a Photo Ambient feature on the cover screen, which changes based on the time and weather. You get all other AI features found on the Fold 6, such as Photo Studio, sketch-to-image generation, and more. The 4,000mAh battery charges at the same 25W speed, which is rated to reach 50% charge in 30 minutes. You also get support for wireless charging and wireless power sharing. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and 5G with both nano SIM and eSIM. Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6: Price and Availability Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 colors Prakhar Khanna The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 has received a price bump, now starting at $1,100. Pre-orders are open, and it will be available for sale starting July 24 alongside the other new Galaxy devices. Color options include Silver Shadow, Yellow, Blue, and Mint, while Craft Black and Purity White colors are available exclusively on Samsung.com. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

The best evidence of that is the new Galaxy Z Flip 6, the latest clamshell foldable from Samsung that was announced at Galaxy Unpacked on Wednesday morning. This year's edition comes in four colors: Yellow, Blue, Mint, and Silver Shadow. Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 specs From a hardware perspective, this is arguably the least Samsung has done to iterate on a Flip foldable since the line debuted. However, what few improvements Samsung made are important on paper — and software enhancements are a thing, too. Here are the basic specs, with differences from last year's Flip 5 noted in parentheses: 6.7-inch AMOLED inner display with 120Hz refresh rate3.4-inch cover display with 60Hz refresh rate12GB RAM (was 8GB on Flip 5) 256GB or 512GB storageQualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor (was Gen 2 on Flip 5)4,000mAh battery (was 3,700mAh on Flip 5) In other words, the Z Flip 6 has functionally identical displays and the same amount of storage as last year's phone, while the RAM, processor, and battery have all been upgraded. But wait, there's more. The Z Flip 5's main wide angle rear camera lens was a paltry 12MP shooter, but Samsung replaced that with a 50MP lens this year. Although the Galaxy Z Flip 6's 12MP ultrawide camera doesn't have any hardware upgrades, Samsung boasts that it has better low-light noise reduction and now supports HDR video and 4K video at 60 frames per second. Plus, all the Galaxy AI features that rolled out on the Galaxy flagships earlier this year are now available on the Galaxy Z Flip 6. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is now available for preorder with a starting price of $1,099.99, a $100 price increase over its predecessor's price tag.",

                    "text": "The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, the popular foldable that unfurls into a tablet, debuted at Unpacked. No, there aren't any major hardware changes on the next-generation foldable, but as you might have guessed, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is leaning heavily into AI. Galaxy AI made its big splash at the start of the year with the new Galaxy S24 series (before landing on older devices). And now, Galaxy AI is continuing its domination across the Galaxy universe, injecting itself into the Galaxy Z Fold 6 — and other new devices unveiled at Unpacked, including the Z Flip 6, Galaxy Ring, and Galaxy Watch Ultra. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 gets an AI-powered boost The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is packed with AI-powered tools from the Galaxy AI suite: Note Assist (translation and summaries via Samsung Notes)PDF overlay translation (text translation in PDFs)Composer (generates text for emails and social media apps)Live Translate (translates conversations on Samsung's native calling app and third-party apps like WhatsApp) Portrait Studio (creates 3D avatars based on your portraits)Interpreter (Galaxy AI steps in and translates languages between two participants)Instant Slow-mo (instantly slow down videos) Interpreter is particularly useful on the Galaxy Z Fold 6, as it comes with a new conversation mode that lets both parties view translations on the main and cover displays. Plus, Interpreter supports one-way translation, so you can have it \"listen\" to something and translate it for you. There's also a new Sketch-to-Image Galaxy AI feature, which offers image-based options from your sketches and drawings. You will also get the Google Gemini app built into the Z Fold 6 (and other Galaxy Z series devices). After saying \"Hey Google,\" you can invoke the Gemini overlay, allowing you to get started with AI-facilitated tasks. Galaxy Z Fold 6 also supports Circle to Search, an Android feature Google announced earlier this year. Larger display Samsung widened both displays on the Galaxy Z Fold 6. However, the minor increase is more noticeable on the outside screen. The 2,376 x 968-pixel AMOLED cover display is now 6.3 inches, up from 6.2 inches. Like its predecessor, the refresh rate can still climb to 120Hz. There's also a brighter display that can reach 2,600 nits. Gaming According to Samsung, some mobile gamers gravitate toward the Galaxy Z Fold 6 due to its 7.6-inch, 120Hz display. It's a phone that lets you enjoy ample screen estate while gaming. When you're done, you can fold it into a more compact form. It's also worth noting that Samsung packed a larger vapor chamber inside the Z Fold 6. Plus, the graphics support ray tracing. Cameras There aren't any significant camera upgrades on the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 5, you're still getting the following specs: 10MP selfie camera4MP under-display camera50MP wide camera12MP ultra-wide camera Of course, with AI being the spotlight this year, you can take advantage of Photo Assist within the Gallery app, allowing you to take advantage of generative AI editing tools like Generative Edit. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 comes in three colors, Silver Shadow, Pink, and Navy, as well as two Samsung.com exclusive colors: Crafted Black and White. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 has a starting price of $1,899.99. It's available for preorder now.",

                    "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The Samsung Unpacked 2024 summer event has finally arrived with the brand unveiling its latest devices in Paris this week. The tech giant launched a number of exciting updates to its foldable phones, including the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 but also a new Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, earbuds—and the Samsung Galaxy Ring. Some of the new devices unveiled during Samsung Unpacked 2024 include new foldable phones and the ... [+] new Samsung Galaxy Ring. ILLUSTRATION: FORBES / PHOTO: CHRISTIAN DE LOOPER FOR FORBES Curious about what’s new from Samsung? We break down the updates and highlights on every device launched below. It’s all available for preorder right now. Read on to learn more about the latest foldable phones, smartwatches and more. MORE FROMFORBES VETTED Casper One Mattress Review: Comfort With A New And Improved Design By McKenzie Dillon Forbes Staff The 24 Best Early Prime Day TV Deals You Can Find Right Now By Alison Barretta Contributor Samsung Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 6 Gets Minor Upgrades The biggest unveiling of the big show took the form of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6. While it may not necessarily look radically different from previous-generation Z Fold book-style phones, it boasts some serious upgrades that enhance its status as a productivity tool. Notably, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is not only slightly slimmer but also lighter with a reduced weight from the 252.8 grams of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 to now 239 grams. It may not seem like much, but when you’re taking notes or gaming on the screen, it’s a large enough amount that you’ll notice the difference in your hand. When unfolded the device is a little shorter and wider than the Galaxy Z Fold 5, but more importantly, it’s a bit thinner—though only 0.5mm so. And the outer display is a little larger at 6.3 inches. The device has a slightly different shape too—with more squared-off corners, rather than the rounded corners found on the Z Fold 5. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 now has sharper edges. Christian de Looper for Forbes The interior display may be the same size, but it’s better. The screen now offers a brightness of an impressive 2,600 nits, which is far higher than the previous-gen model of 1,750 nits. As expected, the phone gets a chip upgrade in the form of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, so it’ll be able to handle everything you can throw at it in 2024. That’s even more true given the fact that the vapor chamber inside the phone is larger, allowing for better cooling. Samsung built a host of AI features into the Fold 6 as well, fully integrating the Google Gemini app as the AI assistant on the phone. With Gemini, when you say the “Hey Google” hotword, Gemini will activate. The Fold 6 also debuts some new software image editing and creation tools such as Sketch To Image that can help users enhance photos and create new AI images altogether. Other aspects of the phone remain the same—the phone gets AI camera improvements, but the actual camera hardware is the same as before (12MP ultrawide, 50MP wide, 10MP selfie and 4MP under display sensors). And, the battery is still the same size (4,400mAh). The Galaxy Z Fold 6 costs $1,900 and is now up for preorder, with full availability on July 24. It comes in Silver Shadow, Pink and Navy. If you order online from Samsung, there are two more colorways available: Crafted Black or White. Samsung Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 Massive Upgrades In The Small But Mighty Galaxy Z Flip 6 Phone While the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 gets some nuanced upgrades, Samsung added some serious upgrades to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6. Like its larger foldable sibling, the clamshell-style device has the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and adds an impressive 12GB of RAM, up from 8GB. It also has a larger 4,000mAh battery. The new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 doesn't look all that different from its predecessor the Z Flip 5 at ... [+] a first glance, but there are actually some major updates. Christian de Looper for Forbes The design of the device is a little more seamless, too. When you choose a color, that color will now be shown on the entire phone instead of just the back panel. It’s a small change, but helps make the phone feel a little more consistent and customizable. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 is available in seven colorways, including this Yellow that's more of a ... [+] golden hue. Christian de Looper for Forbes The camera gets some hefty upgrades, though it remains to be seen how this translates to better images. Now, the FlexCam (the main camera) clocks in at 50MP, up from 12MP on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5. The ultrawide camera is a 12MP while the selfie camera is 10MP. It features a slew of new upgrades, including a Camcorder Grip that allows for smoother videography and an AI Auto Zoom feature in the FlexCam. Everything else about the device is more or less the same, with the same-sized displays that have the same resolution, so it keeps that sleek, uniform look. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 starts at $1,100, and is now up for preorder. Shipping begins July 24. The device is available in Silver Shadow, Yellow, Blue and Mint. Samsung Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra An All-New Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra The all-new Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is Samsung’s first-of-its-kind rugged smartwatch. It’s bigger than the standard Galaxy Watch 7 with a more durable, titanium build. The Galaxy Watch Ultra somewhat replaces the previous Galaxy Watch Pro models—though again, it trades in the slimmer design for a bigger, more durable build. The Galaxy Watch Ultra is available in one size, and it has three buttons on the side and a 1.5-inch display. The device has a titanium build, making it stronger than the stainless steel in the new Galaxy Watch 7 devices. It also has 10ATM water resistance, which basically means that it’ll withstand depths of up to 100 meters, so you can use it for scuba diving and swimming. The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra has a bigger display size and a much longer battery life than ... [+] previous smartwatches from the brand. Christian de Looper for Forbes The software on the device has some upgrades too, including a new Multi-Sports tile that can track multi-course workouts. Like the Apple Watch Ultra, the Galaxy Watch Ultra brings an additional button to the watch, which Samsung calls the Quick Button. This can be programmed to initiate workouts or mapped to other functions. The display on the device can reach 3,000 nits, and there’s a Night Mode to make the display on the device easier on the eyes in the dark. Because the watch is bigger, it also has a longer battery life—up to 100 hours in power saving mode or 48 hours in Exercise Power Saving. The Galaxy Watch Ultra ships with Wear OS 5, and along with the Galaxy Watch 7, it’s the first device to get this new wearable operating system. The operating system doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it does optimize for better battery life and adds new fitness-tracking features. The device also supports a Double Pinch gesture that can control aspects of both the watch and a connected Galaxy smartphone—just like the Double Tap gesture on the Apple Watch. The Galaxy Watch Ultra starts at $650 and is now up for preorder, with availability beginning on July 24. Samsung Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 Samsung’s Most Popular Smartwatch Gets A Little Sleeker While Samsung launched the Galaxy Watch Ultra, it also upgraded its most popular smartwatch, unveiling the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7. The 7th-generation Samsung smartwatch got a few notable upgrades that are especially nice for those who don’t want the bulkier watch or the price tag associated with the Watch Ultra. The Galaxy Watch 7 is still available in two sizes—40mm and 44mm—and it’s still available in non-cellular or cellular models. It keeps the same overall design as the Galaxy Watch 6, which is expected given the fact that on that device, Samsung shrunk down the bezels for a sleeker look. Depending on the size you select, the watch has either a 1.3 or 1.6-inch display. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 keeps the same build as the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6. Christian de Looper for Forbes There are some new health tracking features, too, including the new FDA-authorized (not yet FDA-approved) sleep apnea tracking. There’s also a new dual-frequency GPS, which should make for much more accurate location-tracking. Two other features coming to both watches are an Energy Score and AI-based Wellness Tips. The Energy Score compiles your health metrics and your Sleep Score using sleep and activity metrics to make recommendations around daily activity. Wellness Tips takes all your health tracking data and provides you with ideas to improve your overall health. The device also supports the same Double Pinch gesture as the Galaxy Watch Ultra. The 40mm updated Samsung smartwatch comes in Green and Cream, while the 44mm model comes in Green and Silver. The Galaxy Watch 7 starts at $300 for the Wi-Fi model and is available for preorder, with full availability starting on July 24. Samsung Samsung Galaxy Ring The New Galaxy Ring Brings Health Tracking Right To Your Finger After teasing the device earlier in the year at January’s Samsung Unpacked, the Samsung Galaxy Ring is finally here. Built to tightly integrate into the Samsung ecosystem, it offers solid fitness-tracking features in a small device that’s less intrusive than any of the Galaxy Watch models. That said, the Galaxy Ring doesn’t necessarily offer more fitness-tracking features than the Galaxy Watch, so if you get a Galaxy Watch and don’t mind wearing it at night, it’s perhaps not worth also buying the Galaxy Ring. The Galaxy Ring is available in nine ring sizes and three finishes —Titanium Black, Titanium Silver and Titanium Gold. The Samsung Galaxy Ring is (finally) here and available for preorder. Christian de Looper for Forbes The device syncs with the Samsung Health app, and Samsung is quick to point out that users don’t need a subscription to access advanced health metrics, unlike with the Oura Ring (Gen 3). Through the Samsung Health app, users can access basic sleep tracking along with more advanced sleep metrics, like movement during sleep, sleep latency, respiratory rate and more. The ring also supports menstrual cycle tracking, and it offers the same Energy Score to make daily activity recommendations. The Ring integrates with other Samsung devices, too. Like the Galaxy Watches, the Ring supports a Double Pinch gesture that can take a photo or dismiss an alarm on your phone. The Samsung Galaxy Ring is available for preorder and costs $400, and shipping begins July 24. Samsung Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro A New Design For the Galaxy Buds With Touch And Pinch Gestures The tech company also launched new versions of its Galaxy Buds during Samsung Unpacked: the Galaxy Buds 3 and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. The earbuds are entirely new compared to the previous-gen model. Its new design features stems for a more comfortable fit. In addition to the new pinch feature to play/pause your music, pinching and sliding your fingers along the stems can adjust volume—and every swipe and pinch is customizable, too. The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro now feature stems on each earbud. Christian de Looper for Forbes The new earbuds are built to be smarter than previous-gen models. They have three well-placed microphones to better catch your voice as well as analyze surrounding noise for improved noise cancellation. If you have the Buds 3 Pro, you’ll get enhanced Voice Detect and adaptive noise control, too, for when you’re speaking or when emergency sirens pass nearby. Samsung also added AI features to the earbuds. The earbuds now offer an Interpreter feature that can translate audio in a foreign language in real time. Users can also use voice commands to play or pause audio without touching the earbuds. The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 also have a new stem but come at a lower price. Christian de Looper for Forbes The biggest difference between the Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro is the fact that the Buds 3 Pro are in-canal earbuds, while the standard Galaxy Buds 3 are more open. So, the Buds 3 let in outside noise. They don’t create a seal in your ear canal while the Buds 3 Pro can create that seal for better isolation. Additionally, the Buds 3 Pro offer better drivers that will likely deliver an improved audio quality. While the standard Buds 3 have 11mm dynamic drivers, the Buds 3 Pro offer dual drivers, with one 10.5mm dynamic driver and one 6.1mm planar magnetic driver. Also, the standard Buds 3 don’t have adaptive noise control, Voice Detect or Ambient Sound. The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 cost $180, and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro cost $250. Both come in silver or white and are available for preorder now with full availability on July 24. Follow me on Twitter.

                    "text": "This year's Samsung Galaxy Unpacked continues the trend of big tech's current obsession: artificial intelligence. Samsung's 2024 iteration of Unpacked saw the South Korea-based tech giant introducing a slew of neat, albeit superficial, AI additions to the Galaxy ecosystem and its lineup of phones, rings, and things. So to save you some time, here are five of the most interesting Galaxy AI features that were announced at Unpacked 2024: Portrait Studio Sydney Sweeney made a surprise appearance to help Samsung show off Portrait Studio — a feature that makes AI-powered avatars from your selfies. This one might need some more time in the oven, but the idea is to add a fun way to spice up your selfies. It's not new in the world of generative AI, but the ability to do so on Samsung devices is meant to add convenience to users who are feeling a little creative. Simply upload a photo from your gallery and explore a variety of styles by clicking the pencil icon. Choose from options like comic, 3D character, watercolor, and sketch to personalize your selfies effortlessly. Photo Ambient The new Galaxy Z Flip 6 offers a variety of customization options, including the AI-powered Photo Ambient feature. This feature allows your wallpaper to change in real time based on the time and weather. It ensures that your device's appearance is always dynamic and relevant to your environment. In addition to real-time wallpaper changes, Photo Ambient helps create a cohesive look for your device. It analyzes your wallpaper and suggests screen layout options, such as moving the clock and adjusting frame colors. This ensures that the background image remains prominent while your device maintains a unified aesthetic. Interpreter First introduced on the Galaxy S24, Galaxy AI's Interpreter feature is now optimized for foldables like the Galaxy Z Flip 6. In FlexMode, you can have real-time conversations with translations displayed on both the Cover Screen and Main Screen. In Conversation Mode, each person's language is shown on the screen visible to them, making face-to-face communication smoother. Additionally, there's also a listening mode for when you're attending foreign language lectures or traveling abroad. This is meant to be paired with Galaxy Buds 3 for simultaneous audio translation, which can translate what you hear into text in real-time. Energy Score Energy Score, found on the likes of Samsung Galaxy Ring and Galaxy Watch Ultra, provides a clear picture of how your health impacts your daily life. Generated by Galaxy AI, this score evaluates your sleep, activity, sleeping heart rate, and heart rate variability. With these insights, you can focus on specific areas to improve your overall well-being. Wellness Tips Joining Energy Score is a new feature called Wellness Tips, which is driven by comprehensive data and individual interests. These tips cover various aspects of health, including sleep, exercise, and stress management, helping you make informed decisions to support your wellness journey.",

                    "title": "Everything Announced at Galaxy Unpacked 2024: Watches, Foldables, and the One Ring to Rule Them All",
                    "text": "The Samsung Galaxy Unpacked product showcase took quite a bit of unloading. There’s a new slate of Galaxy foldables, a Galaxy Watch Ultra, and improved Galaxy Buds. But of all that’s been announced Wednesday, the most striking and memorable announcement for any The Lord of the Rings fan is the long-awaited $399 Galaxy Ring that comes in gold (And in the darkness, bind them). Everything’s coming out on July 24, with preorders starting today. Samsung’s latest offering seems perfectly poised to take on Apple during Galaxy Unpacked, especially with the new $179 Galaxy Buds and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro that sport a stick design similar to your AirPods Pro. While we’re finally looking at the new and improved Galaxy Watch 7 with its remodeled health sensor array, the more intriguing item is the Galaxy Watch Ultra. It’s a rugged watch with a programmable action button akin to the Apple Watch Ultra 2. It wouldn’t be Galaxy Unpacked without foldables, and so, as expected, we’ve received our first look at the $1,899 Galaxy Z Fold 6 and $1,099 Z Flip 6. The two devices may look very familiar to those who’ve spent time with the Flip 5 and Fold 5, but there are a few key differences, including a more squared shell on the Z Fold 6. However, that all comes at a cost, as now both devices cost $100 more than previous phones from last year. There’s more pressure on foldables now that players like Motorola, OnePlus, and even Google have entered the U.S. market with cheaper products than Samsung’s latest. We’ll have to see if any touted Galaxy AI can keep the foldable market in the Korean tech giant’s large orbit. Galaxy Unpacked: The Galaxy Z Fold 6 Is Samsung’s Lightest Foldable Yet The big flagship foldable, routinely cited as one of the best phablet foldables, has returned with better processing power and a changed 7.6-inch AMOLED interior screen. The new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 comes at an increased cost, starting at $1,900 for 256 GB of storage—$100 more than the Z Fold 5. Instead of trying something closer to the standard phone size when shut, the Fold 6 still has a compact form, though now its once-rounded corners have been squared off. Samsung claims this is their lightest foldable yet. While the thinner foldable displays are known for being more sensitive than your typical phone screen, Samsung said its new interior screen has been beefed up in durability. A new STF coating should also make the creaseless more noticeable than its past foldable. The bezels are also slimmed down to try and maximize screen real estate. The new Galaxy Zs house a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip that boasts better CPU and GPU capabilities and a vastly improved neural processor to handle some of the on-device AI capabilities. The interior screen’s claimed peak brightness is 2,600 nits. It also has some gaming features, like support for ray tracing. The Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 should have seven years of promised security updates. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 Has an Improved Exterior Camera The $1,099 Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 is also coming in at a higher cost, though with a design that is much, much closer to the Z Flip 5. It still maintains the 3.4-inch AMOLED FlexWindow of the previous generation, though you can access some AI features like Suggested replies from the exterior screen. The FlexWindow now works with the Galaxy AI live translate features, so your conversation partner should see your translated text while you see their translation on the interior display. It now has a 50 MP Wide main sensor and a 12 MP Ultra-wide lens on the outside, and the Galaxy Z Flip 6 promises camera capabilities equivalent to the Galaxy S24. The main sensor has a 2x optical zoom and up to 10x zoom. Nightography uses AI to enhance dark photos—the FlexCam function, when using the Flip half open, now auto zooms to center the subject in the frame. There’s also an automatic slo-mo function. A new vapor chamber keeps things cool in addition to the 4,000 mAh battery that promises a full-day battery life. With the Photo Ambient feature, you can add “live effects” to some images you use as your wallpaper. This includes darkening or lightening your image depending on the time of day or generating fake rain or snow during adverse weather. Galaxy Ring is Meant to be an Unobtrusive Fitness Tracker Perhaps the biggest announcement at Galaxy Unpacked was that the $399 Galaxy Ring is finally here. Just as expected, it’s meant to be a health and wellness tracker without all the screens. It weighs 2.3 to 3 grams and comes in nine different sizes and three colors. As mentioned, the gold color is best for those who always want the proverbial Eye of Sauron to judge their health metrics. Three sensors send your sleep, eating, and fitness metrics to the Samsung Health app, including heart rate and sleep patterns. It’s meant to be worn 24/7; the claim is that it can last up to seven days on one charge. It’s made of titanium, so the promise is it should be durable and relatively light on your fingers, plus it’s rated 10ATM water resistance for depths up to 100 meters. The Galaxy Buds 3 Take on a Real AirPods Look in New Iteration The $180 Galaxy Buds 3 are sporting a new look with a stick design reminiscent of AirPods. The Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro have adaptive EQ and ANC, but compared to the Pro, the less expensive buds only include a 1-way speaker. The case is rectangular to house the stick-like buds better. Galaxy Unpacked: Galaxy Buds 3 Pro Are Looking Very Punk Industrial in Silver Gray It’s not just a new shape making the $249 Galaxy Buds 3 Pro stand out. Samsung said it created its latest high-end buds to fit any oddly shaped ear. It should also adjust the ANC and sound experience depending on whether the buds fit snugly or loose. The Korean tech giant said these were “the best” buds they’ve ever produced regarding sheer audio quality. They contain a 2-way speaker with a dual amp that supports Hi-Fi audio. The new Buds should have twice the playback bandwidth of the Buds 2 Pro, but as always, we’ll need to test them ourselves to give any credence to the claims. The obvious comparison to the new Galaxy Buds Pro is the Apple AirPods Pro, but look beyond the stick design, and there are a few interesting design choices. For one, the main color choice is a Robocop-like steel gray marked with a blue or red stripe to designate whether the stick is made for the left or right ears. The more expensive Galaxy Buds have the in-ear silicone to hold it in place, compared to the standard sticks of the cheaper counterpart. It also comes with a clear plastic lid in case you ever get nervous your expensive buds aren’t where they’re supposed to be. Samsung’s New Galaxy Watch 7 Has an Improved Health Sensor Just like the Watch 6, the Galaxy Watch 7 is meant to be a health-tracking powerhouse. It uses a 3nm processor, promising it’s three times faster than previous watches. You can get it in 40mm and 44mm watch sizes, and both will sport different color options. Both watches include a dual-frequency GPS for accurate location tracking in cities or forests. Still, the main thrust of the Watch 7 series is the improved BioActive Sensor, which is meant to offer better health readings, monitor heart rate, and generate a “Body Composition” health report. The latest watches and the newly redesigned health sensor are among the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved watches to detect sleep apnea. All the new watches are running on WearOS 5. Galaxy Unpacked: A New Galaxy Watch Ultra is As Enticing as it Is Expensive The $649 Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra takes much of what’s good about the Watch 7 but expands it with better durability and water resistance that can take up to 100 meters underwater. It features a multi-sports tile for those training for triathlons, and an Action Button-like “Quick Button” can be programmed to initiate or control workouts immediately. The watch face is circular like the other Galaxy watches but also includes a square Titanium cushion frame for durability. The Watch Ultra uses a “personalized FTP” that takes four minutes of cycling time compared to some of its earlier watches. It requires a connection to your phone, but it should work with the new Samsung Health for your tracking. The more expensive watch is also supposed to offer 100 hours of battery life in power saving mode and 48 hours in “exercise power saving” mode. Galaxy Unpacked: Galaxy AI and Google AI Both Stream onto Samsung’s Foldables Circle to Search is coming to Samsung’s foldables, including recent additions like translating and math/physics homework help. The company promised it would also soon be able to solve symbolic math problems in the near future. Samsung’s own Galaxy AI is a separate slate of AI capabilities. The first is Note Assist, which brings a few AI capabilities to the Samsung Notes app. It enables translation and transcription services that also let you summarize the recording. The Composer feature is an AI chatbot that generates text based on prompts. Finally, Smart Select gives S Pen users quick access to the AI translation features. Sketch to Image and Photo Assist The latest foldable phones have even more AI abilities in store. The Sketch to Image ability lets users draw on top of their photos, and with a button, the phone should try its best to generate a more realistic object in the image using AI. It’s a feature akin to Microsoft’s Copilot+ Cocreate feature in Paint. There’s also Photo Assist to enhance some aspects of photos, like brightness. Another AI feature that is probably less helpful is the Portrait Studio, which takes a picture and creates an AI-generated mockup of the subject in the image. Samsung used the feature on actor Sydney Sweeney, with some rather odd, plastic-looking results.",

                    "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Samsung debuted its all-new foldable lineup, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 and the Galaxy Z Fold 6, this week in Paris, France. Foldables are nothing new to the technology giant, having launched the Flip 5 and Fold 5 last year in Korea. But with these new models come solid enhancements that have the potential to make the devices better than before. So, I went hands-on to the Samsung Unpacked event to check them out. The all-new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6 are out, but how do they stack up? Read on for the ... [+] hands-on take for both devices. Illustration: Forbes: / Photo: Retailer While Samsung had some clever tricks up its sleeve for one device, there’s another in particular that truly left me wowed. Read on to hear my initial takes on the Flip 6 and Fold 6, and whether they’re worth pre-ordering right now. MORE FROMFORBES VETTED The Uppababy Vista V2 Is $250 Off During The Nordstrom Anniversary Sale By Jordan Thomas Forbes Staff Here’s Everything You Need To Know About Prime Day Invite-Only Deals By Jordan Thomas Forbes Staff Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 Major Feature Improvements Samsung Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 The first feature I noticed about the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 was the brushed, shiny new frame. Earlier this year, Samsung launched the new Samsung S24 Ultra, which features a titanium frame and back panel for extra durability. The Flip 6 also doesn’t implement this sturdy component alongside the new dual rail hinge, but the aluminum frame still feels sturdy when opening and closing and in my hand. I was able to preview the Flip 6 in the mint color, and although I would have liked to see the back plate match the frame, it still looks pretty polished and spiffy. The new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 has a fun colorful design with a brushed titanium frame. Rebecca Isaacs for Forbes The foldable screen also caught my eye, as it looks notably smoother compared to the Flip 5. I ran my fingers along where the crease should have been and I didn’t feel it. I’m excited to start testing streaming on this device to see if the crease shows more with use, but for now, it’s barely noticeable from any angle, and that’s a huge improvement. The cameras also get some new and different design flair. Rebecca Isaacs for Forbes The customization software on the Flip 6 for your backgrounds and images received some major overhauls, too. Samsung read my mind in that I wanted to pare down and customize my widgets on this display—because now I can. During my hands-on, the resizable widgets allowed me to see the weather, my health tracking stats and more on this small screen. Or, I could add a quick shortcut to use the calculator. I’ve always enjoyed this handy cover screen as it’s easy to answer messages or get at-a-glance information, and this feels like a nice way to upgrade something that I already find essential. The new widget screen on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 feels like a major upgrade. Rebecca Isaacs for Forbes But by far, its most valuable improvement is the camera. The Flip 5 has a 12MP wide, 12MP ultrawide and a 10MP selfie camera set. The Flip 6 finally gets a new 50MP wide, 12MP ultrawide and a 12MP telephoto lens. I snapped some test photos with the device and saw improvement compared to my Flip 5 camera—the test subjects looked clearer and more detailed when I zoomed in. (You’ll have to take my word for it, as I wasn’t allowed to remove any images taken with the device for security reasons.) I wasn’t yet able to test some other features, such as Samsung’s signature Nightography, but I plan to further explore this later once I have the device for a longer period of time. For those questioning whether it’s worth the pre-order, even with its increased $100 price tag—it absolutely is. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Still Resting On Its Laurels Samsung Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 While it appears Samsung went all-out with the Flip 6, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 has a more nuanced approach. Samsung slightly rejiggered its size, so it’s slightly wider and shorter. But, most notably, it lost some weight, reducing the grams from 252.8 to just 239 grams. It may not seem like much of a difference, but, if you’re gaming or note-taking with the S Pen (which is still sold separately in the S Pen case), those extra grams can start feeling hefty. The new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 has small design changes. Rebecca Isaacs for Forbes It’s a smart choice. One of my biggest complaints about the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 is that it’s just plain heavy. And this complaint isn’t limited to the original Samsung Fold series, either. Google’s first foray into the foldable market, the Google Fold, feels like I’m carrying bricks with its 282 grams. The OnePlus Open is the only exception, weighing in at 238 grams, but its camera juts out too much for my personal taste. For Samsung to focus on increasing the screen size while reducing the weight feels like a great decision. I didn’t have a Fold 5 on hand to compare the two, but the Fold 6 felt light in my hand when folded and unfolded. I could see myself carrying this device around New York City, especially in that new Barbie pink color. Although, the crease, unlike on the Flip 6, is still visible on the Fold 6. Samsung markets this as a productivity and gaming tool, but it added some fun AI elements. I saw a demonstration of and also tried one of its latest features, Sketch To Image. It’s a simple premise: You shoot a photo, then doodle or scribble on it. The Fold 6 then uses AI to transform your doodles and turn them all into a cohesive image. It can be an image from scratch or you can take a photograph or other image and create something new with it. Sketch To Image spat out this AI image of a smiley face at me. Note the clearly visible crease on ... [+] the screen, too. Rebecca Isaacs for Forbes I attempted to draw two things: A cat, and the logo from Blink 182’s untitled album. It had mixed results; AI couldn’t recognize my poor rendition of my furry friend, but the smiley face produced some fun pop art renderings. I could see this being used as a great way to incite creativity when brainstorming. Samsung also buddied up closer to Google to implement more of Gemini. I can use an Interpreter feature to translate other languages in real-time; I can automatically translate any web page in the browser and more, all thanks to this partnership. It’s all great, but a lot of this software is already on my Samsung S24 Ultra. And again, while I don’t have the Fold 5 on me to check, I suspect some of this it’s also already on this older sibling, too. And if it isn’t for some reason, I also suspect it will get these upgrades later on. Under the hood, it has an improved vapor chamber for gaming and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor—the same one currently available in the Samsung S24 Ultra. I can’t speak to this fully quite yet, as further testing is needed for heavier applications, but the device felt responsive and smooth when jumping between apps and separating the multi-tasking window. The Fold 6 has a slightly wider footprint compared to its predecessor, but it's unnoticeable when ... [+] folded. Rebecca Isaacs for Forbes But is it worth the $1,900? In my opinion, yes—but it’s a complicated yes. Sure, Sketch To Image is fun to play with. And it is lighter to carry, but, as my colleague Adam Doud mentioned in his review of the Fold 5, Samsung felt like it was resting on its laurels last year. This year, the upgrades feel so incremental, it almost feels like the same device. Samsung needed to make bolder choices here to keep standing out from its competitors—and it didn’t. But for those who want a book-style foldable phone, this ticks most boxes, and even with just these minor upgrades, it’s still worth the preorder. It’s also the only foldable to date that supports any kind of stylus, which makes it a must-have if you’re wanting essentially a two-in-one tablet. Personally, if I had $1,900 lying around, this would still be my top choice for a book-style foldable phone. Send me a secure tip. Rebecca Isaacs Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions",

                    "text": "Strands doesn't get as much attention as its New York Times game siblings Wordle and Connections, but it can be just as challenging and entertaining. Strands just moved out of beta, so it's now in the New York Times' official Games app, which might bring it more fans. I go into depth about the rules for Strands in this story. If you're reading this, you probably need some help with the Strands puzzle, so here we go. Warning: Scroll down too far and too fast and you'll see spoilers. Need more answers? Here's the answer for today's Wordle, and here are the answers for today's Connections. Read more: NYT Connections Turns 1: These Are the 5 Toughest Puzzles So Far Hint for today's Strands puzzle Today's Strands theme is: In Neverland. But if that doesn't help you, here's a clue: Second star to the right, and straight on 'til morning. Clue words to unlock in-game hints Your goal is to find hidden words that fit the puzzle's theme. If you're stuck, find any words you can. Every time you find three words of four letters or more, Strands will reveal one of the theme words. These are the words I used to get those hints, but any words of four or more letters that you find will work: DARN, TACT, ACTS, CAST, STRIDE, RIDE, PERM, DERM, MADE, PLATE, PLAT, LATE, MAID. Answers for today's Strands puzzle These are the answers that tie in to the theme. The goal of the puzzle is to find them all, including the spangram, a theme word that reaches from one side of the puzzle to the other. When you've got all of them (I originally thought there were always eight but learned that the number can vary), every letter on the board will be used. Here are the nonspangram answers: DARLING, HOOK, LAGOON, PIRATES, MERMAID, CROCODILE. Today's Strands spangram Today's Strands spangram is PETERPAN. To spell it out, start with the P that's three letters down on the far right, and wind over to the far left. How to play NYT Strands 1. Use today's theme to look for words relating to that topic. See one? Drag or click the letters in order. Click on the last letter twice to submit your guess. If you've found a theme word, it'll light up in blue and stay that way. 2. Other words you find are considered hint words that give you clues to the theme words. Find three hint words (they must have at least four letters each), and the game will reward you by showing you a theme word. But if you can't unscramble it, find three more hint words and the game will highlight the theme word's letters in order. 3. Hunt for the spangram, a special theme word that spans the entire puzzle, though it could flow across, or top to bottom. It summarizes the puzzle theme. 4. When you're done, you'll have used every letter on the board in either a theme word or spangram. Theme words fill the entire board and do not overlap.",

Instructions on how to play the game are below. Clues and the answers for Wednesday's puzzle are toward the end of the article, so scroll with caution.How to Play ConnectionsConnections tasks players with grouping 16 words into four categories based on association. For example, Wednesday's game linked the words mane, mop, shock and tangle under the category Mess of Hair.Each of the four categories is labeled with a color, which also signifies their difficulty level. Yellow is the easiest category, followed by green, blue and purple. However, the puzzles are rarely straightforward. They use homophones and wordplay, among other techniques, to keep players challenged.Sometimes a red herring is thrown in to confuse people. This happens when a word can belong to more than one category but there is only one correct answer. If stuck, people can hit the shuffle button, which will mix up where the words appear on the screen.Wyna Liu is a puzzle editor at the Times who was asked to develop Connections. During a conversation with Newsweek, she shared her tips for playing.\"My best piece of advice is to wait as long as you can before guessing,\" Liu said.\"You may see the board and have completely identified the category, seeing five words that could belong in that category,\" she continued. \"Don't try to guess the four words in that category because even though you know what the fifth member is, you won't know which of the four it might not be,\" which would ultimately waste a turn.\"She added: \"Don't do what I do, which is 'rage solve.'\"Connections #395 Clues for WednesdayNewsweek has some hints to help you figure out Wednesday's Connections categories.Yellow: These answers all deal with probability.Green: These words often describe behavior exhibited by rude people.Blue: Think of an animal that swims in water.Purple: These are words that make up a pair of spectacles.Connections #395 Answers for WednesdayYellow category: Future LikelihoodYellow words: chance, forecast, outlook, prospectGreen category: Back TalkGreen words: attitude, cheek, lip, sassBlue category: FishBlue words: bass, fluke, perch, pikePurple category: Components of EyeglassesPurple words: bridge, lens, rim, templeDid you guess the answers correctly?

You can find them here: ForbesToday's NYT 'Connections' Hints And Answers For Wednesday, July 10By Happy Thursday, everyone! I hope you’ve been having an excellent week. I’m settled back into my place after a few weeks away visiting family. I’m starting to work on healthier habits too, such as getting out of bed at a reasonable time instead of 15 minutes before I start work, and deleting apps from my phone that tend to bring me down (especially Twitter). Anyway, today’s NYT Connections hints and answers are coming right up. How To Play Connections In Connections, you’re presented with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to arrange them into four groups of four by figuring out the links between them. The groups could be things like horror movie franchises, a type of verb or rappers. There’s only one solution for each puzzle, and you’ll need to be careful when it comes to words that might fit into more than one category. You can shuffle the words to perhaps help you see links between them. MORE FOR YOU Northern Lights Alert: Beware ‘Head-On’ Aurora Displays, Scientists Say NYT ‘Strands’ Hints, Spangram And Answers For Wednesday, July 10th Microsoft Windows Deadline—You Have 21 Days To Update Your PC Each group is color coded. The yellow group is usually the easiest to figure out, blue and green fall in the middle, and the purple group is typically the hardest one to deduce. The purple group often involves wordplay, so bear that in mind. Select four words you think go together and press Submit. If you make a guess and you’re incorrect, you’ll lose a life. If you’re close to having a correct group, you might see a message telling you that you’re one word away from getting it right, but you’ll still need to figure out which one to swap. If you make four mistakes, it’s game over. Let’s make sure that doesn’t happen with the help of some hints, and, if you’re really struggling, today’s Connections answers. What Are Today’s Connections Hints? Scroll slowly! Just after the hints for each of today’s Connections groups, I’ll reveal what the groups are without immediately telling you which words go into them. Today’s 16 words are... TAPE RECORDING HAND SEND APPLAUSE KEY PASS PRINCIPAL RULER WALK STAPLE PEN ESSENTIAL SCISSORS GIVE EXIT And the hints for today’s groups are: Yellow group — classroom necessities Green group — foundational Blue group — exchange Purple group — illuminated instructions What Are Today’s Connections Groups? Need some extra help? Be warned: we’re starting to get into spoiler territory. Today’s groups are... Yellow group — school supplies Green group — fundamental Blue group — transfer Purple group — light-up signs What Are Today’s Connections Answers? Spoiler alert! Don’t scroll any further down the page until you’re ready to find out today’s Connections answers. This is your final warning! Today’s Connections answers are... Yellow group — school supplies (PEN, RULER, SCISSORS, TAPE) Green group — fundamental (ESSENTIAL, KEY, PRINCIPAL, STAPLE) Blue group — transfer (GIVE, HAND, PASS, SEND) Purple group — light-up signs (APPLAUSE, EXIT, RECORDING, WALK) No perfect game today, but my overall win streak now stands at four. Just like I did yesterday, I zipped through today’s game, but an error tripped me up right out of the gate. I included STAPLE with the yellows at first instead of the exceedingly more obvious PEN. Bah. Mistake corrected, I locked down that group, swiftly followed by the greens. Seeing APPLAUSE and RECORDING next to each other made me think of the signs at a TV taping, even though I’ve never been to one. The remaining purples then jumped out at me, leaving the blues for the win. That’s all there is to it for today’s Connections clues and answers. Be sure to check my blog for hints and the solution for Friday’s game if you need them. P.S. Speaking of the blues led to this terrific song popping into my head. A lot of my song recommendations are off the cuff, in case you couldn't tell. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out some of my other work here.

Anyway, after puzzling over it for a while I focused on the FUNDAMENTAL connection, picking ESSENTIAL, KEY, PRINCIPAL and STAPLE.

Not that it was a cake walk in Quordle, although at least here I had a few extra guesses in which to identify it. Plus, with repeated Ls in ALLOY and a slightly uncommon (and unusually spelled) word in ANVIL, it's a reasonably tough Quordle all round. I needed eight guesses to solve it, and that was despite my three start words giving me a good opening to the game, with four letters already uncovered for three of the quadrants. The Daily Sequence was a tricky one, too, making this a real head-scratcher of a day in Quordle. How did you do today? Send me an email and let me know.

                    "text": "Microsoft has relinquished its seat on the board of OpenAI, saying its participation is no longer needed because the ChatGPT maker has improved its governance since being roiled by boardroom chaos last year. In a Tuesday letter, Microsoft confirmed it was resigning, “effective immediately,” from its role as an observer on the artificial intelligence company’s board. “We appreciate the support shown by OpenAI leadership and the OpenAI board as we made this decision,” the letter said. The surprise departure comes amid intensifying scrutiny from antitrust regulators of the powerful AI partnership. Microsoft has reportedly invested $13 billion in OpenAI. European Union regulators said last month that they would take a fresh look at the partnership under the 27-nation bloc’s antitrust rules while British competition watchdogs have also been looking into the deal. Microsoft took the board seat following a power struggle in which OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was fired, then quickly reinstated, while the board members behind the ouster were pushed out. “Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company’s direction,” Microsoft said in its letter. “Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.” With Microsoft’s departure, OpenAI will no longer have observer seats on its board. “We are grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the Board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership,” OpenAI said in a statement. It’s not hard to conclude that Microsoft’s decision to ditch the board seat was heavily influenced by rising scrutiny of big technology companies and their links with AI startups, said Alex Haffner, a competition partner at U.K. law firm Fladgate. “It is clear that regulators are very much focused on the complex web of inter-relationships that Big Tech has created with AI providers, hence the need for Microsoft and others to carefully consider how they structure these arrangements going forward,” he said. OpenAI said it would take a new approach to “informing and engaging key strategic partners” such as Microsoft and Apple and investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, with regular meetings to update stakeholders on progress and ensure stronger collaboration on safety and security.",

                    "text": "Microsoft has ditched plans to take up a non-voting position on the board of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, according to a letter seen by AFP on Wednesday, as regulators step up scrutiny of deals involving AI companies.Microsoft's $13-billion tie-up with OpenAI has raised concerns on both sides of the Atlantic about just how much influence the tech giant has over its smaller partner.Its early investment in OpenAI has made Microsoft a market leader in AI. When ChatGPT hit the scene in November 2022, it marked the popular arrival of the AI revolution as the chatbot dazzled users with its ability to churn out eloquent text in seconds.But regulators began examining the partnership after a failed boardroom coup last year against OpenAI CEO Sam Altman -- whom Microsoft supported and even briefly hired.After the turmoil in OpenAI, Microsoft got a seat on the board as a non-voting observer that it is now giving up.Microsoft's withdrawal is \"effective immediately\", according to a letter sent from the company to OpenAI on Tuesday.\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction,\" the letter stated.\"We no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.\"The EU last month concluded after a preliminary examination that Microsoft's investment did not mean it had taken control of OpenAI.Brussels is however now seeking more information from Microsoft about the agreement with OpenAI to understand whether \"certain exclusivity clauses\" could harm competition.Microsoft is also under examination over its ties to OpenAI by British competition regulators, and faced a potential antitrust probe in the United States.\"It is hard not to conclude that Microsoft's decision has been heavily influenced by the ongoing competition/antitrust scrutiny,\" said Alex Haffner, a competition lawyer, at Fladgate law firm.Media reports said Apple had similarly given up the chance to sit on OpenAI's board, but the iPhone maker was not immediately available for comment.Apple had been due to get a seat after partnering with OpenAI for a suite of new AI features on its popular devices -- rolling out soon in markets outside the EU.The bloc's competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, has put big tech on alert over investments in the fast-growing AI market and insisted that the EU continues to keep an eye over the sector.With regulators focused on \"the complex web of inter-relationships that big tech has created with AI providers\", lawyer Haffner said there was a \"need for Microsoft and others to carefully consider how they structure these arrangements going forward\".Another phenomenon in the AI market in the EU's crosshairs is so-called \"acqui-hires\" -- when a company acquires another firm mainly to grab its key talent -- with Brussels racing to understand if it distorts competition. Microsoft earlier this year announced a deal to hire senior figures from OpenAI rival Inflection, including its boss, to head up a newly created consumer AI unit. But unlike a merger, Inflection still operates as an independent company and such a move by Microsoft means it avoids a traditional merger probe.Regulators have the right to block mergers if there are fears of damage to competition.",

                    "text": "Microsoft has reportedly dropped its seat as an observer on OpenAI’s board of directors, less than eight months after it secured the post. The Washington-based tech giant got its non-voting OpenAI board seat in November of 2023 after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was rehired following his short-lived forceful removal. Microsoft, which has invested more than $10 billion in the firm behind artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, was “blindsided” by Altman’s sudden firing last year. “Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company’s direction,” Keith Dolliver, Microsoft’s deputy general counsel, wrote in a letter to OpenAI Tuesday, according to The Financial Times and Axios. “Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,” Microsoft added in the letter as it announced its withdrawal of the seat “effective immediately.” Apple, which recently got its own observer seat on OpenAI’s board, has declined to accept the post, The Times reports. Phil Schiller, who leads Apple’s App Store, was expected to fill the seat later this year. The two firms have announced a partnership to integrate ChatGPT 4-o into the latest iPhone operating system (iOS 18), iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. OpenAI’s new approach to keeping its partners, including the tech giants and investors like Thrive Capital, in the loop will be regular meetings, according to the Times. The changes to OpenAI’s board come as European and U.S. regulators have opened investigations into big tech companies over antitrust concerns. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have reached a deal to investigate Microsoft, Nvidia, and Open AI over potentially anti-competitive behavior in the AI space. The FTC is separately probing Microsoft over a deal to “acqui-hire” AI startup Inflection, as well as Amazon and Google’s separate investments into Anthropic. The United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority in December began gathering information to determine whether Microsoft and OpenAI’s collaboration threatens competition. And the European Commission is weighing its own possible antitrust investigation into the tie-up. Representatives for Microsoft, OpenAI, and Apple did not immediately return requests for comment.

                    "text": "Microsoft and Apple have reportedly dropped their plans to hold observer seats on OpenAI’s board of directors – a move that comes as the Big Tech firms face a widening antitrust crackdown in the US and Europe. Microsoft, which has committed $13 billion toward CEO Sam Altman’s ChatGPT maker, informed OpenAI in a letter late Tuesday that it would give up its non-voting board seat effective immediately, the Financial Times reported. Satya Nadella-led Microsoft was set to join OpenAI’s board after an internal coup to oust Altman sparked chaos at the AI firm last fall. Nadella reportedly played a key role in talks that eventually led Altman to return to his post as part of a total overhaul of the board. “Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company’s direction,” Microsoft wrote in the memo, according to Bloomberg. “We no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.” Additionally, Apple – which was set to hold an observer seat after inking a deal to bring ChatGPT features to its most powerful iPhones later this year – will not move forward with the plan, the outlet reported, citing a source with direct knowledge of the matter. As recently as last week, Apple’s App Store chief Phil Schiller had been expected to fill the seat, according to Bloomberg. OpenAI said in a statement that it is “grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership.” The Post reached out to all three firms for further comment. Antitrust officials in the US and Europe have expressed concerns about the close ties between OpenAI and Microsoft – which did not receive an equity stake as part of its investment but gets a cut of its profits. In June, reports surfaced that the Federal Trade Commission would spearhead an antitrust inquiry into Microsoft and OpenAI, while the Justice Department would probe AI chip supplier Nvidia. The agency had already announced a probe into partnerships between Big Tech firms and AI startups, such as the Microsoft-OpenAI tie-up and investments by Google and Amazon into Anthropic. Last month, the European Commission, the European Union’s antitrust watchdog, said it was prepping an investigation into the deal and whether it hurts competition. Meanwhile, the Justice Department slapped Apple with a landmark antitrust lawsuit alleging it has taken illegal steps to ensure the dominance of its iPhone within the smartphone market.

                    "title": "Microsoft and Apple Withdraw from OpenAI&#8217;s Board as Antitrust Scrutiny Heats Up",
                    "text": "As regulators across the U.S. and Europe continue to crack down on corporate partnerships in the buzzing A.I. world, both Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) are abandoning their board seats at OpenAI. Microsoft executive Dee Templeton has been a non-voting board member of OpenAI since the beginning of the year, while Apple executive Phil Schiller was reportedly set to join as a non-voting observer later in 2024. Microsoft yesterday (July 9) told OpenAI that the withdrawal will take place “effective immediately,” as first reported by the Financial Times, which also noted that Apple has decided to decline its board offer. In order to continue to keep its partners informed on the organization’s inner workings, OpenAI will instead begin hosting regular meetings with the two companies. Microsoft is OpenAI’s largest investor, having funneled some $13 billion into the company. Their partnership, which began five years ago, integrates OpenAI’s A.I. technology into Microsoft products and sees Microsoft provide computing power for OpenAI. Despite Microsoft’s major investment, OpenAI maintains that it “remains an entirely independent company.” It currently operates as a nonprofit that runs a capped-profit subsidiary from which Microsoft is entitled to receive a percentage of profit—although OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is reportedly looking to restructure the entire organization into a fully for-profit model. In November, Microsoft was shocked when Altman was briefly ousted by OpenAI’s board. Shortly after Altman was reinstated as CEO and a new board was formed, it received a non-voting observer board role to remain better informed on the company’s decision-making. But in yesterday’s letter to OpenAI, written by Microsoft’s deputy general counsel Keith Dolliver, the company said that although the position “provided insights into the board’s activities without compromising its independence,” the role was no longer “necessary” and reiterated its confidence in OpenAI’s direction, according to the Financial Times. Why the change of heart? The withdrawal comes amid heightened scrutiny around Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI, which has boosted the Big Tech company’s profits and market cap. The European Commission, which previously dropped a review into whether the entanglement broke European Union merger rules, is currently weighing whether the two companies warrant an antitrust examination; while the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority is reviewing whether the partnership has resulted in “an acquisition of control.” The Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., too, is currently examining whether OpenAI and Microsoft have violated antitrust laws. While Apple might not yet be facing the same levels of scrutiny when it comes to A.I. regulation, it recently formalized its ties with OpenAI with a partnership that will see the latest version of ChatGPT integrated across Apple devices. While it was revealed earlier this month that Apple’s Schiller would join OpenAI’s board to further strengthen the relationship between the two companies, Apple has since decided to back out. With both Microsoft and Apple no longer privy to board meetings, OpenAI going forward will pursue a different method to keep its key partners informed. Microsoft and Apple, in addition to OpenAI investors like Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, will now participate in meetings with the company. “Moving forward, we will host regular stakeholder meetings to share progress on our mission and ensure stronger collaboration across safety and security,” said an OpenAI spokesperson in a statement to the Guardian. “We look forward to continuing to receive feedback and advice from these key stakeholders.”",

                    "text": "House Speaker emerita Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) remained noncommittal in a Wednesday interview on President Biden’s candidacy, saying that “time is running short” on finding a replacement Democratic nominee. “It’s up to the president to decide if he is going to run,” Pelosi said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” after having praised the 81-year-old president’s “spectacular” performance during his speech at the NATO summit in Washington, D.C. “We’re all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short,” she added. “It’s not for me to say, I’m not the head of the caucus anymore, but he’s beloved, he is respected, and people want him to make that decision.” Biden already sent a stern letter to lawmakers on Monday morning that left no doubt he was “firmly committed” to staying in the 2024 race. When MSNBC co-host Jonathan Lemire pointed this out to Pelosi, the former House speaker responded: “I want him to do whatever he decides to do.” “Whatever he decides, we go with,” she said before pivoting, “And I’ve said to everyone, let’s just hold off whatever you’re thinking. Either tell somebody privately, but you don’t have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week. But I’m very proud of the president.” House Democrats huddled in a closed-door caucus meeting on Tuesday morning at Democratic National Committee headquarters to discuss their party leader’s future, with senior lawmakers re-emerging hours later to back Biden. Only seven Democratic members of Congress have come out against the oldest-ever president, urging their party to reconsider before a potentially disastrous electoral outcome up and down the ballot in November.",

She spoke on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Biden's favorite cable news show and the same venue where on Monday he gave one of his most defiant declarations that he would remain in the race. Pelosi, a San Francisco Democrat, is no longer in Democratic leadership but remains in the House after one of the most consequential tenures in history. At 84, she is three years older than Biden and served alongside him for most of his political career. She also had the experience of watching close friend Sen. Dianne Feinstein deteriorate before dying in office last year. Pelosi said Biden would have the \"overwhelming support\" of House Democrats. \"He's beloved, he is respected, and people want him to make that decision.\" She also suggested that she would not make a more direct call for him to withdraw. “I’ve said to everyone, let’s just hold off, whatever you’re thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don’t have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week,” she said.",

Biden told Stephanopoulos, \"Well, it's, like, they're not gonna do that.\" Schumer on Tuesday simply told reporters multiple times, \"I'm with Joe\" -- but declined to engage in broader questions on Biden's path forward. Jeffries, who earlier this week said he still supported Biden and that his position remained unchanged, huddled behind closed doors on Tuesday with House Democrats to discuss Biden's path forward. Some members described the meeting as \"rough\" and sobering, according to multiple participants. Others described feeling powerless to change course amid Biden's defiance.

Jim Clyburn, expressed support for Biden. \"Right now, President Biden is the nominee. We support the Democratic nominee,\" Rep. Pete Aguilar, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said at a press conference. Senate Democrats also met for their own conference meeting on Tuesday. Sen. Michael Bennet, during an interview with CNN, said in the meeting he expressed to colleagues his belief that Biden will not defeat Trump this November. \"Donald Trump is on track, I think to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Bennet said. \"For me, this is not a question about polling, it's not a question about politics, it's a moral question about the future of our country and I think it's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face if together we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\" Multiple sources confirmed to ABC that Sens. Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown conveyed similar concerns about Biden's ability to win during the meeting. Brown and Tester are both facing difficult reelection campaigns of their own this cycle. The Biden campaign pushed back on Bennet's comments, saying the race was always going to be close and is \"far from over.\" ABC News' Mary Bruce contributed to this report.",

                    "text": "Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, appearing on MSNBC on Wednesday morning, declined to directly answer when asked if President Joe Biden had her support as he seeks reelection amid debate between Democrats on his viability as a candidate. \"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" Pelosi told \"Morning Joe\" co-host Jonathan Lemire. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\" \"I think overwhelming support of the caucus -- it's not for me to say, I'm not the head of the caucus anymore -- but, he's beloved, he is respected and people want him to make that decision,\" Pelosi added. Biden, in a defiant statement to congressional Democrats on Monday, has said he's \"firmly committed\" to staying in the race to the end. Lemire followed up by asking Pelosi directly, \"Do you want him to run?\" \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" Pelosi responded. \"And that is the way it is. Whatever he decides to go with.\" \"I said to everyone -- let's just hold off. Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week. But I am very proud of the president,\" Pelosi added. The Biden campaign's response to Pelosi's comments was, \"He's running.\" Pelosi led House Democrats for the first two years of the Biden administration, helping pass some of his signature policy achievements such as the bipartisan infrastructure law and gun safety legislation. As a Democratic leader who has worked closely with Biden, Pelosi's thoughts on the president's ability to hold the office could carry a lot of weight in an election year where Biden's rematch with former President Donald Trump is expected to be a close contest. ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos, in Biden's first post-debate television interview, repeatedly pressed the president what he would do if Democratic leaders such as Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries and Pelosi were to tell him they were worried his presence in the race would impact the party's chances of controlling the House and Senate. MORE | Biden dismisses diminishing poll numbers, low approval rating after debate Biden told Stephanopoulos, \"Well, it's, like, they're not gonna do that.\" Schumer on Tuesday simply told reporters multiple times, \"I'm with Joe\" -- but declined to engage in broader questions on Biden's path forward. Jeffries, who earlier this week said he still supported Biden and that his position remained unchanged, huddled behind closed doors on Tuesday with House Democrats to discuss Biden's path forward. Some members described the meeting as \"rough\" and sobering, according to multiple participants. Others described feeling powerless to change course amid Biden's defiance. After the meeting, a seventh House Democrat -- New Jersey's Mikie Sherrill -- publicly called on Biden to exit the race.

                    "text": "You'll soon have to pay more if you want to shop at Costco. The membership-based warehouse club said Wednesday that it will increase its membership fee by $5 in the U.S. and Canada as of Sept. 1. That's an increase to $65 from $60 for annual memberships. Its higher-tier plan, called \"Executive Membership,\" will increase to $130 a year from $120. Costco said the fee increases would affect around 52 million memberships, a little over half of which are executive memberships. Shares rose about 2% in extended trading Wednesday. It marks Costco's first membership rate increase since June 2017. On average, the company has raised rates roughly every five and a half years — which would have put Costco on track to raise the fee in late 2022 or early 2023. However, Costco held off on raising fees prior to now. In interviews with CNBC, CEO Craig Jelinek previously said it wasn't the right time as consumers dealt with high inflation. The company's CFO Richard Galanti made similar comments on prior earnings calls. Costco relies on membership fees to drive most of its revenue and help keep merchandise prices low. Its rival, Walmart-owned Sam's Club, hiked its own membership fee in 2022 for the first time in nine years. Yet even after the fee bump, a Sam's Club membership was cheaper — at $50 for club members and $110 for members of its higher-tier level, \"Plus,\" on an annual basis. At BJ's Wholesale, annual membership fees are $55 and $110, for club members and its own higher tier, respectively. Costco said it stepped up enforcement last year to make sure shoppers weren't using other members' cards. It added an extra check for memberships in self-checkout aisles. The moves were reminiscent of Netflix, which has also cracked down on people who use its service without paying.",

Starting September 1, 2024, Gold Star membership fees will increase by $5 to $65, and Executive Memberships will increase by $10 to $130. The retailer also announced it posted June net sales of $24.48 billion, an increase of 7.4% from a year ago and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.16 per share. Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton discuss the announcement in the video above. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime. This post was written by Stephanie Mikulich. Video Transcript Long awaited by investors here, your Costco membership is getting more expensive. The company announcing it will raise its annual membership fees by $5 in both the US and Canada. Costco last raised the price of membership back in 2017. Costco also reported its net sales for the month of June at $24.48 billion. That's a nearly $2 billion increase from the same period last year. But it is really fee increase. As I said, Josh, investors have been waiting for this one. We've had a couple of people on goodbye or goodbye who have liked Costco but have said Wait for that one. That's the next catalyst that's gonna call it. Did they say this is when it's happening? No. Nobody knew what it was gonna happen. They just happened. They've just been waiting for it to happen. It's been so long. Yeah, June. So June Total Comp says it looks at 5.3% estimate was 6.4%. But clearly investors are cheering that news that that's the headline. That's what's setting it up here in the after hours, at least initially. Yeah, and by the way, the membership increase will be effective September 1st. Um, so if you're a Costco member, as they call it or a customer, Um, that that is when it's going to take effect here. Um, but that's really a lever that people were waiting for. As you say, the comps higher here. If you look at, let's see Costco shares year today. Just taking a quick look. They're up by 34% already this year and rising again. Um, in the after hour session, I'm gonna check to Is that a not quite a record close today? It looks like it might have been a record close yesterday for Costco before we saw a little bit of a decrease in today's session. But, you know, if if the after hours gains hold, we could potentially see a record again on the back of this news, that's just like what they see",

                    "text": "Costco Wholesale said Wednesday it would hike annual membership fees for the first time in seven years for its US and Canada customers, effective Sept. 1. The retailer’s memberships offer a range of incentives to customers, including testing of free samples, discounts on food, gas, home insurance, travel and grocery items and an annual 2% reward on qualified purchases at its warehouses. The annual fee, last raised in June 2017, would increase by $5 to $65 for “gold star” and business members and to $130 from the earlier $120 for executive members, the company said. Costco said the maximum annual 2% reward associated with executive membership will also increase to $1,250 from $1,000. The hike will affect around 52 million members, a little over half of them being of the executive category, the membership-only retailer said. The company’s shares, up about 34% this year, rose 2.2% in extended trading. “The market has been expecting (discussion of) a membership fee hike for a couple years … management historically tends to raise membership rates every 5 to 6 years,” said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors. “This announcement will be a welcome relief to those who have been waiting for it and should provide a solid lift to revenue as well as the stock,” Schulman added. Revenues from membership fees had increased about 7.6% in the third quarter ended May 12. For fiscal 2023, membership fee revenue accounted for 1.9% of the company’s total revenue. Separately, Costco reported on Wednesday a 7.4% increase in net sales to $24.48 billion for the retail month of June.",

                    "text": "By Elisabeth Buchwald | CNN It’s soon going to cost more money to get your foot in the door at Costco. But the good news is your hot dog is still $1.50 — for now at least. The retailer is raising membership fees by $5 to $65 a year in the US and Canada, Costco announced Wednesday. This marks the first time in seven years Costco is raising membership fees. Additionally, Costco’s premium “Executive Membership” is going up by $10 to $130 a year. But those members will soon be able to earn a maximum of $1,250 in rewards annually versus $1,000 currently. The company estimated that 52 million memberships will be impacted, a little over half of which are Executive members, Costco said. Annual fees have been one of the biggest profit-generating areas for Costco, helping it offset expenses to keep its prices down. Last year, Costco earned $4.6 billion in revenue from membership fees, an 8% increase from 2022. The fee hikes are also occurring as Costco, like streaming companies, has been taking more measures to ensure fewer people are hitching a ride on other customers’ memberships. Costco’s hikes, which go into effect on September 1, come more than two years after key rivals Sam’s Club and Amazon raised their membership fees. On Wednesday, Costco also announced that net sales were up 7.4% for the five weeks ended on July 7 compared to last year. Shares of Costco jumped over 2% in after-hours trading following the news.",

It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe “big F-ing deal” Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.” “We are not going to win in November with this president,” the actor continued. “On top of that, we won’t win the House, and we’re going to lose the Senate.” Clooney said that he is among many who hold this belief, including senators, congressional members, and governors that he has spoken with privately, since the debate. “Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly,” he said. Clooney cited intense concerns about Biden’s age, comparing his experience with the President at other fundraising events over the years. “Is it fair to point these things out? he continued. “It has to be. This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed.” Clooney just recently participated in a fundraiser for the Biden-Harris campaign, using his appearance for a contest of small-dollar voters to win a chance to attend the fundraiser and meet the actor and others. The event raised millions of dollars for the campaign for Biden’s reelection, marking the most successful fundraiser in Democratic Party history.",

                    "text": "Longtime Democrat and Oscar-winning actor George Clooney called on President Joe Biden to end his reelection bid and allow the Democratic Party to begin the process of selecting a new nominee for November’s ticket. In an op-ed penned for The New York Times, Clooney wrote that while he loves President Biden as a person and politician, “the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.” “We are not going to win in November with this president,” he wrote. “On top of that, we won’t win the House, and we’re going to lose the Senate. This isn’t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and Congress member and governor that I’ve spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.” The actor added that while the process of selecting a new nominee might be “messy” it would “enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out.” Clooney added that through his own personal interactions with the president, it’s become clear to him that “the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago […] was not the Joe “big F-ing deal” Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.” “This is about age. Nothing more,” Clooney wrote. Three weeks ago, Clooney hosted a large fundraiser in Los Angeles on Biden’s behalf. While the event raised $30 million for the Biden-Harris campaign, many attendees left with the impression that Biden was in decline — a reality that only became more stark on debate night. Earlier this week, Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter in the Obama-Biden administration and the host of Pod Save America, noted that the hosts of the podcast had raised concerns about Biden’s performance following their attendance at the fundraiser. “It was really bad,” he relayed. His co-host Tommy Vietor, a former spokesperson for the Obama administration, added that the event was “chilling, it was very, very, very unnerving.” The hosts pointed out that recent incidents like the fundraiser and the debate had fundamentally changed the calculus of Biden’s nomination, a sentiment that Clooney echoed in his piece for the Times. “It is disingenuous, at best, to argue that Democrats have already spoken with their vote and therefore the nomination is settled and done, when we just received new and upsetting information,” he wrote. Clooney is not the only prominent Hollywood Democrat to call on Biden to step down from his campaign. Actor and director Rob Reiner wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that “It’s time to stop fucking around/ If the Convicted Felon wins, we lose our Democracy. Joe Biden has effectively served US with honor, decency, and dignity. It’s time for Joe Biden to step down,” Earlier this week, author and longtime Democrat Stephen King wrote on X that “Joe Biden has been a fine president, but it’s time for him—in the interests of the America he so clearly loves—to announce he will not run for re-election.” Oscar-winning film director Michael Moore accused those advising the president to stay in the race of “elder abuse,” during Monday’s episode of his Rumble podcast. “He was in epic distress [during the debate],” Moore said. “Every cognitive default in his mind seemed to be shutting down. If this had been somebody that you truly cared about, loved, embraced, what would you have done? Would you have seriously even let him go out on that stage?” “Let him rest. Let him go home. He has done his job. Let him have his dignity,” he added.",

This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\" Reached for comment, a Biden campaign spokesman pointed CNBC to the president's comments insisting that he will stay in the race. As Biden digs in, the delicate question of how to convince him to abandon the race is vexing Democrats on Capitol Hill. Clooney implored Democratic leaders like Pelosi to ask the president to stand down. \"Top Democrats — Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi — and senators, representatives and other candidates who face losing in November need to ask this president to voluntarily step aside,\" Clooney wrote. Clooney also wrote that the president's performances after the late June debate hadn't been good enough to quell concerns, including Biden's recent interview on ABC. \"The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before,\" wrote Clooney. \"As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question,\" Clooney wrote. Clooney was also careful to praise the president, who has racked up a string of legislative accomplishments in office. \"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.\" But for the Biden campaign, Clooney represents only the latest wealthy Democratic party contributor to call on the president to step down. Abigail Disney, Stewart Bainum Jr. and Reed Hastings are among the party's donors who have already publicly said the president should pass the baton to another candidate. Disney and philanthropist and investor Gideon Stein both told CNBC they were done helping Democrats raise money, unless Biden announces that he won't run for reelection.",

                    "text": "George Clooney has joined the pool of celebrities who have urged President Joe Biden to step down from the race. In a new op-ed written for The New York Times, the 63-year-old movie star emphasized that the 81-year-old politician is a “hero” but claimed he “cannot” win against Donald Trump. “I love Joe Biden,” George began in the essay that was published on Wednesday, July 10. “As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he’s won many of the battles he’s faced.” However, the Up in the Air actor noted, “But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can.” “It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe ‘big F-ing deal’ Biden of 2010,” George admitted, before adding, “He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.” George was referring to the June 27 debate between Joe and Donald, 78. Throughout the televised event, viewers witnessed the former senator stumble over a few responses. As a result, many have alleged that Joe’s age has affected his leadership capabilities. “This is about age. Nothing more,” George continued. “But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won’t win the House, and we’re going to lose the Senate. This isn’t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I’ve spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.” Without naming any of the apparent politicians he’s spoken to, George concluded his op-ed by calling the president a “hero” and noted that he “saved democracy in 2020.” “We need him to do it again in 2024,” George added, referring to the choice for Joe to withdraw from the race. After the debate against Donald aired last month, multiple politicians have publicly pleaded for Joe to step aside. However, the president insisted that he is staying in the race, according to a letter obtained by CNN earlier this week. “I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere, I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,” Joe wrote. “We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election. Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us. It is time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump.”",

                    "title": "George Clooney Begs Joe Biden To Drop Out Weeks After Raising $30 Million For His Campaign: \"It's Devastating To Say It\"",
                    "text": "George Clooney has joined the growing list of high-profile Democrats calling for President Joe Biden to suspend his campaign. The Hollywood actor wrote in a New York Times op-ed that his political party is “not going to win in November with this president,” predicting that Democrats will also lose the House and the Senate if they keep Biden on the ballot. “This isn’t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I’ve spoken with in private,” he said. “Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.” Just last month, Clooney co-hosted a star-studded fundraiser that raised a whopping $30 million for Biden’s campaign. But even at the event, Biden displayed questionable characteristics, according to Clooney. “It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe ‘big F-ing deal’ Biden of 2010,” he said. “He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.” Clooney expressed concerns over Biden’s age and ability to beat Donald Trump following his disastrous debate performance, which the White House has repeatedly blamed on the President’s cold and jet lag. “Our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw,” Clooney wrote. “We’re all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we’ve opted to ignore every warning sign. Is it fair to point these things out? It has to be. This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed.” In response to Biden’s attempt to reassure voters via his televised interview with George Stephanopoulos, Clooney said their sit-down “only reinforced what we saw” at the debate. “As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question,” he added, referring to Biden infamously tripping up the stairs of his plane and giving incoherent responses to reporters sans his teleprompter. Clooney further called on top Democrats like Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi and Hakeem Jeffries to ask Biden to “voluntarily step aside,” despite the POTUS declaring that he won’t be going anywhere. “Would it be messy? Yes. Democracy is messy,” Clooney said. “But would it enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out? It sure would.” The Oscar-winning actor also spent some time praising Biden, noting that he loved the politician as a senator, a vice president and president. And while he wrote that Biden has “won many of the battles he’s faced” in the last four years, he cannot win the “fight against time.” “Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020,” Clooney said. “We need him to do it again in 2024.”",

                    "text": "Hollywood star George Clooney has called on Democrats to name a new nominee for the 2024 presidential election, claiming President Joe Biden “cannot win.” Clooney made the call for a new candidate in an op-ed published in The New York Times Wednesday, nearly four weeks after he co-hosted a star-studded Biden fundraiser in Los Angeles. Clooney said he noticed that the 81-year-old president at that event wasn’t the Biden of 2010 or of 2020, but the “man we all witnessed at the debate.” In referring to Biden’s halting, inarticulate, politically disastrous debate performance, Clooney said, “Our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw. We’re all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we’ve opted to ignore every warning sign.” The Oscar winner also said that Biden’s interview with George Stephanopoulos “only reinforced what we saw the week before.

Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.” With that, Clooney called on party leaders to speak up and call on Biden to step aside, saying that the party is filled with “a very exciting bench” of potential contenders, including Kamala Harris, Wes Moore, Gretchen Whitmer, Gavin Newsom, Andy Beshear, J.B. Pritzker and others. Clooney acknowledged that the process of selecting a new nominee will be “messy,” but he said “democracy is messy” and it would “enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out.” Clooney concluded his op-ed by saying “Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020.

                    "text": "Hollywood icon and longtime Democratic fund-raising leader George Clooney has joined a growing list of political and entertainment figures calling for President Joe Biden to bow out of the 2024 election race against Donald Trump. Like many before him, the Oscar-winning actor and producer cited concerns over Biden's 81 years of age impacting his ability to lead the party to victory in November, but added that, before Biden's disastrous performance at the June 27 debate, he witnessed Biden's decline in person at a political event nearly three weeks ago. \"I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he’s won many of the battles he’s faced,\" Clooney wrote in a New York Times essay published Wednesday, in which he acknowledged his friendship with Biden. \"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F---ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\" He continued: \"Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw. We’re all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we’ve opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\" Clooney also alleged that he's spoken to numerous Democratic senators and members of congress in private in recent days, and that \"every single one\" shares the sentiment that \"we are not going to win in November with this president.\" He also claimed that many of the politicians he spoke with have different forward-facing stances on the issue, and are \"saying publicly\" things that contradict how they really feel about Biden's acuity. The 63-year-old goes on to suggest that several prominent Democrats could step up to lead the November ticket, noting that the nominating process at the 2024 Democratic National Convention could “enliven our party and wake up voters\" among the base. \"We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth,\" Clooney wrote, finishing the essay with a final note of praise for Biden before calling on him to bow out once again. \"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.\" Entertainment Weekly has reached out to the White House and the Biden campaign for a response. When reached for comment, Clooney's publicist tells EW there's \"nothing to add\" to the actor's New York Times essay. Others who've attended recent events with Biden have praised the president on social media, including diplomat James Costos, who tweeted Wednesday that he was \"proud to be with\" Biden in person in Los Angeles. Amid sustained calls from both Democrats and Republicans to drop out of the matchup against Trump, both Biden and White House representatives have maintained that he'll remain in the race. Biden confirmed in a July 5 X post that he's “not letting one 90-minute debate wipe out three and a half years of work. I'm staying in the race, and I will beat Donald Trump.\" New York's governor, Kathy Hochul, also recently told MSNBC that Biden is the best candidate running, and that she felt emboldened to support him after meeting with him less than a day after the debate. Want more movie news? Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free newsletter to get the latest trailers, celebrity interviews, film reviews, and more. “What I saw less than 24 hours after the performance the night before, was Joe Biden himself, at his best, energetic, fully alert, and conversational,” Hochul said. \"One bad night does not affect three-and-a-half years of stellar accomplishment, and I’m really excited about the next four years ahead as well.\" Other entertainment figures calling for Biden to let another Democratic candidate tap in for the party include several cohosts on The View — particularly Sara Haines and former Trump White House communications staffer Alyssa Farah Griffin. \"It kind of pains me to say this today, but I think President Biden needs to step down and be replaced if we want to defeat Donald Trump in November,\" Haines said, urging Democrats to stop \"twisting the age issue\" by making excuses for Biden's performance. Also amongst Biden's critics are Stephen King, Rob Reiner, Michael Moore, and Michael Douglas — the last of whom said Wednesday on The View that he worries about Biden's fitness for office in the near future if he's elected to a second term.",

Though not quite as powerful or versatile as full-size models, these countertop devices can whip up fruit smoothies, creamy pesto and emulsified sauces in a matter of seconds. After testing nine top-rated models over the course of a month, I’m confident the Nutribullet Pro 900 is the best model for most home cooks, thanks to its ease of use, powerful motor and reasonable price. Five personal blenders impressed during testing, including the Nutribullet Pro 900 and the Beast ... [+] Blender. Illustration: Forbes / Image: Retailers Here are the very best models, based on my testing: Best Personal Blender Overall: Nutribullet Pro 900 Best Budget Personal Blender: Ninja Fit Best Upgrade Personal Blender: Beast Blender Tonal Best Portable Blender: Cuisinart EvolutionX Cordless Compact Blender Best-Designed Personal Blender: Zwilling Enfinigy Personal Blender Ideal for smaller portions, personal blenders have a lot in common with standard blenders—they just come in a more compact package. Most models can hold between 16 and 32 ounces and come with multiple cups, as well as to-go lids and other accessories. “It’s my go-to gadget,” says cookbook author Carissa Stanton, who uses a personal blender every day for smoothies (as well as the occasional dip and sauce). “It’s also easy to store when you don’t want to have it out on the counter.” Recipe developer and food editor Fatima Khawaja, who relies heavily on personal blenders as a private chef, appreciates being able to refrigerate pulverized mixtures right in the modest-sized blender cups, then reblending days after if the mixture separates or she wants to make a bit more. Simply put, there’s a lot to love about these pint-sized kitchen appliances. Ahead, find the standout models that impressed me the most during testing. Best Personal Blender Overall A Best-Selling Model With A Powerful 900-Watt Motor Amazon Nutribullet Pro 900 Volume: 32 ounces | Dimensions: 7.7 x 12 x 15.9 inches | Weight: 4.7 pounds | Wattage: 900 watts | Additional pieces: Two blending cups with to-go lids, two handled lip rings, two cup rings, recipe book Best for: Powerful, efficient blending Those who appreciate a simple, straightforward interface Blending large servings at once Skip if: You want a blender that’s less than $100 You want an extra-lightweight blender While testing the most popular personal blenders, I wasn’t surprised that a Nutribullet model—part of a brand that considers itself a pioneer in the space—earned the highest marks overall. Featuring a 32-ounce volume, which can accommodate two single-serving smoothies at once, this blender offers great versatility at a reasonable price. Not only did it blend smoothies with ease, but it made a creamy pesto and a lovely vinaigrette. A smoothie made in the Nutribullet Pro 900. Rebecca Firkser Equipped with a 900-watt motor, this blender was one of the least powerful I tested, but I found it to be just as efficient as models with more wattage. It was also a breeze to use. To operate it, fill the cup, screw on the lid with the blades, invert the whole thing and press it into the base, then twist into place to start running. The result: automatic, hands-off blending. What’s more, it’s not difficult to pulse with this blender. Though it doesn’t have a dedicated button, like some newer Nutribullet models, you can easily twist and untwist the blending cup to start and stop the machine. I also found it easy to clean, as the wider cup was especially easy to fit a sponge into. Alongside the motor base and blades, the Nutribullet comes with two cups, two to-go lids, two lip rings with handles, two cup rings for sipping and a recipe book. Simply put, this Goldilocks of a personal blender would prove a worthy addition to any kitchen. Another nice perk: Whereas most personal blenders come in just black or silver, the base of the Nutribullet comes in more than 10 colors, including both matte and metallic hues. (For more details, check out my in-depth review of the Nutribullet Pro 900.) The 2024 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards are here: Explore our 150 top-recommended items across categories after extensive research and testing. Best Budget Personal Blender A Reliable Pick For Less Than $60 Amazon Ninja Fit Volume: 16 ounces | Dimensions: 4.3 x 4.3 x 13 inches | Weight 3.1 pounds | Wattage: 700 watts | Additional pieces: Two blending cups with to-go lids, recipe book Best for: Pulsed sauces like pesto Powerful, efficient blending Easily moving from cabinet to countertop Skip if: You want to walk away while blending You want a quiet model You’re looking for a more aesthetically pleasing blender Affordable and extra compact, the Ninja Fit blew me away during testing, as it kept up with models twice its price. It sailed through every culinary challenge, and the pesto in particular was especially great: It came out evenly chopped and not overly emulsified. Though some might find its 16-ounce volume to be limiting, I was able to make a sizable one-serving smoothie and plenty of crushed ice for a few drinks. It’s also very lightweight, which made it a snap to assemble and get blending. The main downside to this model is that you have to continuously hold down on the cup to activate the motor—meaning you have to stand over the blender while it runs, which is relatively loud. It’s also not exactly the best-looking, highest-quality option out there. (Its base is made from shiny black plastic, and its overall design isn’t anything special, which is to say the look fits the price of this one.) That said, you’d be hard-pressed to find a more powerful, efficient personal blender for less than $60. It comes with two plastic blending cups with to-go lids, two cup rings, two handled lip rings and a recipe book. Best Upgrade Personal Blender An Ultra-Powerful, Intuitive Model That’s Worth The Price Amazon Beast Blender Tonal Volume: 33.8 ounces | Dimensions: 4.9 x 4.9 x 15.8 inches | Weight: 6.7 pounds | Wattage: 1,000 watts | Additional pieces: Two blending cups (33.8 ounces and 16.9 ounces), two storage lids, drinking lid, two straws, straw cap, two cleaning brushes, stainless steel bottle Best for: Well-emulsified smoothies A one-minute hands-free blending option Blending large servings at once Making creamy sauces like Caesar dressing and mayonnaise Skip if: You want a small, lightweight personal blender You’re content making smoothies in your high-powered blender You don’t care about extra features For those who are willing to spend extra for a premium blender that’s as pretty as it is powerful, the Beast Blender Tonal is worth the splurge. Featuring a 1,000-watt motor, this model aced all its tests, producing ultra-creamy smoothies and sauces. I also appreciate that the blending vessels are made from Tritan, an ultra-durable material that’s BPA-free, and that the included accessories are actually useful: Along with two blending cups (33.8 ounces and 16.9 ounces), a stainless steel bottle and various lids, the blender comes with a brush for cleaning the blade, two reusable straws and a straw cleaner. The Beast Blender is so strong, the pesto is made was almost too creamy. Rebecca Firkser What sets this blender apart (other than its sharp look) is what the brand refers to as its “blade with a brain.” Whereas other models with auto-blend settings would run for 30 or 45 seconds and then stop, the Beast’s single one-minute cycle pauses the motor and adjusts as needed to agitate the ingredients, making for a better emulsion. (It also keeps track of the internal temperature.) Among the biggest fans of this function is Stanton, who uses a Beast blender every day to make a smoothie. “Usually, if I’m going to be blending something, I’ll blend it and then I’ll take the lid off and shake it to make sure nothing gets stuck and I don’t have any chunks,” she says. With the Beast blender, that type of intervention is rarely necessary. Not only did it yield a beautiful vinaigrette, as it quickly blitzed the shallot, but the pesto also came out extra smooth, if not a little too smooth. (Here’s my full Beast Blender review.) Best Portable Blender An On-The-Go Pick That Says, ‘No Outlet? No Problem’ Amazon Cuisinart EvolutionX Cordless Compact Blender Volume: 16 ounces | Dimensions: 3.5 x 3.9 x 11.7 inches | Weight: 2.2 pounds | Voltage: 7.4 volts | Additional pieces: Two lithium batteries, USB charging cable, plastic cup with travel lid Best for: Dorm rooms, offices and other indoor spaces that may not have easily accessible outlets Blending outdoors Skip if: You’re more interested in a blender’s performance than whether it has to be plugged in You want a bigger blending vessel Designed for on-the-go use, portable blenders have a lot in common with standard personal blenders—the main difference is that they’re battery-powered. They also tend to be less powerful, which is why this Cuisinart EvolutionX impressed me so much during testing. Not only did it make a fine smoothie (though it was slightly icy), but it also crushed ice with ease and produced a very decent pesto. Though it doesn’t have the power of plug-in personal blenders, the perk of this model is that it can be used truly anywhere, from the campsite to the dorm room to the gym. The main downside to this blender—and all portable models, for that matter—is you have to remember to charge it. The EvolutionX comes with two lithium batteries and a USB charging cable, and to reach full battery, you need to charge it for two hours; once fully charged, it offers 20 minutes of continuous runtime. Though that might not seem like the longest time, just think about how long it takes to whip up a smoothie (not that long). Lastly, whereas the blending jar and motor on most portable models don’t come apart, which makes drinking out of the vessel awkward and cleaning more difficult, the parts on this model detach. Best-Designed Personal Blender A Pick That’s Easy To Use And Lovely To Look At Amazon Zwilling Enfinigy Personal Blender Volume: 20 ounces | Dimensions: 5.4 x 5.4 x 14 inches | Weight: 4.4 pounds | Wattage: 500 watts | Additional pieces: Tritan cup with plastic to-go lid, seal lid Best for: Making a quick smoothie with easy cleanup, and taking the cup on the go Those who want to leave their personal blender on the kitchen counter Efficient ice crushing and blending for smoothies and other drinks Skip if: You’d rather have something cheaper You’re willing to spend a bit more on the upgrade pick The Zwilling Enfinigy Personal Blender is my best-designed pick for two reasons: It’s intuitive to use and good-looking. Straight out of the box, the blender was a breeze to operate. Using the control wheel on the front of the machine’s base, you choose between two straightforward settings: smoothie and pulse. Once you’re done blending, the 20-ounce Tritan cup—which is sleek and modern—is comfortable to grip, thanks to its slim, roughly rectangular design and ribbed exterior. (The interior is smooth.) Lastly, the stainless steel blades on this model are serrated to help cut through tough ingredients. One important thing to note: The Enfinigy has one of the weaker motors of the blenders that I tested, coming in at 500 watts. As a result, it doesn’t always produce perfectly smooth blends. When I used the auto-blend smoothie function, some ice came out unblended, and a few pieces of kale didn’t come out fully chopped in the pesto. All things considered, though, I still think this is a great personal blender—especially for those interested in an attractive model to keep out on their countertop. All the winning personal blenders. Rebecca Firkser MORE FROMFORBES VETTED Samsung Unpacked 2024 Debuts New Foldable Phones, A Smart Ring And More By Christian de Looper Contributor Casper One Mattress Review: Comfort With A New And Improved Design By McKenzie Dillon Forbes Staff Other Personal Blenders I Tested I tested four other blenders that didn’t make my winners’ list, though I should note that they all worked decently well. In fact, if you’re drawn to one of the models below and it suits your budget and blending needs, I don’t think you can go wrong with any of the ones I tested. Nutribullet Ultra: Featuring a 1,200-watt blender, the Nutribullet Ultra is the brand’s newest, most advanced model. During testing, I appreciated the blender’s relatively quiet operation, as well as its construction: It’s made from Tritan Renew, a partially recycled version of the ultra-durable plastic. Though I don’t think this model is overpriced, I think the less expensive Nutribullet Pro 900 is just as effective and versatile, which is why it scored slightly higher than the Ultra. Our Place Splendor Blender: The recently released Our Place Splendor Blender—which costs $125—was neck and neck with the Beast model in every culinary test, performing on par or just below it. The blenders also share somewhat of a similar design: They have an hourglass shape, ribbed container and heavy base to support a 1,000-watt motor. That said, the Beast ultimately outperformed it, as the Our Place model’s pesto was a little chunky, and its smoothie was slightly loose. Magic Bullet: Like many people, I first learned of Magic Bullet through infomercials, though I’d never actually used one before testing. Though I wasn’t disappointed by this blender, I wasn’t blown away by it either. It made a good smoothie (with some bits of unchopped ice) but not the best pesto: It struggled to chop the ingredients at first, though it eventually overblended them. Still, considering its low price, I think home cooks who want an affordable, easy-to-store model for making smoothies would be happy with this one. Ninja Blast Portable Blender: The Ninja Blast was one of two portable blenders I tested, and it made a decent smoothie and crushed ice. I found it to be a little awkward, though. The base doesn’t detach from the blending cup, meaning you have to drink from the blender on its base or pour the smoothie into a cup. Lastly, though the blender was fairly powerful, it needed a good amount of liquid to get things going, so it struggled with the pesto test. How I Tested The Best Personal Blenders After unboxing each blender, I considered each model’s overall quality and design, as well as the additional pieces included. Then, because personal blenders are typically associated with smoothies, I started by making one in each. I used frozen blueberries, fresh banana, fresh spinach, chia seeds, milk and two ice cubes. I observed how long it took the model to blitz the ingredients into a smooth, drinkable blend. (If the blender had an automatic smoothie function, I used it as many times as needed until it looked blended.) Next, I removed the blade, screwed on the to-go lid and shook the cup to see if it leaked. I then took a sip to test how easy it was to drink from the to-go lid. Lastly, I strained the remaining smoothie through a fine-mesh sieve to see if any ingredients came out large or chunky. Ice pulverized in the Nutribullet Pro 900. Rebecca Firkser Once that test was completed, I made raw kale pesto (with olive oil, toasted almonds, garlic, finely grated Parmesan and lemon juice) to test each blender’s ability to break down fibrous leafy greens and hard nuts. During this test, I noted which models finely chopped the pesto into a uniformly chunky sauce, as opposed to simply turning it into an ultra-emulsified savory smoothie. I then pulsed ice and water in each blender to see which were capable of making crushed ice, which you might want for cocktails or other drinks. To wrap up, I made a vinaigrette in the best-performing blenders, as each expert I consulted said they love using the countertop devices for salad dressing. (I used olive oil, red wine vinegar, shallot and Dijon mustard.) I also assessed the ease of cleaning throughout. After the smoothie test, I rinsed each blender cup with hot water, then ran the cup (and to-go lid, if listed as dishwasher-safe) through the dishwasher. Then, I hand-washed the blades and other remaining pieces, according to each brand’s directions. After the pesto test, I rinsed each blender cup and blade with hot water, added a cup of room-temperature water and a small pump of dish soap to the cup, screwed the blade back on and then ran the blender again for 30 seconds to “self-clean” the vessel. After rinsing out the soapy water with hot water, I air-dried the pieces. Then, I smelled the cups to see if any had residual garlic odor. How To Pick A Personal Blender Thinking of adding one of these compact blenders to your arsenal of kitchen devices? Here are the most important factors to keep in mind as you shop. Capacity Most personal blenders can accommodate between 16 and 32 ounces, making them ideal for whipping up small batches of a smoothie, salad dressing, pesto and more. If you want the option to make smoothies for two, for example, opt for a model on the higher end of that range. Just keep in mind that the larger the capacity, the more cabinet space the piece requires. If you’re concerned about storage, ask yourself these questions, offered by Khawaja: “How much space is this going to take on my counter? Is there room in my cabinet? Is it going to be too tall so I’ll have to put it sideways in my cabinet, or does it disassemble in two parts and I can put it side by side?” Power “I’ll always look at the wattage,” says food stylist Drew Aichele, who says he’s “pretty brutal” with his personal blender, using it often for blended margaritas and finely grating firm cheese. Most personal blenders fall in the range between 175 watts and 1,000 watts. If you want a blender that can handle ice and other frozen foods, it’s best to opt for a higher wattage. Otherwise, you might need to break up food into smaller chunks or pieces for the blender to process completely. Ease Of Use And Cleaning If a personal blender is challenging to put together, annoying to blend or a pain to clean, there’s a good chance you won’t find yourself reaching for it in the kitchen. While most personal blenders operate hands-free (once you lock the cup into place, the model runs), some more basic models have cups that need to be held in place for the machine to work. The latter does offer more control—think of using the “pulse” function on a food processor—though it’s objectively less convenient. Additionally, if you don’t like to hand-wash your dishes, check to make sure the model you’re eyeing has dishwasher-safe parts. Price Generally speaking, a personal blender will set you back anywhere between $50 and $150, though some models fall outside this range. (Smeg, for instance, has a retro-inspired model that retails for $170.) Models from direct-to-consumer brands like Beast and Our Place are typically more expensive, as they’re designed with both aesthetics and performance in mind. Less souped-up models from brands like Magic Bullet and Ninja, on the other hand, are comparatively inexpensive. Additionally, the higher the capacity, the more expensive the model tends to be. If you’re just looking for something basic to make single-serving smoothies and the occasional pesto or dressing, you can likely get away with a less powerful and more affordable model. My Expertise I’m a writer, recipe developer, recipe tester, food stylist and culinary producer with nearly a decade of experience, and I’ve worked for Food52, Bon Appétit, Epicurious, Taste, the Strategist and NYT Cooking (among other food publications). For Forbes Vetted, I’ve tested and reviewed the best carbon steel pans, and I wrote an accompanying cleaning guide. I also—and this is relevant to this article—have used quite a few blenders throughout my career, from standard versions to immersion blenders. I also spoke with three experts in the food industry who regularly use blenders in myriad styles. Carissa Stanton, author of the cookbook Seriously, So Good, uses a personal blender every day and has discovered the tool often fits her culinary needs more than upright blenders or food processors. (She loves to make extra-creamy hummus in her personal blender.) Drew Aichele is a food stylist who uses a personal blender for finely grating Parmesan cheese and whipping up crêpe batter. Fatima Khawaja is a chef and food editor who’s gotten to know her way around the countertop device through her experience as a personal chef; some of her clients only own personal models, not upright or immersion blenders, so she’s adapted recipes to fit the equipment. How Powerful Are Personal Blenders? Personal blenders are unlikely to be as powerful as upright blenders, especially high-powered models. Because there’s no way to vent a personal blender, they can’t be used for hot liquids like soup, whereas upright blender lids typically have a venting method. That said, personal blenders have their strengths. Because of their small size, they’re typically lighter in weight, easier to store and simpler to wash. What Are The Disadvantages Of Personal Blenders? The main difference between standard blenders and personal models is their size: The former have larger capacities, allowing you to make bigger batches of food. Additionally, personal blenders do not offer ventilation, so they cannot be used to blend hot ingredients. Lastly, some models (especially higher-wattage ones) can cost as much as—if not more than—no-frills standard blenders. Rebecca Firkser Following Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions",

While they’re kind of always going to, well, stink, the best changing tables certainly make cleanups a little easier—and maybe even a little cheerier (maybe). The ideal changing table, like our top pick the Babyletto Sprout 3-Drawer Changing Table, offers a sturdy spot for diaper changes, as well as additional storage for essentials like wipes, fresh onesies and, of course, the diapers. The best changing tables make diaper duty easier, while also offering storage for all the needed ... [+] supplies. Illustration: Forbes / Photos: Retailers But before purchasing a changing table, it’s important to consider the amount of space you have available, parental height and your family’s specific set of needs. You’ll need to consider safety features, too. “Having a changing station in the nursery is an excellent idea for several reasons,” says pediatrician Dr. Adrianna Bravo. “The number one reason is safety, safety, safety. Ensure your changing table or pad has guardrails or raised sides at least 2 inches high. That will act as a deterrent for the baby rolling off the table. Parents should also make it a standard practice always to keep one hand on the baby.” Here are the 10 best changing tables to consider adding to your nursery. Best Changing Table Overall: Babyletto Sprout 3-Drawer Changing Table Best Value Changing Table: Delta Children Wilmington Changing Table With Pad Best Changing Table For Small Spaces: Storkcraft Modern Changing Table & Bookcase Best Splurge Changing Table: Pottery Barn Kids Kendall Extra-Wide Nursery Dresser And Topper Set Best Freestanding Changing Table: DaVinci Jenny Lind Changing Table With Pad Best Large Changing Table: Nurture& The Dresser Best Small Dresser And Changing Table: Babyletto Hudson 3-Drawer Changer Dresser Best Changing Table And Crib Combo: Graco Hadley 5-In-1 Convertible Crib And Changer With Drawer Best Convertible Changing Table: Little Seeds Monarch Hill Haven Changing Table Dresser Best Portable Changing Table: Sweeby Portable Baby Changing Table Best Overall Changing Table Excellent Quality And Value MOST POPULAR Wayfair Babyletto Sprout 3-Drawer Changing Table Material: Pine, engineered wood | Dimensions: 41.5 x 20 x 36 inches | Convertible: Yes | Weight limit: 30 pounds | Greenguard Gold Certified: Yes The Babyletto Sprout is our top pick overall because it works so well for so many homes and families. It’s not too big or too small. It’s not too tall or too short—and it’s not too outrageously priced or too cheap. In short, this changing table and three-drawer dresser is a good option for just about any nursery. At 99 pounds, it’s sturdy and has quality craftsmanship. It’s available in three finishes. This changing table is made from pine and manufactured wood, features smooth-glide drawers and has several safety features to keep your child safe, including an anti-tip kit and drawers that don’t pull out all the way, further lowering the risk of tipping and injuries. It’s also consciously made, Greenguard certified and uses low VOC materials. Because it includes storage drawers and a removable changing topper, this piece can be used as a dresser before and after the diaper years. What the parents say: Overall the consensus is that the dresser is fantastic but can be tricky to assemble. Regardless, one reviewer called it the “perfect addition for the new nursery. Easy to put together and great quality.” Best Value Changing Table An Affordable And Popular Option Amazon Delta Children Wilmington Changing Table Material: Wood, engineered wood | Dimensions: ‎39 x 2o x 35 inches | Convertible: Yes | Weight limit: 24 pounds | Greenguard Gold Certified: No If you’re looking for an affordable changing table, consider this streamlined Delta changing table. It’s far less expensive than most other options, and is an Amazon bestseller with 8,000 reviews and an overall rating 4.8 out of 5 stars. It’s well constructed and assembly isn’t difficult. What the parents say: Parents say the beauty of this changing table is its simplicity. “I could not be more happy with this changing table. It’s beautiful, strong, and easy to assemble,” writes one reviewer. Parents also like that with the addition of a few fabric bins you can use it to store diapering essentials, toys, books and extra clothes. Once your baby becomes a big kid, it can be used as a bookshelf or a vanity. As one parent put it, it has “longevity.” Best Changing Table For Small Spaces Makes The Most Of Your Space Storkcraft Storkcraft Modern Changing Table & Bookcase Material: Engineered wood | Dimensions: 36 x 19 x 33 inches| Convertible: Yes | Weight limit: 30 pounds | Greenguard Gold Certified: Yes Thia Storkcraft changing table is slim and saves space by providing a changing table and storage/bookshelf all in one. We appreciate that it can keep all of your diapering essentials in one place during the baby years, but can also be used for storage, toys and books as your child grows. It’s even low enough that babies can help themselves to toys on the lower shelves, which promotes independent play. It’s Greenguard Gold and JPMA-certified, but doesn’t include an anti-tip kit so be sure to snag one of those, too. It’s about 33-inches in width, but reviewers seem happy with the amount of space and storage it provides. Many note, however, that putting the piece together is better done with two people and some patience. The changing topper is removable. What the parents say: Parents appreciate the height and storage options this changing table provides. One mom writes, “It was a little hard to put together, but take your time, give yourself two hours and it’s perfect. My daughter always laughs and smiles now when we are on the changing table, and with all the stuff we need underneath with her toys on the bottom, it's just perfect.” Best Splurge Changing Table Spacious Drawers For Storage To Grow With Your Family Pottery Barn Kids Pottery Barn Kids Kendall Extra-Wide Nursery Dresser And Topper Set Material: Sap gum wood, manufactured wood | Dimensions: 54.5 x 18.5 x 32.5 inches | Convertible: Yes | Weight limit: 50 pounds | Greenguard Gold Certified: Yes This Pottery Barn Kids changing table and dresser combination stands out due to its quality, style and staying power. It’s large enough that even as your baby (and their clothing size) grows, it can easily transition to a traditional full-size dresser. It’s the ideal height for parents, and the small drawers at the top are perfect for small children’s clothes and diapers. Once your baby is finished with diapers, the seven drawers work for better sorting of all their clothes. The topper can be easily removed, too. This changing table/dresser comes in five classic colors and matches the Kendall nursery collection at Pottery Barn Kids, including one of our top-choice cribs. It’s Greenguard Gold certified and made in a Fair Trade certified factory. All of Pottery Barn Kids’ furniture includes pre-tested anti-tip kits. This one also offers adjustable levelers to ensure stability no matter the condition of your floors. It arrives assembled via white glove delivery services, so you don’t have to built it yourself. What the parents say: Mom of four, McKenna Fakheri, calls this her favorite dresser. “When I compare it to the ones I purchased for my other three children, it stands out, because it has seven drawers—four large and three small,” she says. “The others are only six drawers, which allows for less designated space for socks and other miscellaneous items.” Best Freestanding Changing Table A Stylish, Streamlined Set With Open Shelves Amazon DaVinci Jenny Lind Changing Table With Pad Material: Pine, engineered wood | Dimensions: 36 x 19 x 40 inches | Convertible: Yes | Weight limit: 30 pounds | Greenguard Gold Certified: No While this DaVinci Jenny Lind changing table is similar in concept to our budget option, this piece has a more elevated look. Many families opt for changing tables with dresser drawers, but one reviewer explained why a standalone changing table is ideal for some nurseries: “Having this changing table separate from my dresser allowed me to put other things on the dresser (lamp, frames) and have everything an arm-length away. It has a small footprint, which is nice for a small space. I have been very happy with this product.” The open shelving makes it easy to grab what you need for changes, and it includes an anti-tip kit. Other reviewers noted that it’s easy to assemble and sturdy but slim. Plus, the brand offers a matching crib. What the parents say: Like many who purchased this changing table, one reviewer adored it but noted they did need to purchase a separate changing pad even though one is included. “Great changing table. It was easy to put together, it's sturdy, and it looks fabulous. The only cons are that the boards for the shelves and top seem a tiny bit flimsy,” they say. Best Large Changing Table Seven Drawers, Plus Extendable Sides Nurture& Nurture& The Dresser Material: Rubberwood, fiberboard, plywood | Dimensions: 32.5 x 54.5 x 19 inches | Convertible: Yes | Weight Limit: 150 pounds | Greenguard Gold Certified: No If you want more drawer space, this beautiful wood dresser from Nurture& might be ideal. It comes fully assembled (many options on this list take hours to put together), is timeless in style and provides plenty of space. Most notably, this option has extendable sides that allow for even more storage. The topper, which is sold separately and costs an additional $199, runs the span of the dresser, so it too offers plenty of space for diapering essentials. This means you don’t have to store them in one of the seven drawers. If you want to place other nursery essentials like a sound machine or baby monitor on the dresser, these easily fit on the extendable sides. Nurture& offers matching nursery furniture that can be bundled together for a reduced price—a plus since this changing table and dresser are on the expensive side. What the parents say: “We love that there are side table pull outs. We use them every day. Also, we love that it came all put together,” says one of many happy reviewers. Another writes: “I bought this dresser because I was so happy with the glider, I am yet again so impressed by the high quality of this piece.” Best Small Dresser And Changing Table Combo Drawers And Shelves In A Petite Package Amazon Babyletto Hudson 3-Drawer Changer Dresser Material: Pine, engineered wood | Dimensions: ‎39 x 19 x 37 inches | Convertible: Yes | Weight limit: 30 pounds | Greenguard Gold Certified: Yes There are plenty of changing table dresser combinations on the market, but this petite Babyletto piece includes several features that improve the functionality of any nursery. For one, the topper has a cordoned off space for diapering essentials like wipes and creams, and the dresser offers three compact drawers. It also matches our top crib pick, the Babyletto Hudson. We also love the two enclosed shelves that can be utilized in a way that suits your family. Keep in mind that the drawers aren’t the roomiest, so they won’t fit an older child’s clothes as your baby grows beyond toddlerhood. On top of the utility this changing table offers, it’s also Greenguard Gold certified and includes safety features like an anti-tip kit and stop mechanisms on the drawer. Just keep in mind that it requires assembly, which some parents found to be quite time-consuming. What the parents say: “I needed a small, good quality changing table for a small space (our bathroom). It looks so good and heavy in a good way. Plenty of storage and assembly was straightforward,” writes one Wayfair reviewer. A happy Amazon customer says: “This is a very sturdy changing table that I feel safe to put my baby on. It being Greenguard Gold certified gives me extra piece of mind. The drawers and door run smoothly.” Best Changing Table And Crib Combo Three Essentials In One Affordable Package Amazon Graco Hadley 5-In-1 Convertible Crib And Changer With Drawer Material: Pine wood, engineered wood, wood composites | Dimensions: 72 x 30 x 40 inches | Convertible: Yes | Weight limit: 50 pounds | Greenguard Gold Certified: No This classic looking (and affordable) crib isn’t just a place to let your baby get some shut-eye—it’s also a changing table and dresser. Plus it has additional storage space underneath it, and it coverts to a full-size daybed or toddler bed with the purchase of a conversion kit. The footprint is larger than some of the other options we’ve included, but that’s because it’s several products in one. The addition of the changing table and storage mean this combo is ideal for smaller spaces—and it makes middle-of-the-night diaper changes far easier since everything is in one place. It’s JPMA-certified as well. What the parents say: While some reviews note the long assembly time, many seem happy with this crib and changing table. As one parent wrote: “It was easy to build and the instructions [are] so easy to follow. Everything fit where it was supposed to. The storage and changing table are superb.” Best Convertible Changing Table Comes With A Removable Topper So It Grows With Your Family Wayfair Little Seeds Monarch Hill Haven Changing Table Dresser Material: Manufactured wood | Dimensions: 36 x 47 x 20 inches | Convertible: Yes | Weight limit: 100 pounds (dresser), 30 pounds (topper) | Greenguard Gold Certified: No This convertible changing table looks pricier than it is, and it’s the ideal height while not being too wide. It comes with a 1-year warranty, anti-tip kit and built-in drawer stops, so it converts to a standard dresser once your diapering days are done. The changing table topper is sold separately and there’s also a three-drawer dresser option if that better suits your needs. The drawers could be a bit smoother, but we appreciate the gold pulls, as they allow older kids to access items and feel like they’re helping. What the parents say: “When outfitting my younger son’s nursery, I searched for a changing table that was stylish, practical, midsize and something that could last for years while not blowing my budget,” says co-author Lex Goodman. “Having purchased a similar looking option for my older son, this Little Seeds changing table dresser appeared to be perfect. While it did take a couple of hours for my husband to assemble, we were extremely pleased with the size, value and style of the dresser,” she says. Best Portable Changing Table Adjustable, Foldable And Ready To Move Amazon Sweeby Portable Baby Changing Table Material: Metal, plastics | Dimensions: 33.5 x 2o x 39 inches | Convertible: No | Weight limit: N/A | Greenguard Gold Certified: No This lightweight changing table folds up and slides into narrow spaces for more compact living situations. Thanks to the lockable universal wheels, it can also be moved all around the home or remain stationary, so you can comfortably change your baby in the nursery, living room, bathroom or wherever else. It includes two shelves, two side pockets, a storage basket and a hanging clothes rail, so you can easily reach diapering and clothing essentials. The fabric is waterproof and easy to clean off, and we love that the whole table is height adjustable up or down, with four locking heights and a frame suitable for parents 4-foot-8 to 6 feet tall. Given these specs and its mobility, it seems a particularly good option for the newborn days and for families planning to have more than one child. What the parents say: With an overall 4.5 out of 5 rating on Amazon, the reviews for this mobile changing table highlight its convenience and ease of use. “Wish I bought this sooner and saved my back. My baby likes being on this more than his bassinet...It also has huge amount of storage and holds a lot of diapers & wet wipes below,” says one parent.

Our in-depth nursery and baby furniture coverage includes shopping guides on everything from the best cribs to the best rockers and gliders. We also work to answer readers’ parenting questions, such as how to design a nursery and when to transition your child to a toddler bed. The authors of this article, Elizabeth Mitchell Kadar and Lex Goodman, as well as baby and kids gear editor Margaret Badore—are all moms themselves. We are journalists with in-depth product review experience. Our recommendations are consistent with the American Academy of Pediatrics’ advice on changing tables. We regularly update this article for freshness and accuracy. It was last updated in July 2024 by Goodman. We also consulted the following pediatricians: Dr. Adrianna Bravo is a board certified pediatrician, Fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Chief Medical Officer of Inspire Medical Group and a school health consultant; and Dr. Rebekah Diamond, a pediatrician and author of Parent Like A Pediatrician. How We Chose The Best Changing Tables To pick the best changing tables we interviewed pediatricians and spoke with parents across the country to find the best options on the market. We look for baby gear that’s safe, helpful and practical in different use-cases. As parents of young children with a total of five combined kids between the authors, we drew on our firsthand knowledge of using changing tables. We read online reviews to garner more feedback from real families and experts. We also connected with parents in our personal and online communities to provide additional feedback. We only considered changing tables with overwhelmingly positive reviews and an average star rating of 4 or above. We made sure to adhere to the American Academy of Pediatrics’ guidelines on changing tables. After looking through reviews and discussing these items with parents, we determine if an item should be included. We selected changing tables that meet the needs of a wide range of little ones, including options for different budges, design style and taste. What Is The Safest Changing Table? Bravo says purchasing a safe changing table partly comes down to where you plan to place it. Ideally, parents should place the changing table in a “space free from anything the baby can grab or become entangled in” and be mindful about having supplies close at hand, so you aren’t leaving baby unattended while you grab another diaper. “Simply put, parents need to keep three words in mind while shopping for a changing table: safety, storage and hygiene. Once you meet those three criteria, the rest is up to personal preference,” she says. Bravo also points out that it’s ideal to look for a changing table or pad with raised sides or guardrails to minimize baby rolling off. We’ve also noted which changing tables on this list come with anti-tip kits and other important safety features, such as drawers that won’t tumble out or all at once, as well as those certified to be free of certain chemicals and off-gassing. If your changing table has wheels, keep them locked while not moving the table to prevent accidents. Is It Worth Buying A Changing Table? Most parents find worthwhile to have a designated changing table, which you can stock with diapers, wipes, diaper cream, changes of clothing and even small toys to entertain your child while you clean them up. Dr. Rebekah Diamond, pediatrician and author of Parent Like A Pediatrician, also notes that a changing table is helpful from a convenience standpoint, “since you don’t have to bend down or move around a changing surface.” Changing your baby on the floor or a bed can be hard on your back and shoulders. “There’s definitely an appeal from a nursery design and aesthetics perspective which is totally okay,” she says. Of course, you can turn any sturdy dresser of the appropriate height into a changing table with the addition of a changing pad. However, it’s important to make sure the piece of furniture you choose can support your baby’s weight. Changing tables that are designed explicitly for use with babies (like those on this lista) have the advantage of coming with the manufacturer’s recommended weight limit. Bravo notes that a changing table can also help establish a routine for parents and babies. “A changing table will be where parents change diapers, prepare the baby for bath time and dress the baby,” she says. “Regularity can be essential to create a soothing daily routine.” It’s also a more hygienic option than diaper changes on the bedding or rug, she points out. However, many of us are short on space or constrained by budget concerns, especially when considering all the stuff suggested to stock a nursery for your baby’s first year of life. That’s why a changing table/dresser combination might deliver the most value for your family, or you may prefer a more inexpensive, temporary solution for use just during the busiest of diaper seasons: the first year. The key is to consider your space and individual family’s needs. Do Changing Tables Need Straps? While not all changing tables and changing pads include straps, they are a helpful safety tool to reduce the risk of a baby rolling off the changing table. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics’ advice, parents and caretakers should “always supervise their child on a changing table, even when buckled.” They also note that “the changing table should have a guardrail around all sides, and the top should be slightly lower than the sides. Keep diapering supplies within your reach but away from your baby’s reach. Place babies to sleep in a safe sleep environment, not on a changing table.” If your changing table doesn’t include a changing strap (and even if it does), it's best to follow the advice of Dr. Bravo and “make it a standard practice always to keep one hand on the baby” when they’re on the changing table. Consider keeping a stocked diaper caddy close at hand on your changing table, so you have everything you need right there.",

Are Subscription Boxes For Women Ever Worth It? It depends on your budget and lifestyle. For those who have the extra income and want the convenience of getting personalized, curated items delivered right to their door, subscription boxes may be worth the investment. Many subscription boxes—like Ipsy’s Makeup And Beauty Subscription and Firstleaf’s Wine Club—also provide several full-sized items from your favorite brands (ones you might buy individually at different retailers) in one package at a considerable discount. Still, it might be hard for some people to justify the recurring costs associated with subscription boxes—unless they purchase them as gifts. Luckily, several companies—including Scentbird, The Bouqs and Trade Coffee—allow you to prepay for several months’ worth of boxes. That way, you won’t be on the hook for a recurring charge and your recipient gets to enjoy a gift that keeps on giving. What Is The Average Price Of Subscription Boxes? Subscription boxes for women average anywhere from $10 to $100 per box or shipment—though price varies greatly depending on the type of goods each contains. On the lower end of the cost spectrum, for instance, you can sign up for a plant subscription from Succulent Box for as low as $5 a month or a small-batch candle box from Vellabox starting at $12 a month. On the other hand, gourmet chocolates from Compartés cost at least $49.60 per shipment, while each box of luxury fashion and beauty items from Rachel Zoe’s The Curateur Curation is priced at $112.50.",

                    "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The most comfortable slides are breathable, easy to slip into and provide enough support and cushioning so you can wear them for hours. After testing out a variety of pairs and interviewing North Carolina-based podiatrist Dr. Elizabeth Bass Daughtry, DPM, we determined that Oofos’ Ooahh Slide Sandal is one of the most comfortable slides out there. For a supportive pick, Lululemon Restfeel Slide scored high in our testing, as did Hoka Ora Recovery Slide 3. The most comfortable slides are breathable, easy to slip into and provide enough support and ... [+] cushioning so you can wear them for hours. ILLUSTRATION: FORBES / PHOTO: RETAILERS According to Dr. Daughtry, a slide with arch support, a deep heel cup and contoured footbed can make all the difference for longterm comfort. Super flat styles that don’t support the foot can lead to pain and other issues. Based on our firsthand testing, we found the most comfortable slides whether you’re running errands, going on short walks or just lounging at home. Most Comfortable Slides Overall: Oofos Ooahh Slide Sandal Most Comfortable Foam Slides: Crocs Mellow Reovery Slide Most Comfortable Lightweight Slides: Lululemon Restfeel Slide Most Comfortable Supportive Slides: Kuru Breeze Most Comfortable Recovery Slides: Hoka Ora Recovery Slide 3 Most Comfortable Platform Slides: Reef Cushion Bondi Bay Most Affordable Comfortable Slides: Adidas Adilette Comfort Slides Most Comfortable Stylish Slides: Birkenstock Madrid Big Buckle Most Comfortable Slide Overall Oofos: Impact-Absorbing And Easy To Wear OOFOS Oofos Ooahh Slide Sandal Our score: 10 | Sizes: 5 to 16 | Colors: 10 total, including Cosmic Gray and Navy | Materials: Closed cell foam This cushiony slide is frequently featured in our footwear guides—and for good reason. The Ooahh provides the right blend of comfort, support and impact absorption—37% more than other footwear, according to the brand. The foam technology cradles your foot while you walk which helps reduce stress on your joints. Dr. Daughtry is a fan of this pick as well, noting that “the overall arch support and thicker outsole offers more cushioning and shock absorption than other traditional, basic slides.” What our tester says: “These are like rocking chairs for your feet—they support your feet with heel-to-toe support, are easy to walk in and provided comforting relief the moment I put them on. After a long day of standing on concrete, wearing these slides made my tired feet feel energized and pain-free.” The arch support and curved sole encourage smooth heel-toe transitions as you walk. Becky Eaton for Forbes Vetted Most Comfortable Foam Slide Crocs: Envelopes The Foot With Cloud-Like Comfort Amazon Crocs Mellow Recovery Slide Our score: 10 | Sizes: 2M/4W to 15M/17W | Colors: 7 total, including White and Varsity Red | Materials: EVA As its name suggests, the Mellow Recovery Slide is all about relaxing the muscles of your feet, especially after a long workout or run. The extra-plush SoftRide foam has a sink-in effect and the raised dots on the footbed give a mini massage. Dr. Daughtry says this pair is an “excellent choice for water activities” since the foam is fully waterproof. Fit note: These have a roomy fit, so you might want to go down one size. What our tester says: “These are my house slippers, meaning I wear them pretty much all day long when I’m working from home. I have a history of plantar fasciitis and I’ve worn Crocs ever since a podiatrist recommended the brand. This slide style required no break-in time and helped heal any overnight stiffness. I also like how the cushy foam wrapped around my foot, and the open toe and side vents kept my feet from overheating.” The Crocs Mellow Slide has side air vents to keep your feet from overheating. Becky Eaton for Forbes Vetted Most Comfortable Lightweight Slide Lululemon: Minimal Design For An Elevated Look Lululemon Lululemon Restfeel Slides Our score: 9 | Sizes: 5 to 12 | Colors: 8 total, including Misty Pink and Burnside Green | Materials: Foam, rubber Thanks to a dual-density foam midsole and a padded, water-resistant fabric strap, the Restfeels aid in foot recovery with a chic, minimal silhouette. The heel-to-toe rubber outsole adds a bit of grip while the strap and molded insole help your foot stay in place when you walk. There’s also a bit of arch support to encourage proper foot alignment. What our tester says: “Comfortable sandals sometimes tend to be bulky, but these Restfeels are an exception. They’re not as supportive as the puffier cloud-like styles I tried, but the lightweight design and minimal profile make a quieter statement . The smooth upper and muted colors feel dressy enough to wear out to a summer dinner without looking too sporty. I did, however, experience a little sweating when I walked outside on a hot day and the matte strap scuffed up a bit in my garden, so I might prefer to wear these indoors.” The Restfeels have a smooth matte texture that can be dressed up or down. Becky Eaton for Forbes Vetted Most Supportive Comfortable Slide Kuru: A Heel-Hugging Fit Kuru Kuru Breeze Our score: 10 | Sizes: 5 to 12 | Colors: 4 total, including Jet Black and Caramel Brown | Materials: Full-grain leather Kuru commonly tops our comfortable footwear lists because of the brand’s focus on ergonomics and the Breeze doesn’t disappoint. With a cushioned heel, arch support and a dynamic sole that flexes with each step, this slide is designed to align your foot. If you have bunions or wide feet, fear not: The criss-cross straps and “overall wider fit accommodates toe and foot deformities,” says Dr. Daughtry. What our tester says: “This pair’s microfiber insole was softer on my feet compared to the foam slides I tested. The lining and leather straps felt soft and breathable, and sweating was not an issue at all. The deep heel cup and arch support—common design features for Kuru styles—made my feet feel hugged and supported. I also liked the slight elevation in the heel that gently stretched my foot, relieving my plantar fasciitis symptoms. My only worry is that the light-colored lining might be prone to staining with extended wear.” Everything from the deep heel cup to the soft living makes these slides comfortable and easy to ... [+] wear. Becky Eaton for Forbes Vetted Most Comfortable Recovery Slide Hoka: Foot-Healing Option Hoka Hoka Ora Recovery Slide 3 Our score: 10 | Sizes: M3/W5 to M14/W16 | Colors: 13 total, including Squash and Vanilla | Materials: EVA Regardless if you’re shopping for a post-race sandal or a comfortable option for everyday wear, Hoka’s Ora Recovery Slide is worth considering. It features dual-density technology, an injection-molded outsole and a sustainable sugarcane EVA midsole, not to mention Hoka’s famous metarocking sole. Dr. Daughtry also likes the “air flow vents for better breathability, good anatomic footbed and excellent cushioning.” This style also has the AMPA Seal of Acceptance, meaning a team of podiatrists agree this shoe promotes foot health. What our tester says: “Once I put this pair on, all I could focus on was how good they made my feet feel. The cushioning is slightly firmer than other styles I tested and the support level was just right, not too hard or too soft, especially when I wore them for multiple hours. The rocking sole, which extends well beyond the foot itself, provided extra protection against toe stubs and truly made each step a smooth experience.” The Hoka Ora Slide 3 has a countoured footbed and an oversized rocking sole. Becky Eaton for Forbes Vetted Most Comfortable Platform Slide Reef: Next-Level Cushion Reef Reef Cushion Bondi Bay Our score: 8 | Sizes: 5 to 11 | Colors: 9 total, including Fog and Black | Materials: EVA If you’re looking for a little height boost in your slides, Reef’s Cushion Bondi Bay do the trick. With a cushy foam sole that’s higher than some of our other picks, this slide is not only lightweight and flexible, it’s also waterproof. Many reviewers say these feel “like walking on a cloud” with a “super solid base,” but some felt unstable while wearing the higher platform sole. What our tester says: “While I like the ‘90s vibe of these slides and very cozy feel, I can see why some reviewers felt a little unstable while wearing them. The cushioning was very soft and my feet sunk in a bit, but when I walked my dog wearing these I felt a little rubbing on the top of the foot and a little wobbly since I’m not used to wearing platforms. I think these would be a fun pick for a summer party where you’re not going to be walking many miles.” The Cushion Bondi Bays give a height boost and a cushioned feel underfoot. Becky Eaton for Forbes Vetted Most Affordable Comfortable Slide Adidas: Timeless Style With A Touch Of Extra Comfort Adidas Adidas Adilette Comfort Slides Our score: 8.5 | Sizes: M4/W5 to M18/W19 | Colors: 24 total, including Core Black and Pulse Lime | Materials: Synthetic outsole, textile lining Adidas has been making sports slides for over 50 years and offers several variations on this classic silhouette. Over 12,00o reviewers have weighed in on the Adilette Comfort Slide, which features a hidden under-strap foam layer for added comfort, and is an “extremely comfortable” option with “superb” cushioning.” The contoured footbed is soft yet supportive and the EVA outsole has a bit of grip to it that comes in handy on wet surfaces. What our tester says: “When I first put these on, I felt immediate comfort with the cushioned sole and the extra padding on the underside of the strap. The squishy sole sinks in quite a bit underfoot and the support felt a little less adequate than some of the other styles I tried. This style is unisex and runs large, so I recommend sizing down. The extra width made my feet slip a little—while they definitely felt comfy, I did notice a little sweating and rubbing.” The Adilette Slide has foam channels under the strap for added comfort. Becky Eaton for Forbes Vetted Most Stylish Comfortable Slide Birkenstock: Chic Details For An Elevated Look BIrkenstock Birkenstock Madrid Big Buckle Our score: 10 | Sizes: 4 to 12.5 | Colors: 10 total, including Black and Soft Pink | Materials: Leather, cork, EVA Podiatrists commonly recommend Birkenstocks for their “contoured cork footbed [that] has an anatomic outline with excellent arch support, deep heel cup and a raised toe bar for the perfect fit,” says Dr. Daughtry. The addition of an oversized buckle amps up the style factor. The more you wear Birkenstocks, the more they form to your foot’s shape, and once you consider the adjustable strap that allows for a custom fit, you might just end up wearing these everyday. What our tester says: “Almost every style of Birkenstocks I’ve tried becomes a favorite and I can’t seem to take this pair off. It has a wider strap than the traditional Madrid sandal—to accommodate the big buckle, I presume—and the extra upper coverage actually made my feet feel a little more secure. I personally didn’t experience any rubbing or blisters with the soft nubuck straps, but some reviewers said they needed a couple break-in days.” The gold buckle adds a touch of elevated style to the classic Birkenstock sole.

The publication of this article was overseen by deputy editor Kari Molvar, who has written about fashion and lifestyle topics for over 20 years. This story was researched, tested and written by Becky Eaton, a freelance writer who has contributed to over 15 footwear stories for Forbes Vetted with a focus on comfortable and supportive styles. For this article, we tapped the expertise of Dr. Elizabeth Bass Daughtry, DPM, DABFAS, FACFAS, for additional advice on find the most comfortable slides. What To Consider When Shopping For Comfortable Slides Shopping for a pair of comfortable slides can time consuming since there are countless options out there. Here’s a few factors to keep in mind to narrow your search. Arch support: Ample support is important in slides, not just for proper foot alignment but also because of how sandals are built in general. A flat style without support could lead to the slide slipping off frequently. “Without being enclosed or hugging the arch or the top of foot, your toes must grip the sole of the shoe to hold it in place,” says Dr. Daughtry. “If the insole is anatomically positioned or the arch of the foot can hug the shoe, less toe contracture can occur.” Cushioning: Adequate cushioning is also key to a comfortable slide. “Many slides can be too thin and flexible and not offer enough shock absorption,” says Dr. Daughtry. If a sandal is too flat, your run the risk of pain or even worse, injury. Look for styles with cushioned soles that support the foot and protect your heels from impact as you walk. Outsole traction: An outsole with good treads is an important feature for comfort, grip and safety. “I think of shoes in comparison to tires,” says Dr. Daughtry. “Shoes are our ‘tires’ and when the tread of a shoe [isn’t adequate], you can skid of out of control just like a car.” In order to avoid a potentially slippery and uncomfortable slide-wearing experience, look for a rubber outsole with good traction. What Makes Slides Comfortable? Slides are a popular sandal option for their ease of wear and breathability features, and many people find them quite comfortable. Some slides also have water-resistant qualities that come in handy during summer months as you encounter sweaty feet and a variety of water-based activities. “As with many things, it’s important to wear them in moderation and for the appropriate activity,” says Dr. Daughtry. “If worn too much, [slides] will not offer enough protection in some circumstances—think hiking in the woods or playing sports—or arch support.” Bottom line: Slides are a comfortable and convenient option, but they should be worn for the appropriate activity to avoid potential issues like tendonitis. Are Slides Comfortable To Walk In? Slides can be comfortable to walk in, but Dr. Daughtry warns they’re not intended for long periods of wear. “Choose the appropriate shoe for the planned activity to avoid development of any issues with your feet,” she says. “Many wear slides for running errands or around the house, and as long as the shoe offers proper arch support and cushioning, [they] can be worn in moderation.” Are Slides Better Than Flip Flops? The slide versus flip flop debate is a personal matter; everyone has different foot shapes, specific needs and comfort preferences. “Depending on the insole of the shoe, in general slides can potentially offer more cushion and support than flip flops,” says Dr. Daughtry. “Many find that flip flops can be less comfortable because of the Y-shaped strap that separates the great toe from the smaller toes.” Some might prefer the between-the-toe strap, however, for added stability or to better accommodate toe deformities and bunions. It’s best to try on multiple styles and assess your personal preference, keeping arch support, cushioning and comfort in mind.

However, mattress protectors have gained a bad rap over the years—many of them aren’t breathable, trapping heat and making you sweat. The best cooling mattress protectors—like the Brooklyn Bedding Luxury Cooling Mattress Protector—are made with breathable, cooling fabrics but still also offer protection against spills. The best cooling mattress protectors shield against spills while keeping you cool. Illustration: Forbes / Photos: Retailers If you’re not sure which kind of mattress protector you need, this guide can help you decide. But if you’re prone to sleeping hot, definitely choose one with cooling properties. According to Dr. Robert Oexman, sleep researcher and the founder and CEO of Somly, “The mattress protector you use can impact your temperature and the ability of the mattress to work properly.” Best Cooling Mattress Protector Overall: Brooklyn Bedding Luxury Cooling Mattress Protector (Queen) Best Waterproof Cooling Mattress Protector: Bedgear Ver-Tex Mattress Protector (Queen) Best Budget-Friendly Cooling Mattress Protector: Coop Sleep Goods Ultra-Cool Waterproof Mattress Protector (Queen) Best Cooling Mattress Protector On Amazon: Slumberfy Waterproof Cooling Mattress Protector (Queen) Best Luxury Cooling Mattress Protector: Sleep Number Total Protection Mattress Pad (Queen) Best Cooling Mattress Protector For Kids: Nest Bedding 10-Inch Kids Cooling Cotton Waterproof Mattress Protector (Kids Full) Best Cooling Mattress Protector Overall Silky, Cool And Water-Resistant Brooklyn Bedding Brooklyn Bedding Luxury Cooling Mattress Protector (Queen) Materials: Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), TitanCool cooling technology and polyester | Depth: 14 inches | Features: Cooling fibers, water-resistance | Encasement style: Fitted sheet | Care instructions: Machine wash cool or warm, tumble dry low Pros: Made with cool-to-the-touch fibers Water-resistant Quiet Cons: May cause fitted sheet to slip off Not completely waterproof Brooklyn Bedding’s Luxury Cooling Mattress Protector is our top pick thanks to its cooling capacity, water-resistance and moderate price point. The protector contains TPU fibers that are hypoallergenic, quiet, water-resistant and breathable. It can also accommodate most mattresses with a 14-inch pocket depth, and has a silky, cool-to-the-touch feel. The protector isn’t actively cooling so much as it’s non–heat trapping—which is still an improvement over many other mattress protectors. So if you need a good mattress protector that helps prevent liquids from seeping on to your mattress but doesn’t make you warmer, this is a solid choice. What the reviews say: Most reviewers are perfectly satisfied with this mattress protector. One says, “Seems to help with cooling on these warm summer nights, plus it has very minimal padding.” Another states, “Fits well and is comfortable, does not hold in heat like others we have used before. Do not notice it is even on the bed. Much better than others we had before.” Best Waterproof Cooling Mattress Protector Completely Waterproof But Highly Breathable Bedgear Bedgear Ver-Tex Mattress Protector (Queen) Materials: Polyester, polyethylene, metallic with polyurethane laminate | Depth: 18 inches | Features: Cooling materials, “Powerband” grip, waterproof | Encasement style: Fitted sheet | Care instructions: Machine wash cold, tumble dry low Pros: “Ver-Tex” technology improves airflow through the protector to prevent heat build-up Powerband keeps the mattress protector in place even on adjustable bases Fully waterproof Cons: Slippery feel makes fitted sheet slide off More expensive than many other mattress protectors The Bedgear Ver-Tex Mattress Protector is a fully waterproof mattress protector—putting it a step above water-resistant mattress protectors in terms of protection against fluids and spills. (And yes, there’s a difference between water-resistant and waterproof—water-resistant materials may allow small amounts of fluid to seep through, while waterproof materials completely prevent fluid seepage.) Additionally, Bedgear’s proprietary “Ver-Tex” technology helps maintain breathability and airflow through the protector so it doesn’t trap heat. This topper also features a “Powerband” elastic band that helps it stay in place on your bed. What the reviews say: Reviewers are happy with the protection the Bedgear Ver-Tex Mattress Protector provides. One says, “First test of mattress waterproof barrier was a great success. Young grandchild had an accident and protector did its job.” Another says, “So far, no complaints. It does what is promised, keeping your mattress protected without the extra heat of other protectors on the market.” However, some reviewers say the protector is a little loud and that the fitted sheet slips off the top. Best Budget-Friendly Cooling Mattress Protector Cool And Fully Waterproof, Under $100 Coop Sleep Goods Coop Sleep Goods Ultra-Cool Waterproof Mattress Protector (Queen) Materials: Polyethylene, polyester | Depth: 15 inches | Features: Waterproof, heat-dispersing | Encasement style: Fitted sheet | Care instructions: Machine wash cold, tumble dry low Pros: Fully waterproof Crafted from breathable and cooling materials Made with certified OEKO-TEX Standard 100 textiles Cons: Makes fitted sheet slip off the bed May be noisy according to reviewers The Coop Sleep Goods Ultra-Cool Waterproof Mattress Protector is a budget-friendly option, clocking in at under $100 for all sizes from twin all the way to California king. And while it’s not the cheapest mattress protector money can buy, it’s also coming from a popular, highly reputable sleep company that’s produced one of our favorite pillows. Its poly fabric cover is woven in a way that allows the protector to breathe and remain cool, and is mounted on a fully waterproof layer. However, reviewers note that it makes their fitted sheets slide off the bed easily. What the reviews say: Reviews of this mattress protector are mixed, with most complaints attesting to how the fitted sheet doesn’t stay on the bed because of how slick the protector is. However, one reviewer says with regard to the protector’s cooling capacity, “It works. I no longer feel like there’s heat being generated underneath me.” Another says, “It did feel cooler than others.” Best Cooling Mattress Protector On Amazon An Inexpensive, Prime-Eligible Mattress Cover Amazon Slumberfy Waterproof Cooling Mattress Protector (Queen) Materials: Polyethylene, polyester | Depth: 18 inches | Features: Waterproof, cooling fabric, hypoallergenic | Encasement style: Fitted sheet | Care instructions: Machine wash cold, tumble dry low Pros: Inexpensive and eligible for Prime shipping Made to dissipate heat away from the body Fully waterproof Cons: Reviewers say it doesn’t stay cool Bunches up easily on the bed This Slumberfly mattress protector is the least expensive of our selections, and it could arrive at your door as soon as tomorrow with Prime shipping. It’s made of a polyethylene and polyester blend, like many other mattress protectors—providing a cool-to-the-touch feel and outstanding moisture resistance. However, reviewers are mixed on the quality of this mattress protector. Some reviewers say it bunches up easily, and one reviewer even says—after a spill—she discovered that hers was decidedly not waterproof. However, this is a good choice if you’re on a limited budget or looking to get a mattress protector delivered quickly. What the reviews say: Despite the negative reviews, many people are still happy with this mattress protector. One reviewer writes, “This protector keeps you cool and is of great quality. Now I don’t have to choose between sleeping hot or risk getting spills and stains on my new mattress.” Another says, “The first thing you’ll notice about this mattress protector is that it’s cool to the touch… Even after a full night’s sleep, the cooling effect of this pad keeps on going, reducing the ‘warm spot’ effect that disrupts your sleep and has you tossing and turning looking for a cooler spot in the bed.” Best Luxury Cooling Mattress Protector Waterproofing And Extra Padding With A Cool Feel Sleep Number Sleep Number Total Protection Mattress Pad (Queen) Materials: Polyester, nylon, spandex | Depth: Not stated | Features: Waterproof, antimicrobial, stain-resistance | Encasement style: Fitted sheet | Care instructions: Machine wash warm with cold rinse, tumble dry low Pros: Feels cool to the touch Has antimicrobial and stain-resistant properties Adds a slight amount of extra padding to the mattress Cons: More expensive than other cooling mattress protectors Some reviewers say it’s not fully waterproof While there is a slight difference between a mattress pad and a mattress protector (and a mattress topper, for that matter), this mattress pad from Sleep Number pulls double duty. In addition to adding a little extra padding to your sleep surface (roughly half an inch), it’s waterproof, antimicrobial and moderately stain-resistant. Made of polyester, nylon and spandex, it feels cool to the touch, and the top of the pad features subtle ribbing that can help promote airflow. However, several reviewers have reported that the mattress pad isn’t actually fully waterproof. And like many other mattress protectors, it’s also slippery—making it difficult to keep a fitted sheet in place. What the reviews say: For the most part, reviews of the Total Protection Mattress Pad are positive. One reviewer writes, “Love the protection, plus it helps me to stay cool at night.” Another says, “Twelve years so far—absolutely perfect protection of our Sleep Number mattress. Not a single, even slight spot or stain on it. Washes well, fits well, adds a little extra padding to the bed.” Best Cooling Mattress Protector For Kids Low-Profile, High-Performance Nest Bedding Nest Bedding 10-Inch Kids Cooling Cotton Waterproof Mattress Protector (Kids Full) Materials: TPU, cotton, polyester, spandex | Depth: 10 inches | Features: Waterproof, cooling materials | Encasement style: Fitted sheet | Care instructions: Machine wash cold, tumble dry low Pros: Fully waterproof Comes in twin, twin XL or full-size Protects the sides of the mattress as well as the top Cons: Can’t read all reviews on the Nest website Who needs a mattress protector more than a kid? Between potty training, snack smuggling, drink spills and kid grime (if you know, you know), a good waterproof mattress protector like this one from Nest Bedding can save your child’s mattress from a slow, stinky and stained demise. As the mother of a hot sleeper, I also appreciate that this protector considers the child’s comfort in addition to the product’s functionality. It features a cool-to-the-touch TPU backing beneath a breathable cotton top. This protector is supposedly rated at a perfect 5 out 5 stars with more than 1,500 reviews, but the Nest website allows access to only a handful of the reviews. I’m a bit skeptical of that perfect score claim, but I’m sure that most people are satisfied with their purchase. What the reviews say: Based on the reviews I could access, reviewers are very happy with this mattress topper. One reviewer says, “Perfect for my toddler. Has protected the mattress after several night time accidents.” Another reviewer states, “Keeps my daughter cool while she sleeps. She’s usually a hot sleeper and complains in the morning, but she’s been getting great sleep.” MORE FROMFORBES VETTED The Uppababy Vista V2 Is $250 Off During The Nordstrom Anniversary Sale By Jordan Thomas Forbes Staff Here’s Everything You Need To Know About Prime Day Invite-Only Deals By Jordan Thomas Forbes Staff Why Trust Forbes Vetted The Forbes Vetted team has assembled a vast library of sleep-related content, including product reviews based on firsthand testing and buyer’s guides. The author of this piece, SaVanna Shoemaker, is an experienced Forbes Vetted contributor. She’s tested and reviewed several bedding products, like the best firm pillows and the best mattress toppers for side sleepers. SaVanna is currently pursuing certification as a sleep and recovery coach. Sleep editors Bridget Chapman and McKenzie Dillon have written and edited numerous mattress and bedding stories for Forbes Vetted. They have tested dozens of mattresses and other sleep products, and have both been certified as sleep science coaches. Dr. Robert Oexman, a sleep researcher, founder and CEO of Somly and “@thesleepprofessor” on TikTok contributed his expert insights to this story to help us select products and assemble the shopping guide. We periodically fact-check our articles to keep them relevant and make sure our recommended products are still in stock. This piece was last reviewed in July 2024. How We Chose The Best Cooling Mattress Protectors To find the best cooling mattress protectors, we sought out options from trusted brands, consulted with an expert and took the reviews of real customers into account. We leaned into the guidance we received from Oexman, who shared breathable and cooling mattress protectors he recommends. We also sought out highly rated products from respected and reputable brands. However, you may notice that some of these mattress protectors have mixed reviews and fairly low overall ratings. In order for mattress protectors to do their job effectively, they can’t be completely breathable or airy. If they’re highly breathable, they may not be completely water-resistant—and vice versa. By their very nature, even the best mattress protectors also tend to be noisy, crinkly, plasticky and slippery—not exactly a recipe for comfort or glowing ratings. Finally, we chose mattress protectors at a few different price points to make sure there was one to fit every budget. We also included a kids’ option—since children are arguably the demographic that most needs a mattress protector. What To Consider When Shopping For The Best Cooling Mattress Protectors Ready to shop? Here are a few key factors to consider when choosing the best cooling mattress protector for your (or your child’s) mattress. Materials Most cooling mattress protectors are made from polyethylene (PE) or polyurethane (PU). Both materials are lightweight, don’t trap heat, can wick away moisture and feel cool to the touch. These qualities make them ideal for mattress protectors. Cooling Technology There have been many advancements in cooling technology for mattresses and sheets, like temperature-regulating gel foams and phase change materials that dissipate your body heat. However, cooling mattress protectors have remained fairly simple. They are usually made with PE or PU that is designed to optimize breathability and water-resistance. The addition of extra materials could hinder their performance or make them too thick and padded. For additional cooling without adding a lot of extra bulk to your bed, Oexman recommends harnessing the cooling power of air or water. You can do this with a high-tech bed cooling system. Encasement Style There are two major types of mattress protectors. Standard mattress protectors go on your mattress like a fitted sheet. They don’t provide wraparound protection, but they’re very easy to put on and take off. Mattress encasements, on the other hand, are protectors that wrap entirely around the mattress and zip closed. They provide better protection against dirt, dust and allergens, but are a bit more cumbersome. All of the mattress protectors we feature above are the fitted-sheet style. However, if you’re looking for more protection against dust and allergens, you may want to consider a mattress encasement. Care One of the biggest benefits of mattress protectors is that they can be easily thrown in the wash, while your mattress can’t. Most mattress protectors can be machine-washed and dried, but it’s important to double-check the care instructions before you purchase—especially since some of these cooling protectors are made with specialty materials. What Is The Best Material For A Mattress Protector To Keep Cool? Most cooling mattress protectors are made from polyethylene or polyurethane. These materials lend mattress protectors a balance of waterproofing and cooling. Do Cooling Mattresses Work In A Mattress Protector? Mattress protectors are designed to keep water and other fluids from reaching your mattress. This has to limit breathability to some degree in order to provide fluid resistance. Oexman says, “A good passive cooling mattress can be limited if the mattress protector you use does not allow for air to move through from person to mattress or mattress to person.” Fortunately, most cooling protectors are made with polyethylene, which does a good job at allowing heat to pass through it as opposed to collecting. What Is The Best Mattress Protector For Someone Who Sweats? The best mattress protectors for people who sweat at night need to be breathable and cooling. For the most part, these protectors are made out of polyethylene or polyurethane, which pull heat away from the body, but still provide fluid resistance.

It’s wrapped in a specialty cover made of fibers that draw heat away from your body; it exudes a slick surface that’s soothing upon first contact. There are also layers of gel and copper-infused foams designed to regulate your temperature, along with a support core of up to 1,032 individually wrapped coils for plenty of airflow. With three firmness levels and a broader range of sizes than most sleep brands offer, you should have little trouble finding the right fit for your sleep preferences and space. (A 120-night trial is included, but you’re on the hook for a $99 fee if you return it.) If you crave a little extra plushness, add a 2-inch foam pillow top for up to $300 more. What our experts say: Senior sleep editor Bridget Chapman slept on a medium Aurora Luxe with a pillow top for several months. This was her main takeaway: “The Aurora Luxe is a really nice luxury cooling mattress. It’s a major benefit that it comes in three different firmness levels, so different sleepers can pick the right one for them. Its plush, lifted feel reminds me of a high-end hotel mattress, and I was really impressed by its ability to prevent me from overheating, isolate motion and keep me and my partner well supported.” Read more in her Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe Mattress review.

Best Cooling Mattress For Side Sleepers Side Sleepers Won't Break A Sweat On This Balanced Hybrid Helix Sleep Helix Midnight Luxe Mattress With GlacioTex Cover (Queen) Type: Hybrid | Materials: Foam and wrapped coils | Firmness level: Medium (5 to 6) | Trial period: 100 nights | Warranty: 15 years What you’ll love: Balanced feel for side, back and combo sleepers GlacioTex cover is effective at keeping sleepers cool Enhanced lumbar support helps alleviate pain Keep in mind: Stomach sleepers may find it too soft; check out the Dawn Luxe instead Lacks the sink-in sensation of an all-foam bed The Helix Midnight Luxe sandwiches its foam layers between a quilted top and a wrapped-coil layer where air can travel between the metal springs. The medium feel of the Midnight Luxe should appeal to most people, but we also consider it the best mattress for side sleepers for its mix of back-aligning support with ample pressure relief along the hips and shoulders. Many back sleepers should also appreciate its balanced feel and back pain sufferers benefit from the enhanced lumbar support. The mattress comes with a moisture-wicking Tencel fabric cover, but you can pay extra for a GlacioTex cover woven with thermal conductive fibers to draw heat away from your body for heavy-duty cooling. What our experts say: In her Helix Midnight Luxe review, updates writer Alexandra Garrett calls this mattress “comfortable, supportive and so cool.” (Her test model had a GlacioTex cover.) She adds, “Side sleepers, back sleepers and back pain sufferers should appreciate the bed’s excellent pressure relief and support. Hot sleepers can keep cool with the mattress’ GlacioTex cover and breathable hybrid construction, and combination sleepers can benefit from its slight bounce and lifted feel.” Best Cooling Mattress For Stomach Sleepers Cooling Comfort No Matter How You Choose To Snooze Leesa Leesa Legend Chill Hybrid Mattress (Queen) Type: Hybrid | Materials: Foam, coils, microcoils, cooling cover | Firmness Level: Medium-firm (5 to 7) |Trial Period: 100 nights | Warranty: 10 years What you’ll love: Balanced bed feel suits most sleep styles, especially stomach sleepers Targeted lumbar support Specialty cooling cover Dual-coil construction is ultra-supportive Keep in mind: Mediocre extras for the cost Only comes in one firmness level With a 13.5-inch profile, an inviting pillow top and a Euro-style gusset, the Leesa Legend Chill Hybrid resembles a luxury hotel mattress, but this new addition to the Leesa lineup is more than its good looks. Its medium-firm feel accommodates multiple sleep styles, and although there’s a sumptuous pillow top you can sink into, a dual coil system of nearly 3,800 pocket springs and microcoils gives this bed plenty of support and bounce so you won’t feel stuck in it. The cover is woven with phase-change fibers that Leesa claims help maintain the ideal skin temperature for sleep. (Not to mention, all of those coils help prevent heat buildup, too.) What our experts say: Dillon says, “The Leesa Legend Chill Hybrid is one of my favorites from 3Z, the parent brand of Leesa. It’s comparable to high-end mattresses that retail for $4,000 or more. There are only a handful of beds that boast two coil layers. Combined with its comfortable foam layers and fluffy pillow top, it’s an ultra supportive and plush bed that makes you look forward to lying down.” Best Organic Cooling Mattress A Breathable Blend Of Certified Organic Latex, Wool And Cotton Avocado Green Mattress Avocado Green Mattress (Queen) Type: Hybrid | Materials: Dunlop latex, coils; optional pillow top or box top | Firmness level: Firm (7), medium (6) or plush (4) | Trial period: 365 nights | Warranty: 25-year limited What you’ll love: Available in three firmness levels Made with organic, naturally breathable materials Also a good choice for sleepers with airborne allergies Keep in mind: Pillow top and box top upgrades are pricey It’s a heavy mattress, with no in-room delivery available Organic mattresses swap synthetic foams for latex foam, a naturally breathable material that’s just as pressure-relieving as memory foam and more forgiving toward sleepers with allergies. Our top eco-friendly choice for hot sleepers is the Avocado Green Mattress, which features a layer of Global Organic Latex Standard (GOLS)-certified Dunlop latex, over 1,400 pocketed support coils and a top cover woven with 100% organic cotton and wool fibers for breezy, supportive sleep. It’s earned a myriad of mattress certifications, including a seal of approval from the American Chiropractic Association for its 5-zoned ergonomic design to promote proper spinal alignment. The mattress has a firm feel (7 out of 10), but for sleepers who crave a plusher surface you can add a pillow top or a box top for an extra fee. Avocado offers a year-long trial period for you to test it out at home so you can experience how well it regulates temperature even as the seasons change. What our experts say: Contributor Jamie Ueda notes in her Avocado Green Mattress review that the breathable, temperature-regulating combo of cotton, wool and latex should help keep sleepers comfortable. “I noticed that if I lay in one spot for a period of time, some heat built up, but I didn’t get overly hot. When I moved, the heat quickly dissipated. I slept well through the night and didn’t wake up because I was too hot or cold.” Best Cooling Hybrid Mattress Purple's GelFlex Grid Delivers Cooling And Pressure Relief Purple Purple RestorePremier Hybrid (Queen) Type: Hybrid | Materials: Coils, GelFlex Grid and foam | Firmness level: Soft or firm | Trial period: 100 nights | Warranty: 10 years What you’ll love: Two firmness levels to choose from Coils and GelFlex Grid keep the air flowing Bouncy yet limits movement well Keep in mind: May not be supportive enough for front sleepers Hybrid mattresses are typically more breathable than their all-foam counterparts because of their coils, which help prevent heat from becoming trapped. The Purple RestorePremier Hybrid ups the ante by pairing its CoolFlex support coils with Purple’s proprietary GelFlex Grid for ample airflow, cushioned pressure relief and targeted support. It’s topped by a moisture-wicking SoftFlex cover with an antimicrobial finish for hygienic sleep. You find some foam here, as well — there’s edge support foam along the perimeter and a support layer of foam to serve as a foundation for the GelFlex Grid. Choose between a soft or firm comfort level; we recommend the soft version for side or back sleepers who like to sink into their beds a little deeper. What our experts say: Executive editor Dave Johnson claims in his Purple PremierRestore Hybrid Mattress Review, “When I went out of town for the holidays in the middle of testing, I was eager to get back home and continue sleeping on the RestorePremier. My partner concurred; it was excellent at providing support, motion isolation and ease of movement, while still delivering a superbly comfortable, soft and cushy feel. It even delivered great temperature control, keeping me cool throughout the night.” Best Cooling Mattress For Back Pain A Luxury Innerspring To Melt Away Your Aches Saatva Saatva Classic (Queen) Type: Innerspring hybrid | Materials: Pocketed coils, micro coils and memory foam | Firmness level: Plush soft (3), luxury firm (5 to 7) or firm (8) | Trial period: 365 nights | Warranty: Lifetime What you’ll love: Customizable firmness and depth Variety of firmness levels to choose from Free white glove delivery Keep in mind: Lacks foam so you won’t sink much here Costs $99 to send it back Suffering from a double-whammy of back pain and hot flashes? The Saatva Classic provides you with the salvation you need. This luxury innerspring hybrid boasts a dual layer of coils that cradles your body and keeps the air flowing. On top is a lush 3-inch Euro pillow top wrapped in an organic cotton cover to wick away heat and moisture. Specialty quilting, reinforced springs and a strip of gel-infused memory foam in the center of the mattress keep you well-aligned while melting away your backache. Surrounding the perimeter are dense foam rails for edge support. With three firmness levels (plush soft, luxury firm or firm) and two height profiles (11.5 inches or 14.5 inches), you can tailor the Saatva Classic to your liking. A 365-night trial allows you to test the mattress and ensure its temperature regulation is up to par, no matter the season. Free in-home delivery and mattress removal spares your back from further strain. What our experts say: Our former editor was a fan of her luxury firm Saatva Classic. As she says in her Saatva Classic Mattress review, “The temperature regulation of the Saatva Classic is absolutely top-notch. The only other option that might be able to come close in terms of cooling are all-latex mattresses. But when compared to other innerspring and memory foam options I’ve tested, the Saatva Classic is in a league of its own. If you’re a hot sleeper, I think this mattress is a great choice.” Best Cooling Mattress For Couples A Cool, Plush-Topped Mattress That Prevents Motion Transfer DreamCloud The DreamCloud (Queen) Type: Hybrid | Materials: Foam, wrapped coils | Firmness level: Luxury firm (6.5) | Trial period: 365 nights | Warranty: Lifetime What you’ll love: Cashmere-blend cover is luxe and comfy For a hybrid, it does an excellent job of limiting movement A great choice for back, stomach and combination sleepers Keep in mind: Feels firmer than advertised A little too firm for strict side sleepers For those who like to sleep cool, sharing a bed with another 98.6-degree individual isn’t ideal. But before going old school with two twin beds, take a look at the DreamCloud. A layer of coils helps promote airflow, while a gel memory foam layer, along with a quilted cashmere-blend cover, works to wick away heat. To keep your partner’s fidgeting and fussing from waking you up, the DreamCloud’s individually wrapped springs and multiple foam layers effectively dampen movement so you and your partner don’t wake each other up. Best of all, this luxury hybrid is constantly on sale. Combined with a year-long trial and a lifetime warranty, the DreamCloud is one of our favorite affordable mattress values. What our experts say: Alison Barretta, contributor and co-author of this story, says, “I sleep alone but performing multiple drop tests with a weight and an empty wine glass revealed how well the DreamCloud absorbs motion. The glass hardly moved, no matter how close I dropped the weight. I’m also prone to sleeping warm, but, like other members of my testing panel who tried the DreamCloud, I didn’t ever wake up sweaty on this mattress.” Best Cooling Memory Foam Mattress A Comfy Foam Pick Packed With Cooling Tech GhostBed GhostBed Luxe (Queen) Type: Memory foam | Materials: Gel-infused foam, phase-change materials | Firmness level: Medium to medium-firm| Trial period: 101 nights | Warranty: 25 years What you’ll love: Multiple cooling features including phase-change materials and gel-infused foam Medium feel ideal for side, back and combination sleepers Generous 25-year limited warranty Keep in mind: May be too soft for stomach sleepers Heavy sleepers over 250 pounds may want a hybrid The Ghostbed Luxe is Ghostbed’s most popular mattress, touted on their website as “The Coolest Bed In the World.” Although it’s made of memory foam and lacks the breathability of an innerspring, hybrid or latex bed, the Ghostbed Luxe is packed with cooling features that assist with temperature regulation. The outer layers of the bed consist of a cooling cover made with temperature-regulating fibers and a layer of gel memory foam, which helps to pull heat away from your body. Beneath the cover is a “Ghost Ice” layer, which is made of phase change material that can absorb heat and dissipate it away from your body and the base of the mattress. This helps keep the mattress from warming up throughout the night. Additionally, Ghostbed offers a 25-year limited warranty on this mattress, which is rare for a foam bed and speaks to its durability. What the reviews say: One reviewer writes, “We were surprised at the structure of this mattress and how much support it gives. No sinking like an old school memory foam mattress.” Another says, “While I wouldn’t say this is the coolest mattress in the world, because it’s all foam that would be a tough feat, I can say it’s by far the coolest memory foam mattress I’ve owned.” Best Luxury Cooling Mattress A Smart Bed That Reacts To Your Body Temperature Sleep Number Sleep Number Climate360 (Queen) Type: Hybrid | Materials: Foam, wrapped coils, thermal layer and microsensors | Firmness level: Adjustable | Trial period: 100 nights | Warranty: 15 years What you’ll love: Dual climate controls and firmness settings Feature-rich adjustable smart base included Tracks your sleep so you can identify trends Accommodates all sleeping positions Keep in mind: Expensive, even when it’s on sale Requires Wi-Fi to run effectively Sleep Number makes some of the most feature-rich luxury mattresses on the market. According to the brand, its Climate360 smart mattress is the only bed of its kind in the world since it actively cools and warms in response to your body temperature. Better yet, there are dual climate controls and adjustable firmness levels—if you and your partner have different preferences, this allows you to sleep in the same bed in peace. Built into the Climate360 are discreet microsensors that track your key vitals (heart rate, movement and sleep cycles) to deliver a Sleep Score, which you can pull up in the Sleep Number companion app. You can use this data to hack your sleep and create better habits. What our experts say: In her Sleep Number Climate360 Review, sleep editor McKenzie Dillon says, “Hot and cold sleepers should really enjoy this bed, especially if your needs are different than your partner’s. The cooling function is unlike anything I’ve seen on another mattress, and I found it to be very effective in my testing. The same goes for the warming feature.” As for its adjustable firmness, she adds, “The left and right side of the bed function independently of one another, giving you and your partner the ability to customize each side with the firmness levels you prefer.” Tempur-Pedic Promo Codes | 30% Off In April 2024 Best Affordable Cooling Memory Foam Mattress Snag A Queen Mattress Plus Free Bedding For Under $700 Cocoon by Sealy Cocoon Chill Mattress (Queen) Type: Foam (also available as a hybrid) | Materials: Cooling cover, foam and coils (hybrid) | Firmness level: Medium (6) | Trial period: 100 nights | Warranty: 10 years What you’ll love: Cooling comfort at an affordable price Ideal for side, back and combination sleepers Keep in mind: For cooler sleep, choose the hybrid May be too firm for some side sleepers The Cocoon Chill from Sealy is one of the best mattresses under $1,000—especially when you consider how pricey specialty cooling mattresses can be. Temperature regulation is aided in large part by a top cover woven with phase change materials (PCM) that are designed to draw away heat and wick away moisture, according to the company. But it doesn’t stop there—the mattress also contains a layer of breathable “Perfect Fit” memory foam that contours your body without leaving you stifled. If you want a bit more bounce and even better airflow, a hybrid version is available, as well (and yes, it’s still affordable). A perpetual 35% off sale keeps the Cocoon Chill firmly in the budget bracket, and if that weren’t enough it comes with a free bedding bundle of sheets and pillows, too. What our experts say: Barretta says, “Although the cover isn’t cool to the touch as advertised, the Cocoon Chill still did a respectable job of keeping me comfortable. Even when I battled a brief fever, I didn’t wake up terribly hot and sticky. If you want more enhanced temperature regulation, I’d suggest opting for the hybrid version—but for most people, the base-level Cocoon Chill mattress gets the job done.” Best Firm Cooling Mattress The Coolest Tempur-Pedic Mattress Ever Made Tempur-Pedic Tempur-Breeze LuxeBreeze (Queen) Type: Foam or hybrid | Materials: Tempur Material, cooling cover and coils (hybrid) | Firmness level: Soft, medium hybrid or firm |Trial period: 90 nights | Warranty: 10 years What you’ll love: Machine-washable cover for easy upkeep Virtually no motion transfer Comes with free in-home delivery Multiple firmness options to pick from Keep in mind: Tempur Material causes resistance to movement Underwhelming extras for the exorbitant cost Firm mattresses are sought after for their incredible support but they’re also less likely to make you overheat since you don’t sink into the surface but instead feel like you're lying right on top of it. Add the cooling properties of the Tempur-Breeze LuxeBreeze and you'll hardly break a sweat. Available in firm, soft or a medium hybrid, the LuxeBreeze delivers Tempur Material's signature pressure relief minus the typical heat buildup. It has specially-engineered foams that absorb body heat plus a top cover that’s soothing to the touch and removable for easy laundering. Tempur Material also excels at limiting motion transfer so if you share a bed, your partner’s movements won’t disturb your sleep. What our experts say: Dillon says, “When you buy a Tempur-Pedic Mattress, it’s probably for its pressure relieving, conforming feel you’ve come to love about the brand’s memory foam. The Breeze offers that signature Tempur-Pedic feel with a temperature-regulating design and physically cool cover. I also appreciate how it offers different firmness options that appeal to a wide range of sleeping positions.” Best Cooling Mattress For Pressure Relief A Supportive Hybrid That Cradles And Cools Casper Casper Snow (Queen) Type: Hybrid | Materials: Phase change materials, aluminum graphite bands and memory foam | Firmness level: Medium (5 to 6) | Trial period: 100 nights | Warranty: 10 years What you’ll love: Phase-change materials and graphite bands dissipate heat Medium feel accommodates side, back and combination sleepers Zoned foam promotes relief and spinal alignment Keep in mind: Only available in one firmness level Some reviewers say the cooling effects are minimal The Casper Snow stays true to its name and is specifically designed to help hot sleepers stay cool. According to the Casper website, it can help you sleep up to five degrees cooler. This is thanks to several cooling features, including the Snow cover made with cooling fibers and a layer of phase-change material that helps pull heat away from your body. It also features three “Heat Delete” bands composed of aluminum graphite that help dissipate heat, and the coils allow for improved airflow and breathability compared to all-foam models. Additionally, the hybrid construction combines the support and structure of pocketed coils with conforming, zoned memory foam that boasts a medium profile—resulting in a cooling mattress that’s also ideal for relieving pressure points. It’s soft enough to provide ample give under the hips and shoulders but doesn’t compromise on support. What the reviews say: One happy review says, “I’m a side sleeper and this mattress has taken the pressure off my shoulder and neck.” Another says, “The mattress seems to pull the heat away from your body. Solid support where you need it, and you can move around without waking up your sleep partner.” MORE FROMFORBES VETTED I Went Hands-On With Samsung’s New Flip 6 And Fold 6–And One Wowed Me By Rebecca Isaacs Forbes Staff The Best Cooling Mattress Protectors That Also Protect Against Wetness By SaVanna Shoemaker Contributor Why Trust Forbes Vetted We have a growing library of mattress guides built upon the knowledge of sleep experts, hands-on testing and hours of thorough research. Senior mattress and sleep editor Bridget Chapman and mattress and sleep editor McKenzie Dillon are certified sleep science coaches who have tested over 100 beds and know exactly what mattress features and qualities best suit hot sleepers. Senior strategy editor Katie Simpson, sleep updates writer Alexandra Garrett and contributor and mattress tester Alison Barretta, refresh this story regularly to reevaluate our top picks and offer the latest shopping advice. Forbes vetted contributor SaVanna Shoemaker last updated this article in July 2024, adding additional information in the shopping guide. She also added the Casper Snow mattress to the rankings, and replaced the Nectar Premier Mattress with the GhostBed Luxe as the best memory foam option. How We Chose The Best Cooling Mattresses To create this list, we first evaluated which mattresses from highly regarded brands offer cooling features for hot sleepers. We then put many of these mattresses to the test (often in our own homes), paying special attention to the mattress’s construction and any additional cooling features (like gel-infused foams or specialty covers). Beds made with a coil base took priority since this type of design tends to sleep the coolest, although there are some all-foam options on this list if that’s your preference. Each bed also had to offer a trial period with a seamless return policy and exceptional customer reviews, particularly from habitually hot sleepers. Of course, cooling ability played a substantial role in making our selections. However, we also considered other essential benefits—for example, pressure relief, support along key areas and low motion transfer for co-sleepers who share a bed with a fidgety partner. What To Consider When Buying A Cooling Mattress Since waking up hot is a common issue, many top mattress brands have worked to redesign their beds for increased breathability and temperature regulation. Here’s what you should look for when buying a cooling mattress. Mattress Type And Construction Mattresses come in many different constructions, the four most common being: hybrid, innerspring, latex and memory foam. Each of these mattress types offers a different combination of support, comfort and cooling abilities. Innerspring mattresses promote the most airflow out of any other type due to the empty spaces between the coils. These beds also tend to be more supportive, bouncy and firm than other mattress types. Hybrid mattresses typically have a breathable coil base with comfort layers on top. This results in a best-of-both-worlds mattress construction where you can enjoy the added comfort of memory foam without the heat-trapping effects. Some hybrid beds use gel- or copper-infused foams, which enhance the bed’s cooling abilities. Latex mattresses retain less heat than memory foam beds due to the naturally breathable structure. Natural latex such as Dunlop and Talalay is also usually aerated, which promotes a ton of airflow and breathability. Memory foam mattresses provide a marshmallowy feel that hugs your body. While this level of contouring is great for pressure relief, it often leaves sleepers feeling hot since the material retains heat. If you sleep hot but love the feel of an all-foam bed, some elements to look for are ventilated foam, foam infused with gel or copper (which help break up heat retention), and covers woven with breathable fibers or phase change materials. That said, a cooling memory foam usually still sleeps warmer than a hybrid, latex or innerspring mattress. So if sleeping cool is a top concern of yours, we recommend opting for a more breathable mattress type when possible. Additional Cooling Features Some mattresses come with additional cooling features, such as a cool-to-the-touch cover, a cooling pillow top or layers of gel or copper-infused foams. These features can either enhance a bed’s already-breathable construction or help a mattress that usually sleeps more warm (like a memory foam bed) sleep cooler instead. Here are a few added cooling features you may expect to see in these mattresses: “Cool-to-the-touch” textiles: Phase-change materials (PCM) can be used to create materials that feel cool against the skin. These are used in the covers and layers of cooling mattresses or offered as optional upgrades. Gel-infused foam: Gel-infused foams are a common feature in cooling mattresses, as the gel helps absorb body heat and dissipate it. However, one drawback is that gel infusions can lose their cooling properties over time. Air channels: Mattresses that include air channels, like hybrid or innerspring mattresses and mattresses made with perforated latex, are naturally more breathable than memory or poly foam beds. Copper or graphite: You may also see other additions, like copper or graphite, in cooling mattresses. Copper and graphite are conductors of heat, and can draw body heat away from your body for a more comfortable rest. Firmness Firmness is important whether you’re looking for a cooling mattress or not, but it also plays a role in how warm or cool a bed feels. The softer a bed is, the more you sink into it, which means your body retains more heat. Firmer beds, by contrast, tend to seem cooler since you’re on top of the mattress, not in it. Medium-firm picks hit the sweet spot of both for a comfortable, supportive feel. External Factors Your mattress alone won’t dictate how hot you sleep. The sheets you dress your mattress in, the pajamas you wear and the overall environment of your bedroom also impact your sleep temperature. (Look for breathable, moisture-wicking materials like cotton, linen or bamboo viscose.) Keep an eye on the thermostat, too. Ideally, your bedroom temperature should be anywhere from the low 60s to the high 60s. If you share a bed with a partner or your pets, you’ll naturally sleep warmer than you do solo. Other factors that may contribute to overheating at night include certain medications, health conditions, diet, late-night alcohol consumption and exercising too close to bedtime. Body Type You want to consider your body type when shopping for a new cooling mattress. Larger people may sink into softer mattresses—which can lead to excess heat. In general, the more you weigh, the softer a bed feels. If you have a larger body, you may want to consider a mattress that’s on the firmer side to help prevent this. Many of the best mattresses for heavy people have built-in cooling features and are made to accommodate more weight. They also last longer than mattresses designed for petite to average-sized people. Sleeping Position Back and stomach sleepers, in particular, may want to choose a firmer mattress to prevent their body from sinking into the bed and promote proper spinal alignment. Side sleepers should consider a softer cooling mattress that offers ample cushion underneath the shoulder and hip pressure points. Cooling Tips For Hot Sleepers A cooling mattress can do wonders for your sleep quality, but there are other cooling sleep products you can use to ensure you don’t furiously kick your covers off in a heated rage every night. Maintain A Cool, Dark Environment With Blackout Curtains Amazon Sun Zero Nordic 2-Pack Theater Grade Blackout Grommet Blackout curtains not only block light, but they can also keep your bedroom several degrees cooler by keeping the heat out. They’re particularly useful for summertime when the days are longer and hotter. These blackout panels from Amazon come in a wide range of colors and sizes. Invest In Breathable Bedding Sleep Number Sleep Number True Temp Sheet Set (Queen) When it comes to bedding, look for breathable materials like cotton, linen and bamboo viscose. Alternatively, you can opt for specialty cooling sheets. This set from Sleep Number has volcanic minerals embedded into the fabric to regulate your body temperature so you’re not too hot or cold. Don't Forget About Your Pajamas Cozy Earth Cozy Earth Short Sleeve Bamboo Pajama Set Upgrade your old sweats-and-tee combo with a pair of lightweight, breathable pajamas. This 2-piece set from Cozy Earth is made from stretch-knit bamboo viscose, which is known for its moisture-wicking properties. (Alternatively, you can sleep in the nude to prevent yourself from overheating at night—just be mindful of the risks.) Add A Cooling Mattress Topper Amazon Pure Green 100% Natural Latex Mattress Topper (2-Inch Queen) If your mattress sleeps too warm but is otherwise in fine shape, a mattress topper can be a quick fix solution to ward those night sweats away. This natural latex topper from Pure Green has ventilation holes to aid airflow and comes in a broad range of height and size options. (Bonus: latex is one of the most durable and breathable materials you can sleep on.) What Mattress Types Sleep Cool At Night? Hybrid mattresses and innerspring mattresses sleep coolest at night. Because they have a layer of pocketed coils or springs, air flows through them more freely instead of getting trapped in the layers. Are Cooling Mattresses Worth It? Yes, it’s safe to say the cooling mattresses that work are worth the money. These mattresses incorporate phase change materials (PCM) that absorb and dissipate body heat so it doesn’t get trapped in the mattress like with traditional memory foam. They also have moisture-wicking, breathable covers that prevent night sweats and overheating. What Type Of Mattress Is The Coolest? Mattresses can have several features that distinguish them as “cooling.” A few notable features to look for include innerspring construction, cooling or moisture-wicking covers made from phase change materials, air channels built in to support air circulation and gel infusions to help reduce the bed's temperature.

                    "title": "Olivia Munn and John Mulaney Are Married! Inside Their Intimate Wedding Ceremony in New York (Exclusive)",
                    "text": "Olivia Munn and John Mulaney are married! The actress, 44, and the Saturday Night Live alum, 41, who are parents to 2-year-old son Malcolm Hiệp, recently tied the knot, PEOPLE confirms. The couple got married over the weekend in a simple, intimate ceremony at a friend's home in New York state, a source close to Mulaney tells PEOPLE. Only their son and a witness were in attendance. The news comes four months after Munn opened up in March about her \"terrifying\" breast cancer diagnosis. The X-Men: Apocalypse star was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer in 2023 after tests revealed she had luminal B — a fast-moving, aggressive cancer — in both breasts. “You realize cancer doesn’t care who you are; it doesn’t care if you have a baby or if you don’t have time,” she told PEOPLE in April. “It comes at you, and you have no choice but to face it head-on.” Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Munn underwent a double mastectomy followed by reconstructive surgery last fall. She had four surgeries over the span of 10 months, and in April 2024 also underwent a hysterectomy. During an interview with Vogue in May, Mulaney praised Munn's strength. “Olivia and I have been through a lot of things together in the past couple years,\" he told the publication. \"Just side-by-side, supporting each other through anything. And as her guy, I felt both scared and protective. Even with Malcolm in her lap and me there holding her hand, she was going to be physically fighting this disease alone.” Throughout her grueling treatment and recovery, Mulaney has been by her side. “It would’ve felt like climbing an iceberg without him,” Munn told PEOPLE. “I don’t think he had a moment to himself, between being an incredibly hands-on father and going to and from the hospital— taking Malcolm to the park, putting him to nap, driving to Cedars-Sinai, hanging out with me, going home, putting Malcolm to bed, coming back to me. And he did it all happily.” The Baby J comedian also kept her smiling. “It’s the best except when you’re just out of surgery and it hurts to move or even laugh,” said Munn. “I made him leave the room a few times because he would make me laugh too hard.” Munn and Mulaney's relationship was first reported by PEOPLE in May 2021. That September, Mulaney revealed during an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers, that he and Munn were expecting a baby together. “In the spring, I went to Los Angeles and met and started to date a wonderful woman named Olivia,\" he recalled. \"I got into this relationship that's been really beautiful with someone incredible. And we're having a baby together. I was nervous when I was about to say the news!\" The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now! After the pregnancy reveal, a source close to the couple told PEOPLE that they were \"extremely excited about the baby.\" The source added, \"They couldn't be happier.\" Hosting Saturday Night Live in February 2022, Mulaney opened up about his sobriety and sweetly touched on the arrival of the couple's then 3-month-old. “Life is a lot better and happier now,” he said. “He is a pretty cool guy for someone who can’t vote.” In November 2022, the pair celebrated their son’s first birthday. \"Just got back from celebrating ONE YEAR of the most joyful baby being in this world and in our lives. My son, my joy. Happiest Birthday Malcolm Hiệp! I love you so so so much,\" Munn captioned a set of adorable photos on Instagram of Malcolm, who was seated on Mulaney's lap and covered head to toe in cake and frosting. The following year Munn dedicated a sweet post on Instagram celebrating Mulaney in June. \"We love you Dada ? Happy Father’s Day!\" she wrote. Earlier this year, Mulaney showered Munn with love in his own tribute on Instagram Stories. \"My son has the most incredible mommy and he knows it,\" Mulaney wrote. \"It's the most loving and silliest relationship I've ever seen. Happy Mother's Day, Liv.\" The couple have spent time on the East Coast this summer as Munn shoots the upcoming Apple TV+ series Your Friends and Neighbors. Mulaney, who wrapped his live pop-up Netflix show Everybody's in L.A. in April, has continued his comedy tour. “We’re a really strong little family,\" Munn told PEOPLE in her April cover story. \"We’re really just there for each other.”",

                    "text": "John Mulaney and Olivia Munn are officially married! The couple tied the knot over the weekend at a friend’s house in New York, PEOPLE confirmed on Wednesday. A source close to Mulaney, 41, told the publication the the stars — who started dating in 2021 — had “a simple, intimate ceremony” attended only by their 2-year-old son Malcolm and a witness. The Post has reached out to Mulaney and Munn’s reps for comment. Mulaney and Munn, 44, sparked marriage rumors last month on Father’s Day. In an Instagram upload, the former “Saturday Night Live” star ate a baked potato next to the couple’s son, while wearing a silver band on his ring finger. Mulaney later deleted the picture and replaced it with a shot of him and Malcolm playing with bubble wrap on the floor. Earlier this year, Munn revealed that she had a double mastectomy amid a breast cancer battle. She also underwent a lymph node dissection and a nipple delay procedure and started hormone suppression therapy, which put her in a medically induced menopause. “You realize cancer doesn’t care who you are; it doesn’t care if you have a baby or if you don’t have time,” she told People in April. “It comes at you, and you have no choice but to face it head-on.” The “X-Men: Apocalypse” actress also praised Mulaney, who was by her side during the health crisis. “It would’ve felt like climbing an iceberg without him,” Munn said. “I don’t think he had a moment to himself, between being an incredibly hands-on father and going to and from the hospital — taking Malcolm to the park, putting him to nap, driving to Cedars-Sinai, hanging out with me, going home, putting Malcolm to bed, coming back to me. And he did it all happily.” The new marriage is Munn’s first and Mulaney’s second. The comedian was previously married to artist Anna Marie Tendler from 2014 until their separation in May 2021. A few months before the split, Mulaney checked into a rehab facility for 60 days for substance abuse issues. He was an addict at a young age and first got sober when he was 23. Three months after leaving rehab, sources confirmed that Mulaney was dating Munn. They were seen together for the first time in June out to lunch in Los Angeles. Later that year, the couple announced that Munn was pregnant. Their son Malcolm was born on November 24, 2021. Munn opened up about her romance with Mulaney when she was pregnant. “It’s definitely not foreign for me to have people speculate incorrectly about things and to have rumors run rampant in one way,” Munn told the the Los Angeles Times, regarding the gossip about the couple and the timeline of when they got together. “They think they know our relationship so well,” Munn added. “When in reality, they don’t. There’s no way anyone could know what any of his relationships were or what our relationship is.” Munn, for her part, previously dated Aaron Rodgers, Bryan Greenberg, Chris Pine and Matthew Morrison.",

The 44-year-old actress and the 41-year-old actor romantically linked in 2021. After their couple confirmation the two welcomed their son Malcolm later that year. Their relationship has gone through a lot recently especially with the X-Men: Apocalypse actress having revealed in March that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. “In February of 2023, in an effort to be proactive about my health, I took a genetic test that checks you for 90 different cancer genes…Two months later, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. … In the past ten months, I have had four surgeries, so many days spent in bed I can’t even count…surprisingly, I’ve only cried twice. I’ve tended to let people see me when I have energy, when I can get dressed and get out of the house, when I can take my baby boy to the park. I’ve kept the diagnosis and the worry, and the recovery and the pain medicine, and the paper gowns private,” she wrote in her statement. During an interview in May with Vogue the SNL alum shared, “Olivia and I have been through a lot of things together in the past couple years… Just side-by-side, supporting each other through anything. And as her guy, I felt both scared and protective. Even with Malcolm in her lap and me there holding her hand, she was going to be physically fighting this disease alone.” Though they are facing this health battle that did not stop them from celebrating their love. An insider told People the two had an intimate wedding in New York which only was attended by their son and an unnamed witness. Their special day comes shortly after Olivia’s 44 birthday on July 3 in which she shared she spent in a tent on Instagram where her son is heard saying “Happy birthday mommy” catching her by surprise and later responding to his mom with “I love you so much.” She captioned her birthday post, “what a year…Thank you for all the birthday wishes!!!”",

The couple’s two-year-old son, Malcolm Hiệp, and a witness were the only ones in attendance during their nuptials. Mulaney and Munn were first romantically linked back in May 2021.

And we're having a baby together. I was nervous when I was about to say the news!\" The pair announced the arrival of their son on Christmas Eve. \"My Golden Ox baby. Malcolm Hiệp Mulaney.

                    "text": "Kevin Costner‘s period Western Horizon: An American Saga — Chapter 2 won’t be riding into theaters on Aug. 16 after all. The film is being pulled from the release calendar after Horizon: An American Saga — Chapter 1 bit the dust in its theatrical debut late last month. After numerous discussions, Costner’s Territory Pictures and distribution partner New Line Cinema made the decision to switch-up their ambitious release plan in hopes of allowing more time to grow the audience for the first film. The first Horizon sports a $100 million price tag. As part of that attempt, Chapter 1 will debut in the home on Premium VOD July 16 in addition to still being available to watch in theaters. “Territory Pictures and New Line Cinema have decided not to release Horizon: Chapter 2 on August 16 in order to give audiences a greater opportunity to discover the first installment of Horizon over the coming weeks, including on PVOD and MAX. We thank our exhibition partners for their continued support as moviegoers across the US discover the film in its theatrical run,” a New Line spokesperson said. Added Territory Pictures in a separate statement, “The audience response to Horizon, and enthusiasm for seeing our story continue in Horizon 2, has been incredibly gratifying. Kevin made this film for people who love movies and who wanted to go on a journey. The support that we have received from film fans, and the theater owners, as they experience the first chapter of this saga only serves to reinforce our belief in them and the films that we have made, and we thank them for coming on board for the ride. We welcome the opportunity for that window to be expanded as we know it will only serve to enhance the experience of seeing Horizon 2.” A debut date for Max has not yet been announced. Warner Bros., New Line’s parent company, began notifying theater owners of the dramatic 11th hour change on Wednesday morning. Many cinemas had offered consumers the chance to buy advance tickets for Chapter 2; they will now have to be refunded. The Horizon series marks a major gamble for Costner, who put $38 million of his own money into Chapter 1 and funded the rest with the help of two mystery investors and by selling off foreign rights. New Line and Warners agreed to distribute and market the first two movies for a fee, with Costner ponying up for the marketing. Costner intends on making four films. Horizon Chapter 1, sporting a running time of three hours and one-minute, opened to just $11 million over the June 28-30 weekend. It was an alarming debut for the $100 million movie, which was hampered by a poor B- CinemaScore and tepid reviews (it has a 43 percent critics’ rating on Rotten Tomatoes). It tumbled 51 percent in its second weekend to $5.4 million for a 10-day domestic total of $22 million. Worse, it’s earned less than $3 million overseas. Chapter 2 likewise cost roughly $100 million to make. Costner’s team indicated last week that he intends to resume shooting Chapter 3 in August. Costner is known for his confidence, but even he shocked Hollywood when he announced he would direct for the first time in decades and make four Horizon movies chronicling the great migration West during the Civil War era. In April, Warner Bros. signed on as a distributor and announced the unprecedented plan to release the first two films less than two months apart. Costner was so invested, that he left his hit show Yellowstone amid his Horizon commitments. Costner believed his film would strike a nerve in America’s heartland — just as Yellowstone has — and while it indeed played best in the mountain regions, Midwest, South and South central states, it so far has failed to galvanize his fans or Yellowstone viewers to the desired degree. The marketing campaign crafted by Warner Bros. centered heavily on Costner, who toured across the country, as well as premiering the film at the Cannes Film Festival. The studio also leveraged sister companies that are part of Warner Bros. Discovery, including TNT sporting events and TCM. So far, there’s no word as to when Horizon Chapter 2 will return to the theatrical calendar. Warner Bros. and New Line did not pick up distribution rights to the third and fourth movies.",

                    "text": "The ambitious release strategy for Kevin Costner's multi-part Horizon: An American Saga franchise is being reconfigured. Chapter 1 of the epic Western, directed and co-written by star Costner, opened in theaters June 28 to a muted opening-weekend box office. On July 10, Costner’s company Territory Pictures and distributor New Line Cinema announced that Chapter 2 will no longer hit theaters on Aug. 16, as was originally intended. A spokesperson for New Line said in a statement, as first reported by The Hollywood Reporter, that the decision will \"give audiences a greater opportunity to discover the first installment of Horizon over the coming weeks\" on streaming. Horizon's first installment will be available on demand July 16, and will later stream on Max. “We thank our exhibition partners for their continued support as moviegoers across the U.S. discover the film in its theatrical run,” said the spokesperson. A new release date for Chapter 2 has not been revealed yet. Territory Pictures said in statement, “The audience response to Horizon, and enthusiasm for seeing our story continue in Horizon 2, has been incredibly gratifying.\" Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \"Kevin made this film for people who love movies and who wanted to go on a journey.

Chapter 1 debuted at the Cannes Film Festival in May. The Oscar winner told Entertainment Weekly before Horizon's debut in theaters that he didn't think so much emphasis should be placed on a film's opening weekend performance at the box office. \"If we put so much pressure on that, we're bound to be disappointed,\" he said. \"I'm really happy that Horizon looks like what it's supposed to look like, and that's the way it'll look the rest of its life. And that's really important to me in this process.\" \"Would I love that it would be highly, highly successful? Of course, I'd like that. My ego would like that; everyone would like that,\" continued Costner. \"But I am happiest that the movie that you and I are talking about looks the way I want it to look.\" Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 is in theaters now.",

The first movie in Costner's planned four-part epic Horizon: An American Saga bombed at the box office, only making $11 million on its opening weekend debut. It was expensive to make and largely self-financed by Costner. \"I’ll risk those homes to make my movies,\" Costner said of his real estate holdings in a press conference at Cannes in May. \"I want to leave those homes to my children, but my children will have to live their own lives.\" As Costner previously explained to Entertainment Weekly back in May, he's been wanting to tell the story of Horizon for decades. His son Hayes is even named after the lead character Costner plays. \"I just don't fall out of love with things I like. I am always looking for the next great movie,\" Costner said. The first Horizon will be available digitally on Premium VOD on July 16 and is still available to watch in theaters. A streaming premiere date on Max has not yet been announced. Advanced tickets already sold for Horizon 2 will now have to be refunded by theaters, according to The Hollywood Reporter, which was first to break the news.",

                    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — The August theatrical release for the second chapter of Kevin Costner’s ambitious Western epic “Horizon: An American Saga” has been canceled after the first film fizzled in theaters. New Line Cinema announced Wednesday that “Horizon: Chapter 2” will not hit theaters on Aug. 16 as scheduled. The studio had planned an unusually fast back-to-back release for the two “Horizon” films. But after the first chapter collected a modest $23 million in its first two weeks in theaters, the distributor pivoted. “Territory Pictures and New Line Cinema have decided not to release ‘Horizon: Chapter 2’ on August 16 in order to give audiences a greater opportunity to discover the first installment of ‘Horizon’ over the coming weeks,” a spokesperson for New Line said in a statement. For now, the release of “Chapter 2” will be marked TBD on the theatrical calendar. The first “Horizon,” which opened in theaters on June 28, will land on premium on-demand July 16. No streaming date on Max has yet been announced. The Hollywood Reporter first reported the shift in plans. The move is a humbling acknowledgement that Costner’s big theatrical gamble for his decadeslong passion project has failed to catch on with audiences. The first chapter of “Horizon,” which debuted in May at the Cannes Film Festival, cost some $100 million to make, making its path to profitability extremely challenging if not impossible. Costner put some of his own money into it, and has already begun shooting a third installment of what he envisions will ultimately be four movies. When asked in May about the movies hitting theaters in quick succession, Costner said, “The studio wanted to try that. I knew this was going to come out fairly quickly, like every four or five months. That may have been easier. But this is something they feel like people can remember the first one and it can tie into the second one.” Costner, who directed, co-wrote and co-stars in the films, had been trying to make “Horizon” for more than 30 years. While releasing the film, Costner confirmed his exit from the hit series “Yellowstone.” The ultimate destination of “Horizon,” he acknowledged, was always going to be on TV. “They’re going to break this up into a hundred pieces, you know what I mean?” said Costner. “After four of these, they’re going to have 13, 14 hours of film and they’re going to turn into 25 hours of TV, and they’re going to do whatever they’re going to do. That’s just the way we live in our life but they’ll also exist in this form. And that was important for me, to make sure that happened. And I was the one who paid for it.”",

The first part of \"Horizon\" underperformed at the box office. (Photo by Steve Granitz/FilmMagic) FilmMagic Key Facts The first two “Horizon” films were originally planned to hit theaters in quick succession: Chapter 1 opened in theaters on June 28, and the second part was planned to follow seven weeks later. Distributors Territory Pictures and New Line Cinema told The Hollywood Reporter and Deadline they pulled Chapter 2 from the release calendar “to give audiences a greater opportunity to discover the first installment of Horizon over the coming weeks.” The first chapter of “Horizon” is still playing in theaters and will release on video on demand July 16 and will eventually release on Max, though a streaming release date has not yet been announced. Some theaters had already sold tickets for Chapter 2, which will be refunded, according to The Hollywood Reporter. How Did “horizon” Chapter 1 Fare At The Box Office? The first “Horizon” film grossed a dismal $11 million in its opening weekend, a concerning start for the film that reportedly had a $100 million production budget—of which Costner said he personally funded $38 million by mortgaging his Santa Barbara home and deferring his salary from the “Horizon” films. Chapter 1 has grossed just $23 million worldwide after nearly two weeks in theaters, according to Box Office Mojo. What We Don’t Know When the second “Horizon” film will release, or how the delay will impact Costner’s plans to release four “Horizon” films. He is currently shooting the third installment. Chief Critics “Horizon: An American Saga — Chapter 1” failed to impress critics, earning a dismal 48% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes. Many reviews, including those of Slate and The Hollywood Reporter, said the three-hour film was too bloated, with many characters whose stories did not lead anywhere and whose relationships to one another are unclear. Key Background “Horizon” has been a decades-long passion project for Costner and marks his first project as a director since “Open Range” in 2003. He finally began production on the films in 2022, more than 30 years after he had originally conceived of the project, and the first chapter premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May. Cannes filmgoers gave the movie a seven-minute standing ovation, though Variety reported there were “scores of walkouts” and most critics gave the film a negative review. Tangent “Horizon” opened in theaters just days after Costner announced he would not return to his starring role on “Yellowstone,” the most popular scripted show on television that paid him north of a million dollars per episode. His dramatic exit followed reports that he clashed with “Yellowstone” creator Taylor Sheridan over scheduling, with Deadline reporting that Costner only wanted to spend one week shooting the second part of the show’s fifth season because of conflicts with his “Horizon” schedule. Costner later denied these reports in a GQ interview, instead stating he had a long wait for his “Yellowstone” scripts which left him little time before he had to start production on “Horizon.” Costner lamented the drama in an interview with People, stating he was “disappointed that nobody on their side... ever stepped up to defend what it was I actually did for them.” Further Reading Kevin Costner’s ‘Horizon 2’ Pulled From August Release in Theaters (Exclusive) (The Hollywood Reporter) Trouble On Kevin Costner’s ‘Horizon’: His Big Post-‘Yellowstone’ Gamble Could Go Bust (Forbes) Kevin Costner’s Big ‘Horizon’ Gamble Struggles With $4.1 Million Debut—As ‘A Quiet Place’ Hits Record (Forbes) Kevin Costner Bails From ‘Yellowstone’ Following Reports Of Behind-The-Scenes Drama (Forbes) Follow me on Twitter.

                    "text": "The second part of Kevin Costner’s big-budget Horizon saga has been pulled from its August release date after the first film underperformed. The first film premiered at the Cannes film festival in May to negative reviews, scoring a 48% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw called it a “handsome-looking but oddly listless” western. Both films, which focus on the exploration of the American west, carry a reported $100m price tag combined and after the first opened to just $11m last month, it has made less then $25m worldwide. The August release of the second film has now been postponed “in order to give audiences a greater opportunity to discover the first installment” according to a statement given to the Hollywood Reporter. “Kevin made this film for people who love movies and who wanted to go on a journey,” it reads. “The support that we have received from film fans, and the theater owners, as they experience the first chapter of this saga only serves to reinforce our belief in them and the films that we have made, and we thank them for coming on board for the ride. We welcome the opportunity for that window to be expanded as we know it will only serve to enhance the experience of seeing Horizon 2.” The first film was made available to rent in the US on 16 July and will be available on Max soon. Advance tickets had already been sold for the second film with refunds now being offered. A rescheduled date has yet to be announced. Costner is reported to have put $38m of his own money into the saga with two further films planned after the second and the third already in production. He stars alongside Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington and Luke Wilson. “I’ve lived with movies and what happens to them on their opening weekend,” Costner said to Entertainment Weekly after the first film opened. “If we put so much pressure on that, we’re bound to be disappointed … Would I love that it would be highly, highly successful? Of course, I’d like that. My ego would like that; everyone would like that. But I am happiest that the movie that you and I are talking about looks the way I want it to look.” The production of the films coincided with Costner’s exit from the popular Yellowstone TV universe, which he confirmed on social media after rumours circulated.",

                    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Gregg Berhalter was fired as U.S. men’s soccer coach on Wednesday after his team’s first-round exit from the Copa America flamed doubts he was the right person to remain in charge for the 2026 World Cup, a person familiar with the decision told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday because the U.S. Soccer Federation had not yet made the announcement. The person said an announcement was likely for later Wednesday.

Jürgen Klopp, Thierry Henry and Marcelo Bielsa are among those being speculated about as candidates to replace Berhalter, along with Jesse Marsch, Hugo Pérez, Pellegrino Matarazzo, David Wagner, Steve Cherundolo, Jim Curtain, Massimiliano Allegri and Mauricio Pochettino. Salary could be an issue. Berhalter earned $2,291,136 in 2022, including $900,000 in bonuses for the Americans qualifying for the World Cup and reaching the second round. A top-level men’s coach could put pressure on the USSF to increase the salary of newly hired women’s coach Emma Hayes. Just 23 months remain before the World Cup comes to the United States for the second time and the Americans play their opener at Inglewood, California, on June 12, 2026. The only competitive matches with the full player pool before then likely will be in the CONCACAF Nations League. Berhalter, who turns 51 on Aug. 1, was the first American to coach the national team after playing for the team at a World Cup. He was hired to coach the U.S. in December 2018 after stints with Sweden’s Hammarby (2011-13) and Major League Soccer’s Columbus Crew (2013-18). He led the U.S. to titles in the CONCACAF Nations League in 2020, 2023 and 2024 and to another with a B team in the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup. His players strongly supported Berhalter, saying he fostered a culture that bound the group. That support led to Crocker rehiring Berhalter five months after his initial contract expired amid an investigation of a decades-old domestic violence allegation that was brought to the USSF’s attention by the Reyna family, which was upset that Berhalter limited Gio Reyna’s playing time at the World Cup. A law firm retained by the USSF said there was no legal obstacle to bringing Berhalter back. His detractors cited lack of success against teams outside the region and struggles on the road against Central American rivals. The U.S. gained the region’s final automatic World Cup berth on goal difference, and it had the second-youngest team at the 2022 tournament in Qatar. The U.S. wasted a second-half lead in a 1-1 draw with Wales, tied England 0-0 and defeated Iran 1-0 to reach the knockout stage, where the Americans played poorly in a 3-1 loss to the Netherlands. Players exhibited a lack of discipline: Defender Sergiño Dest got a red card last November at Trinidad and Tobago for arguing with a referee and winger Tim Weah was ejected from the Panama match for punching an opponent on the head. U.S. coaches have not fared well in a second cycle. Bruce Arena led the team to a quarterfinal appearance in 2002, its best since 1930, then failed to advance past the group stage in 2006. Bob Bradley’s team reached the second round in 2010, earning him a four-year contract extension only for the USSF to fire him 11 months later after the Americans wasted a two-goal lead and lost to Mexico in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final. Jurgen Klinsmann replaced him and led the team to the second round of the 2014 World Cup, then was fired after opening the final round of 2018 qualifying with a 2-1 home loss to Mexico and a 4-0 defeat at Costa Rica. Arena returned and the U.S. lost at Trinidad and Tobago on the final day of qualifying, ending a run of seven straight World Cup appearances. While the new coach inherits players such as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams who have thrived with European clubs, goalkeepers Matt Turner and Ethan Horvath and Reyna have failed to gain playing time with first-tier teams. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hu",

                    "text": "The Gregg Berhalter era is over. Berhalter is out as the manager of the U.S. men's national team after failing to advance past the group stage at this summer's Copa América tournament, U.S. Soccer announced Wednesday. \"I want to thank Gregg for his hard work and dedication to U.S. Soccer and our Men's National Team,\" said U.S. Soccer President Cindy Parlow Cone. \"We are now focused on working with our Sporting Director Matt Crocker and leveraging his experience at the highest levels of the sport to ensure we find the right person to lead the USMNT into a new era of on-field success.\" Doug McIntyre of Fox Sports first reported the news. Berhalter's time at the helm of the USMNT has been controversial, to say the least. Positives included a number of big wins over hated rivals Mexico and advancing past the group stage at the 2022 World Cup. But the United States almost never beat top teams in the Berhalter era and has appeared to stagnate despite arguably having the best young generation of players in USMNT history, led by Christian Pulisic. That was compounded by the rough showing at the Copa América, a result that led to major USMNT supporter groups calling for Berhalter's firing. A tipping point had been reached. \"Our tournament performance fell short of our expectations,\" the United States Soccer Federation said in a statement at the time. \"We must do better. We will be conducting a comprehensive review of our performance in Copa America and how best to improve the team and results as we look towards the 2026 World Cup.\" There was also the fact that Berhalter was out of the job for six months in 2022 after his contract ran out, as the USSF investigated claims from Danielle and Claudio Reyna that Berhalter assaulted his now-wife, Rosalind, while the pair were in college. He was ultimately rehired in June 2023. And despite a number of supporters and pundits believing he should have been replaced far earlier than now, he also had his allies, namely among the players. \"I see no issue with the direction we're heading,\" goalkeeper Matt Turner told reporters after the Copa América debacle. \"When you have a fight like that on the pitch in every single game we're in in this tournament, it speaks volumes to how the manager prepares us.\" \"I believe we all have a comfort with Gregg and we all understand him and we've had him for a long time,\" Weston McKennie added. \"He's progressed the team very far from where we started off four or five years ago. I think the connection that we have with him is what's important, in having a coach that players that would run through a brick wall for him, players that listen to him.\" A new era for United States soccer is coming, as the country searches for the right manager to prepare the squad for the 2026 World Cup. It will be a crucial hire for the future of the program.",

Berhalter, who turns 51 on Aug. 1, was the first American to coach the national team after playing for the team at a World Cup. He was hired to coach the U.S. in December 2018 after stints with Sweden’s Hammarby (2011-13) and Major League Soccer’s Columbus Crew (2013-18). He led the U.S. to titles in the CONCACAF Nations League in 2020, 2023 and 2024 and to another with a B team in the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup. His players strongly supported Berhalter, saying he fostered a culture that bound the group. That support led to Crocker rehiring Berhalter five months after his initial contract expired amid an investigation of a decades-old domestic violence allegation that was brought to the USSF’s attention by the Reyna family, which was upset that Berhalter limited Gio Reyna’s playing time at the World Cup. A law firm retained by the USSF said there was no legal obstacle to bringing Berhalter back. His detractors cited lack of success against teams outside the region and struggles on the road against Central American rivals. The U.S. gained the region’s final automatic World Cup berth on goal difference, and it had the second-youngest team at the 2022 tournament in Qatar. The U.S. wasted a second-half lead in a 1-1 draw with Wales, tied England 0-0 and defeated Iran 1-0 to reach the knockout stage, where the Americans played poorly in a 3-1 loss to the Netherlands. Players exhibited a lack of discipline: Defender Sergiño Dest got a red card last November at Trinidad and Tobago for arguing with a referee and winger Tim Weah was ejected from the Panama match in Copa America for punching an opponent on the head. “Gregg has earned the respect of everyone within our organization and has played a pivotal role in bringing together a young team and moving the program forward,” Crocker said in his statement. U.S. coaches have not fared well in a second cycle. Bruce Arena led the team to a quarterfinal appearance in 2002, its best since 1930, then failed to advance past the group stage in 2006. Bob Bradley’s team reached the second round in 2010, earning him a four-year contract extension only for the USSF to fire him 11 months later after the Americans wasted a two-goal lead and lost to Mexico in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final. Jurgen Klinsmann replaced him and led the team to the second round of the 2014 World Cup, then was fired after opening the final round of 2018 qualifying with a 2-1 home loss to Mexico and a 4-0 defeat at Costa Rica. Arena returned and the U.S. lost at Trinidad and Tobago on the final day of qualifying, ending a run of seven straight World Cup appearances.",

                    "title": "USA coach Gregg Berhalter fired after Copa América failure - ESPN",
                    "text": "Gregg Berhalter has been fired as manager of the United States men's national team, effective immediately, the U.S. Soccer Federation confirmed Wednesday. The announcement comes in the wake of the team's poor showing at the 2024 Copa América, in which the hosts failed to get past the group stage after defeats to Uruguay and Panama. It was the first time in the Americans' five appearances in the CONMEBOL event that they failed to advance out of the group stage. It was also the first time they were eliminated from the group stage of a World Cup, Copa América or Gold Cup that they hosted. The hope had been that the Americans would use the tournament as a springboard to greater success at the 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. is co-hosting with Canada and Mexico. Instead, the performances at the Copa América revealed how little progress the USMNT has made since the 2022 World Cup. The decision to remove Berhalter was made by U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker after a 10-day review process, which included consultations with president Cindy Parlow Cone, CEO JT Batson, vice president of sporting Oguchi Onyewu and members of the board of directors. Sources told ESPN that the review process included Michael Karon -- who according to the USSF website is a member of its Professional League Task Force -- polling board members over the past few days to see where they stood as it related to Berhalter's performance and whether he should stay. \"I want to thank Gregg for his hard work and dedication to U.S. Soccer and our Men's National Team,\" Cone said in a statement. \"We are now focused on working with our Sporting Director Matt Crocker and leveraging his experience at the highest levels of the sport to ensure we find the right person to lead the USMNT into a new era of on-field success.\" Crocker will lead and has begun the search for Berhalter's replacement. \"We are deeply grateful to Gregg for his commitment the past five years to the Men's National Team and to U.S. Soccer,\" said Crocker. \"Gregg has earned the respect of everyone within our organization and has played a pivotal role in bringing together a young team and moving the program forward. \"We wish Gregg all the best in his future endeavors, and we know he will find success in his next coaching position. U.S. Soccer is committed to doing what is necessary to ensure our success on the pitch and we are dedication to fostering a culture that leads to winning. \"Our immediate focus is on finding a coach who can maximize our potential as we continue to prepare for the 2026 World Cup, and we have already begun our search process.\" The failure at the Copa took on even more significance given that as hosts, there will be no World Cup qualifying matches to help the team prepare for the tournament. The Copa América was the last opportunity for the U.S. to play competitive fixtures against teams from outside the Concacaf region. The only other tournament that the U.S. will participate in between now and 2026 is the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup. The upcoming September international window will see the U.S. square off against Canada and New Zealand. Expectations for the USMNT have increased since its respectable showing at the 2022 World Cup, when the U.S. reached the round of 16 with the youngest team in the tournament weighted by minutes played. Berhalter was re-hired as coach in June 2023 on a contract through the 2026 World Cup, following a six-month investigation sparked by a rift with the Reyna family. But since then the U.S. has struggled to show improvement. The USMNT barely got by Jamaica in the semifinals of the Concacaf Nations League last March, when an own-goal in second half stoppage time helped the U.S. escape with a victory in extra time. It also fell to Trinidad & Tobago in the second leg of the quarterfinals of that competition, though the U.S. progressed on aggregate. These results, taken together, have increased calls for Berhalter to be replaced. On the night of the U.S. team's elimination, Crocker, who wasn't present at the Uruguay match due to a long-planned family commitment, announced that a review process would commence to evaluate the performance of Berhalter and the team. Ultimately, Crocker decided to relieve Berhalter. Berhalter, a former U.S. international as a player, was hired in December of 2018, after having spent the previous five seasons with the Columbus Crew. But he was hired while his brother, Jay, was the chief commercial officer at the U.S. Soccer Federation, raising questions about a potential conflict of interest. Following the USMNT's failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, Berhalter set about rebuilding the team with a new generation of players, and a new style based heavily on possession. The results were uneven, but ultimately positive. The U.S. lost the 2019 Concacaf Gold Cup final to Mexico, and also lost during the group stage to Canada in the 2020 Concacaf Nations League. Thanks to an evolution to a more pragmatic style, the U.S. ultimately recovered to claim that title, as well as the two subsequent CNL crowns. World Cup qualifying had similar difficulties. The team ultimately qualified for the 2022 World Cup, though that wasn't secured until the final day of qualifying, with the U.S. finishing third in Concacaf qualifying on goal differential. Yet Berhalter and the team have failed to build on the promise of the 2022 World Cup, and now he finds himself out of a job.",

                    "title": "Judge says Rudy Giuliani bankruptcy case likely to be dismissed. But his debts aren’t going away",
                    "text": "By MICHAEL R. SISAK NEW YORK (AP) — A judge said Wednesday he was leaning toward throwing out Rudy Giuliani ‘s bankruptcy case after lawyers for the cash-strapped former New York City mayor and his biggest creditors — two ex-Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment against him — agreed this was the best way forward. The case has been roiled by allegations Giuliani is flouting bankruptcy laws and potentially hiding assets. A dismissal would end his pursuit of bankruptcy protection, but it wouldn’t let him off the hook for his debts. His creditors could pursue other legal remedies to recoup at least some of the money they’re owed, such as getting a court order to seize his apartments and other assets. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane said he plans to issue a decision by the end of the week. He scheduled a hearing for 1 p.m. Friday and could make his ruling at that time. Lane ruled out converting the case to a liquidation, as Giuliani had recently requested, saying that doing so would not be in the best interest of people and entities he’s indebted to. “I’m leaning toward dismissal frankly because I’m concerned that the past is prologue,” Lane said during a hybrid in-person and Zoom status hearing in White Plains, New York. Giuliani’s lawyer, Gary Fischoff, said dismissing the case would allow him to pursue an appeal in the defamation case, which arose from his efforts to overturn Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss. A lawyer for the former election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, accused Giuliani of using the bankruptcy process as a “bad-faith litigation tactic” and said “he regards this court as a pause button on his woes.” Lane scolded Giuliani at one point for interrupting the hearing. The ex-mayor, joining by phone, called Freeman and Moss lawyer Rachel Strickland’s comments — including remarks about his many legal woes — “highly defamatory, your honor.” Philip Dublin, a lawyer for a committee of Giuliani’s other creditors, said the committee would rather keep the bankruptcy case going with the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee. Giuliani filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in December, days after the former election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, won their defamation case. They said Giuliani’s targeting of them because of Trump’s lies about the 2020 election being stolen led to death threats that made them fear for their lives. Earlier this month, Giuliani requested that his Chapter 11 bankruptcy case be converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation — which would have seen a trustee appointed to take control of his assets and sell many of them off to help pay creditors. Reconsidering that idea on Wednesday and pushing for a dismissal instead, Fischoff noted that administrative fees related to liquidation would “consume if not 100%, a substantial portion of the assets.” If the bankruptcy is dismissed, Freeman and Moss could bring their effort to collect on the $148 million award back to the court in Washington, D.C., where they won their lawsuit, and avoid having to pay more legal fees for bankruptcy court. Lane said a dismissal would include a 12-month ban on Giuliani filing again for bankruptcy protection. Freeman and Moss, meanwhile, have a pending request before the judge to declare that the $148 million judgment cannot be discharged — or dismissed — during Giuliani’s bankruptcy. The bankruptcy is one of a host of legal woes consuming Giuliani. Last week, the former federal prosecutor was disbarred as an attorney in New York after a court found that he repeatedly made false statements about Trump’s 2020 election loss. He is also facing the possibility of losing his law license in Washington after a board in May recommended that he be disbarred. In Georgia and Arizona, Giuliani is facing criminal charges over his role in the effort to overturn the 2020 election. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases. When he filed for bankruptcy, Giuliani listed nearly $153 million in existing or potential debts, including almost $1 million in state and federal tax liabilities, money he owes lawyers, and many millions of dollars in potential judgments in lawsuits against him. He estimated he had assets worth $1 million to $10 million. In his most recent financial filings in the bankruptcy case, he said he had about $94,000 cash in hand at the end of May while his company, Giuliani Communications, had about $237,000 in the bank. A main source of income for Giuliani over the past two years has been a retirement account with a balance of just over $1 million in May, down from nearly $2.5 million in 2022 after his withdrawals, the filings say. In May, he spent nearly $33,000 including nearly $28,000 for condo and co-op costs for his Florida and New York City homes. He also spent about $850 on food, $390 on cleaning services, $230 on medicine, $200 on laundry and $190 on vehicles.",

The case has been roiled by allegations Giuliani is flouting bankruptcy laws and potentially hiding assets. A dismissal would end his pursuit of bankruptcy protection, but it wouldn’t let him off the hook for his debts. His creditors could pursue other legal remedies to recoup at least some of the money they’re owed, such as getting a court order to seize his apartments and other assets. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane said he plans to issue a decision by the end of the week. He scheduled a hearing for 1 p.m. Friday and could make his ruling at that time. Lane ruled out converting the case to a liquidation, an option Giuliani recently proposed, saying that doing so would not be in the best interest of people and entities he’s indebted to. “I’m leaning toward dismissal, frankly, because I’m concerned that the past is prologue,” Lane said during a hybrid in-person and Zoom status hearing in White Plains, New York. Giuliani’s lawyer, Gary Fischoff, said dismissing the case would allow the ex-mayor to pursue an appeal in the defamation case, which arose from his efforts to overturn Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss. Another alternative would be to have the Chapter 11 case continue while a court-appointed trustee takes control of Giuliani’s assets. A lawyer for the former election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, accused Giuliani of using the bankruptcy process as a “bad-faith litigation tactic” and said “he regards this court as a pause button on his woes while he continues to live his life unbothered by creditors.” “The question here is always going to be the cat-and-mouse game of what dollar can be funneled outside of the estate,” Freeman and Moss’ lawyer Rachel Strickland said. “Out in the real world, outside of bankruptcy, all dollars are fair game for everyone and Mr. Giuliani has to continue to live and do whatever it is he is able to do with his name, likeness and commentary in order to make a living.” Lane scolded Giuliani at one point for interrupting the hearing. The ex-mayor, joining by phone, called Strickland’s comments “highly defamatory, your honor.” Philip Dublin, a lawyer for a committee of Giuliani’s other creditors, said the committee would rather keep the bankruptcy case going with the appointment of a trustee. Giuliani filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in December, days after the former election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, won their defamation case. They said Giuliani’s targeting of them because of Trump’s lies about the 2020 election being stolen led to death threats that made them fear for their lives. Earlier this month, Giuliani requested that the case be converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation — which would have seen a trustee appointed to take control of his assets and sell them off to help pay creditors. Reconsidering that idea on Wednesday and pushing for a dismissal instead, Fischoff noted that administrative fees related to liquidation would “consume if not 100%, a substantial portion of the assets.” If the bankruptcy is dismissed, Freeman and Moss could bring their effort to collect on the $148 million award back to the court in Washington, D.C., where they won their lawsuit, and avoid having to pay more legal fees for bankruptcy court. Lane said a dismissal would include a 12-month ban on Giuliani filing again for bankruptcy protection. Freeman and Moss, meanwhile, have a pending request before the judge to declare that the $148 million judgment cannot be discharged — or dismissed — during Giuliani’s bankruptcy. The bankruptcy is one of a host of legal woes consuming Giuliani, once heralded as “America’s Mayor” for his calm and steady leadership after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Last week, the ex-federal prosecutor and 2008 Republican presidential candidate was disbarred as an attorney in New York after a court found that he repeatedly made false statements about Trump’s 2020 election loss. He is also facing the possibility of losing his law license in Washington after a board in May recommended that he be disbarred. When he filed for bankruptcy, Giuliani listed nearly $153 million in existing or potential debts, including almost $1 million in state and federal tax liabilities, money he owes lawyers, and many millions of dollars in potential judgments in lawsuits against him. He estimated he had assets worth $1 million to $10 million. In his most recent financial filings in the bankruptcy case, he said he had about $94,000 cash in hand at the end of May while his company, Giuliani Communications, had about $237,000 in the bank. A main source of income for Giuliani over the past two years has been a retirement account with a balance of just over $1 million in May, down from nearly $2.5 million in 2022 after his withdrawals, the filings say. In May, he spent nearly $33,000 including nearly $28,000 for condo and co-op costs for his Florida and New York City homes. He also spent about $850 on food, $390 on cleaning services, $230 on medicine, $200 on laundry and $190 on vehicles.",

Rachel Strickland, the lawyer representing former election workers Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, accused Mr. Giuliani of using the bankruptcy process as a “bad-faith litigation tactic.” The defamation lawsuit stems from Mr. Giuliani’s accusations that Ms. Freeman and Ms. Moss committed voter fraud while counting ballots after the 2020 presidential election. At one point, Judge Lane scolded Mr. Giuliani for interrupting the hearing.

The former federal prosecutor is also facing criminal charges in Georgia and Arizona for his part in challenging the 2020 election. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases. In December, Mr. Giuliani listed nearly $153 million in existing or potential debts, including nearly $1 million in state and federal tax liabilities. His assets were estimated to be between $1 million and $10 million. Recent court filings in the bankruptcy case state that his cash on hand was about $94,000 at the end of May.

                    "title": "Ex-NBA player Jontay Porter pleads guilty in case tied to gambling scandal that tanked his career",
                    "text": "NEW YORK -- Former NBA player Jontay Porter on Wednesday pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a federal criminal case tied to the betting scandal that got him banned from the league earlier this year. The former Toronto Raptors center entered the plea at his arraignment in a New York federal court and was set to be released on bond of $250,000. His lawyer had previously said that Porter was cooperating with authorities while being treated for a gambling addiction. Court papers showed the case against Porter is related to an ongoing prosecution of four other men. The four have been arraigned on a charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud but haven't yet entered any pleas. Those men are charged with scheming to profit off tips from an NBA player that he was going to exit two games early. They or their relatives used the knowledge to place big-winning bets that the athlete would do poorly in those games, according to a court complaint filed when they were charged in June. The complaint didn't name the player, but details matched up with an NBA investigation that spurred Porter's banishment from the league this spring. The league found that he gambled on NBA games and gave bettors confidential information about his health. In court Wednesday, Porter said he agreed to withdraw early from games to get out from under large gambling debts so he and co-conspirators could win bets on his performance. \"I know what I did was wrong, unlawful, and I am deeply sorry,\" he said. Porter is set to be sentenced Dec. 18. He could face from just under three and a half years in prison to a little over four years. He's also likely to be assessed hundreds of thousands of dollars in restitution, plus potential fines. According to the complaint, one of the four men pressed the player to clear up gambling debts by prematurely pulling out of games so that bets on him underperforming would pay off. In a message responding to the man's instructions, the player wrote that if he didn't carry out the plan, \"u hate me and if I don't get u 8k by Friday you're coming to Toronto to beat me up.\" After tipping off some of the men, the player claimed injury or illness and withdrew from Jan. 26 and March 20 games after only minutes on the court, the complaint said. Porter played only briefly on those dates before complaining he was hurt or sick and exiting the games. His points, rebounds and assists in both games fell below sportsbooks' expectations. After the NBA and others began investigating, the player messaged some of the men that they \"might just get hit w a rico,\" an apparent reference to the common acronym for a federal racketeering charge, according to the complaint against them. It said the player also asked the men whether they had deleted \"all the stuff\" from their phones. The NBA's probe found that Porter not only exited at least one game for gamblers' sake but also wagered on NBA games in which he didn't play. He once bet against his own team, the league said. Porter averaged 4.4 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 26 games this season, including five starts. He also played in 11 games for the Memphis Grizzlies in the 2020-21 season. The 24-year-old's NBA salary was about $410,000.

                    "text": "NEW YORK >> Former Toronto Raptors forward Jontay Porter pleaded guilty today to a criminal conspiracy charge over his role in a sports gambling scandal that earned him a lifetime ban from the NBA. Porter entered his plea to a wire fraud conspiracy charge at a hearing in Brooklyn federal court before U.S. Magistrate Judge James Cho. The National Basketball Association banned Porter in April, saying he violated its gambling policies by placing 13 bets on league games, including a bet that the Raptors would lose. Prosecutors charged four other men last month over their alleged roles in a sports gambling operation. Porter was not named in the complaints, but court records made public last week showed that he would face charges. The four men were charged with conspiring to defraud a sports betting company with “prop” bets, which are wagers on players’ performance, on two Raptors games where they had been tipped that Porter would leave early. Prosecutors said Porter played four minutes in a Jan. 26 game against the Los Angeles Clippers before saying he had an eye injury, and three minutes in a March 20 game against the Sacramento Kings before claiming he was ill. The men allegedly made more than $1 million on the games by betting the “under,” that Porter would not hit specified statistical targets. Porter had amassed significant gambling debts to one of the men, Ammar Awawdeh, who in early 2024 encouraged him to pay him back by taking himself out of games prematurely, according to the complaint. Awawdeh is free on $100,000 bail and has not entered a plea. According to prosecutors, Porter told the men in an April 4 group chat they “might just get hit w a rico,” an apparent reference to a song by rappers Meek Mill and Drake about anti-racketeering laws. Porter allegedly asked the men if they had deleted cell phone content.",

Jontay Porter C of Toronto Raptors fights for a rebound with Lindy Waters III R of Oklahoma City ... [+] Thunder during the 2023-2024 NBA regular season game between Toronto Raptors and Oklahoma City Thunder in Toronto, Canada. Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images Key Facts The former Raptor, who his lawyer has said struggles with gambling addiction, entered his guilty plea at his arraignment at a New York federal court and was released on a $250,000 bond, the Associated Press reported. Porter was given a lifetime ban from the league in April over the gambling scandal, with the NBA saying in a press release an investigation found he had disclosed “confidential information to sports bettors” and had limited his participation in one or more games for betting purposes. Porter is set to be sentenced in December and will likely have to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in restitution and potential fines and, though the charge carries up to 20 years in prison, Porter agreed not to appeal a sentence of less than five years, ABC News reported.

Crucial Quote At his arraignment Wednesday, Porter reportedly expressed remorse, saying, “I knew what I did was wrong and unlawful and I'm deeply sorry for my conduct.” Big Number $59,094. That’s how much Porter bet on NBA games—though none were games in which he played—using an associate’s online betting account from January through March, the league said. The total payout from the bets was $76,059, resulting in $21,965 in winnings. Key Background Porter played for the Memphis Grizzlies in the 2020-21 season, then played in the NBA G League before playing for the Raptors last season. Though sports betting has become legal in more states in recent years, the NBA does not allow its players to bet on league games. The NBA began investigating Porter after it identified a number of irregular bets involving him, including increased betting interest on props involving him in a January game in which he played for just four minutes before leaving due to injury. After a March 20 game in which Porter also played only a couple of minutes and left early, his props were the biggest money winner for NBA player props on DraftKings. What To Watch For What happens to Porter’s alleged co-conspirators. Four other people have been charged related to the scheme and have been arraigned but not entered pleas, according to the AP.

                    "text": "Jontay Porter, who was given a lifetime ban from the NBA due to gambling, has pleaded guilty for his role in the scheme that led to his punishment. Porter pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and faces over four years in jail. In court Wednesday, Porter said he agreed to withdraw early from games to get out from under large gambling debts so he and co-conspirators could win bets on his performance. \"I know what I did was wrong, unlawful, and I am deeply sorry,\" he said. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Court papers showed the case against Porter is related to an ongoing prosecution of four other men. The four have been arraigned on a charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud but haven’t yet entered any pleas. Porter received a lifetime ban on April 17 after the NBA found in an investigation that he had disclosed confidential information to sports bettors and bet on games in violation of league rules. The NBA prohibits players from betting on the league or any of its properties. The league said an investigation discovered before \"the [Toronto] Raptors’ March 20 game, [Jontay] disclosed confidential information about his own health status to an individual he knew to be an NBA bettor.\" \"Another individual with whom Porter associated and known to be an NBA bettor subsequently placed an $80,000 parlay proposition bet with an online sports book, to win $1.1 million, wagering [Porter] would underperform in the March 20 game.\" KAWHI LEONARD WITHDRAWS FROM USA BASKETBALL OLYMPIC TEAM He only played three minutes in the March 20 game, claiming to have been sick. The $80,000 prop bet was frozen and not paid out. The NBA said it found that, from January to March of this year, while Jontay was either with the Raptors or its G League team, Raptors 905, he placed \"at least 13 bets on NBA games using an associate’s betting account.\" Porter's lawyer, Jeff Jensen, said last month that Porter had been \"in over his head due to a gambling addiction\" but was getting treatment and cooperating with law enforcement. Porter also gambled on NBA games in which he didn't play, once betting against his own team, the league said. According to the complaint, one of the four men pressed the player to clear up gambling debts by prematurely pulling out of games so that bets on him underperforming would pay off. Since the scandal, the NBA has reportedly held meetings regarding how to combat another, including nixing \"under\" proposition bets from sportsbooks. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sentencing is Dec. 18. He’s also likely to be assessed hundreds of thousands of dollars in restitution, plus potential fines. One of Porter's brothers, Coban, began serving a six-year sentence in April for a fatal DUI crash. Another brother, Michael, is a mainstay with the Denver Nuggets.

                    "text": "Former NBA player Jontay Porter, who was banned from the league for life after he gambled on games he participated in as a member of the Toronto Raptors, has pleaded guilty to a charge of wire fraud conspiracy in connection to the scandal. Porter, who was charged along with four co-conspirators earlier this month by prosecutors in Brooklyn, entered the guilty plea at a court hearing Wednesday. The disgraced player, the brother of Denver Nuggets star Michael Porter Jr., faced a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison if found guilty at trial. However, The Associated Press reports that a punishment between three-and-a-half years to just over four years is expected when sentencing takes place on Dec. 18, 2024. As part of his plea agreement, Porter will not appeal any sentence under five years, ABC News reports. “I knew what I did was wrong and unlawful and I’m deeply sorry for my conduct,” Porter told the judge. His lawyer added that Porter became addicted to gambling and amassed large debts prior to the scheme to derail his own performance in games to benefit his co-conspirators. In April, following a league investigation spurred by a legal sports betting operator, the NBA accused Porter of violating the league’s rules against gambling, claiming he’d given info to sports bettors and taken himself out of games to help his co-conspirators secure “unders” on prop bets based on his performance. In a March 20 game between the Raptors and the Sacramento Kings, Porter played only three minutes of a game before “claiming that he felt ill,” the statement said. Porter also bet on NBA games himself, according to the league’s statement, including betting on his own team the Raptors to lose. “Three of the bets were multi-game parlay bets that included one Raptors game, in which Porter bet that the Raptors would lose. All three bets lost,” the league found. In total, Porter allegedly bet a total of $54,094 and received a payout of $76,059, with net winnings of $21,965. Porter’s NBA salary was about $410,000. “There is nothing more important than protecting the integrity of NBA competition for our fans, our teams and everyone associated with our sport, which is why Jontay Porter’s blatant violations of our gaming rules are being met with the most severe punishment,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in April when the league banned Porter for life. “While legal sports betting creates transparency that helps identify suspicious or abnormal activity, this matter also raises important issues about the sufficiency of the regulatory framework currently in place, including the types of bets offered on our games and players,” Silver continued. “Working closely with all relevant stakeholders across the industry, we will continue to work diligently to safeguard our league and game.”",

                    "text": "NEW YORK -- Former NBA player Jontay Porter admitted Wednesday that he schemed to take himself out of games for gambling's sake, pleading guilty to a federal conspiracy crime in the scandal that already got him banned from the league. \"I know what I did was wrong, unlawful, and I am deeply sorry,\" the former Toronto Raptors center said as he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Echoing findings in an NBA investigation and allegations in an ongoing prosecution of four other men, Porter acknowledged that he agreed to withdraw early from games so that co-conspirators could win bets on his performance. He did it, he said, \"to get out from under large gambling debts.\" Porter, 24, is free on $250,000 bond while awaiting sentencing set for Dec. 18. Prosecutors estimated his sentence at a range from just under 3½ years in prison to a little over four years. Ultimately it will be up to a judge, who could impose anything from no time to 20 years behind bars. Porter also is likely to be assessed hundreds of thousands of dollars in restitution and fines. He and his lawyer left court without speaking to reporters. The attorney, Jeff Jensen, later declined by email to comment beyond a statement he made last month, in which he said Porter \"was in over his head due to a gambling addiction.\" \"Jontay is a good young man with strong faith that will get him through this,\" Jensen said at the time. Porter told the court he has undergone inpatient rehab for a gambling problem and remains in therapy. In a related case, four other men are charged with scheming to profit off tips from an NBA player that he was going to exit two games early. They or their relatives used the knowledge to place big-winning bets that the athlete would do poorly in those games, according to a court complaint filed when they were charged in June. They haven't yet entered pleas. The complaint against them didn't name the player. But details matched up with the NBA investigation that found that Porter gave bettors confidential information about his health, exited at least one game because of bets and wagered on NBA games in which he didn't play. He once bet against his own team, the league said. According to the complaint, one of the four men pressed the player to clear up gambling debts by prematurely pulling out of games so that bets on him underperforming would pay off. In a message responding to the man's instructions, the player wrote that if he didn't carry out the plan, \"u hate me and if I don't get u 8k by Friday you're coming to Toronto to beat me up.\" After tipping off some of the men, the player claimed injury or illness and withdrew from Jan. 26 and March 20 games after only minutes on the court, the complaint said. Porter played only briefly on those dates before complaining he was hurt or sick and exiting the games. His points, rebounds and assists in both games fell below sportsbooks' expectations. According to the complaint, some of the alleged conspirators agreed in advance to share about a quarter of any winnings from the March 20 game with the player. One gambler was on track to collect over $1 million before a betting company got suspicious and stopped him from getting most of the money. After the NBA and others began investigating, the player messaged some of the men that they \"might just get hit w a rico,\" an apparent reference to the common acronym for a federal racketeering charge, according to the complaint against them. It said the player also asked the men whether they had deleted \"all the stuff\" from their phones. Porter averaged 4.4 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 26 games this season, including five starts. He also played in 11 games for the Memphis Grizzlies in the 2020-21 season. His NBA salary was about $410,000.",

                    "text": "After months of teasing her sixth studio album, Katy Perry has finally announced that her next project, titled 143, is on its way this fall. On social media Wednesday (July 10), the 39-year-old pop star unveiled the LP’s cover art — a spacey photo of a nearly nude Perry seemingly levitating in the center of a blue and red cosmos. She also confirmed in the caption that the project will arrive Sept. 20, a full four years after her last album, Smile, arrived in 2020. For those curious about the record’s wordless title, “143” is code for “I love you.” The usage dates back to the early 1900s, per Dictionary.com. “I set out to create a bold, exuberant, celebratory dance-pop album with the symbolic 143 numerical expression of love as a throughline message,” Perry confirmed in a statement. 143 will be led by the recently retired American Idol judge’s previously announced single, “Woman’s World,” which arrives July 11 and was produced by Dr. Luke, Vaughn Oliver, Aaron Joseph and Rocco Did It Again!. One day prior to the album news, she shared a teaser for the track’s music video, featuring high-energy vocals and sultry shots of Perry playing a modernized Rosie the Riveter in a red, white and blue string bikini. According to a release, the track will match much of the songs on 143 — a “sexy, fearless return to form for the multifaceted musician.” Fans can also expect “empowering and provocative pop anthems” with “a lot of heart – and a lot of BPM.” See Perry’s 143 announcement below.",

The album marks Perry’s first studio album since her 2020 LP Smile. “I set out to create a bold, exuberant, celebratory dance-pop album with the symbolic 143 numerical expression of love as a throughline message,” Perry said of the album in a statement. Capitol Records added in a statement that the album is “jam-packed with the kind of empowering and provocative pop anthems fans have come to love, 143 is an album with a lot of heart – and a lot of BPM.” 143 is available to preorder now at Perry’s website in a variety of formats, including exclusive colored vinyl, a cassette version, and more. On Thursday, Perry will share both the song and video for “Woman’s World,” where she cosplays as a risqué Rosie the Riveter. As Rolling Stone previously reported, 143 reconnects Perry with some producers she’s employed in the past — like Stargate (“Firework”), Max Martin and Dr. Luke (the production duo behind “I Kissed a Girl,” “Teenage Dream,” “California Gurls,” and “E.T.”) — as well as some new collaborators. “Katy knew exactly the album she wanted to make and put together the team to make it happen,” a Capitol Records source told Rolling Stone. “And that includes previous collaborators including Luke, Stargate, Max Martin, and Sarah Hudson, and some new heavy hitters such as Vaughn Oliver, Rocco Valdes, and Theron Thomas.”",

[+] Residency at Resorts World Las Vegas on December 29, 2021 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by John Shearer/Getty Images for Katy Perry) Getty Images for Katy Perry Ahead of the release of her first single in years, Katy Perry has made a major announcement. The pop singer has revealed the name and release date of her forthcoming new album, which fans have been waiting patiently for. Perry’s new album is called 143. The project is set to be released on September 20. The news was shared via the singer’s record label, Capitol Records. The announcement refers to the full-length as “a sexy, fearless return to form for the multifaceted musician. Jam-packed with the kind of empowering and provocative pop anthems fans have come to love.” The first single from 143, “Woman’s World,” is set to drop tomorrow (July 11). Perry has been promoting the tune for weeks, and it’s become one of the most-hyped tracks so far this year. “Woman’s World” brings her back to the high-octane dance-pop that has served her well in the past. Through a number of snippets that have been shared via Perry’s social media–as well as at least one brand partnership–millions already have a sense of what the cut will sound like, as well as what to expect from the music video. The upcoming single was co-written by Perry, along with Chloe Angelides and producers Dr. Luke, Vaughn Oliver, Aaron Joseph, and Rocco Did It Again! Luke’s presence brings a certain amount of controversy to the project, as many in the music industry turned on him after Kesha accused him of sexual assault, among other crimes. The two sued each other for years and eventually dropped their suits.

The set peaked at No. 5, making it the lowest-charting full-length from the Grammy nominee since her debut, One of the Boys, in 2008. Smile produced several singles, but none of them hit the highs that Perry had become used to reaching. The biggest hit from the title was “Never Really Over,” which rose as high as No. 15 on the Hot 100. “Daisies” reached No. 40, while several other cuts failed to chart.

                    "text": "It’s a very, very exciting year for all pop girlies because Katy Perry is officially back! On Wednesday, July 10, the 39-year-old singer launched into her newest musical era by announcing her much-anticipated sixth studio album, 143. She shared the news wide on social media, confirming her album’s title — a nod to the throwback pager translation for “I love you” — and sharing its cover artwork and release date: Sept. 20. “I set out to create a bold, exuberant, celebratory dance-pop album with the symbolic 143 numerical expression of love as a throughline message,” Perry explained in a statement. The same day her album arrives, Perry will also headline a sold-out show at Rock in Rio in Brazil, marking her first performance at the Rio de Janeiro festival since 2015. According to a press release shared with PEOPLE, the singer’s forthcoming album marks a “sexy, fearless return to form” for the 13-time Grammy-nominated artist after months of teasing her new pop chapter. The pop star last released her fifth studio album, Smile, back in 2020 but has apparently been eager to drop new music again. During her PLAY Las Vegas Residency in August 2023, Perry joked about fans embracing her “KP6 era,” referring to her soon-to-be-released sixth album. “If you couldn’t love me in my Witness and Smile eras, then you can’t love me in my KP6 era,” the “Teenage Dream” singer told the audience in fan-captured footage. Perry will kick things off officially on Thursday, July 11 with her new album’s first single, “Woman’s World,” described as a “powerful celebration of womanhood in all its forms.” Since first announcing the track on June 17, she’s dropped plenty of breadcrumbs about it and teased a slew of snippets in Instagram posts. On July 4, the “Firework” singer shamelessly promoted her single on Instagram while paying tribute to her 2010 smash hit with a patriotic photo of herself wearing a bedazzled, star-shaped swimsuit emblazoned with stars and stripes. “BB UR A FIREWORK ?and speaking of work, WOMAN’S WORLD IS GOING TO WORK IN ONE WEEK HAPPY 4TH ??,” she wrote in a caption. Ahead of its official release on streaming platforms, “Woman’s World” will also get the music video treatment with a visual dropping on July 12, according to Perry. Perry’s return to music follows her recent exit from American Idol’s judging panel after seven seasons. The musician announced her departure on Jimmy Kimmel Live! back in February, saying, “I think this probably will be my last show, my last season for Idol.” It was then that she also teased her upcoming album, telling host Kimmel, “It’s going to be a very, very exciting year … for all popstar girlies!”",

                    "text": "Katy Perry has officially opened the portal to her new musical era.Perry announced on Tuesday that her new album, \"143,\" will be released on September 20.\"I set out to create a bold, exuberant, celebratory dance-pop album with the symbolic 143 numerical expression of love as a throughline message,\" Perry said in a press release distributed by her label, Capitol Records.143THE ALBUMSEPTEMBER 20THPRE-ORDER NOWhttps://t.co/5nOz1xojRD pic.twitter.com/0BaPSQ8t5WThe press release also bills \"143\" as a \"sexy, fearless return to form\" for Perry, who hasn't released a full-length project since 2020. That album, \"Smile,\" was met with largely negative reviews and lackluster sales; it debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 and its top-charting single, \"Daisies,\" peaked at No. 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. (Her previous three albums, \"Teenage Dream,\" \"Prism,\" and \"Witness,\" all went to No. 1.)Since then, Perry has delivered a small handful of duets and commercial singles, including a cover of \"All You Need Is Love\" for a Gap holiday campaign and the pop song \"Electric\" for a Pokémon soundtrack album.\"143\" will be Perry's sixth major-label release — seventh overall, including her sparsely heard debut \"Katy Hudson,\" a Christian music album released in 2001.The new album's lead single, \"Woman's World,\" is set to arrive on Thursday after more than a month of teasers.The upbeat track will contain themes of freedom and female empowerment, with Perry belting in the chorus, \"Celebrate / We ain't going away / It's a woman's world and you're lucky to be living in it.\"Although teasers for \"Woman's World\" were initially met with disappointment online (and a clip of the music video has received similarly mixed reactions), it does offer a peek into the tone of Perry's hopeful pop comeback.BABY WE AIN’T GOING AWAY!JULY 11TH4PM PT pic.twitter.com/88z73jzWtP\"'143' IS A PARTY AND THE WORLD IS INVITED!\" reads the album description in Perry's online store. \"Get ready for Singalong, Heart Opening, Empowering, Sexy, Provocative Pop Anthems!\"Perry reunited with familiar faces to create \"143,\" a label source told Rolling Stone.Perry previously worked with Dr. Luke, Martin, and Stargate to craft No. 1 hits like \"I Kissed a Girl\" (2008), \"Teenage Dream\" (2010), \"Firework\" (2010), and \"Roar\" (2013).However, Perry has not worked with Dr. Luke since he was sued by Kesha, his former teen protégé, in 2014.Kesha accused Dr. Luke, whose real name is Lukasz Gottwald, of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. He denied all of Kesha's claims and countersued for defamation.\"The abuse I suffered from Luke was a decade long, every day, every moment of every day,\" Kesha said during sworn questioning in 2017.Kesha's battle to escape her contract with Dr. Luke's label, Kemosabe Records, earned her support from fellow pop stars like Adele, Halsey, Lady Gaga, and Taylor Swift, who donated $250,000 to help cover Kesha's legal fees.The parties reached an undisclosed settlement last year. Shortly after, Kesha announced that she had fulfilled her contractual obligation to Kemosabe and released her first song as an independent artist, \"Joyride,\" earlier this month.Given Dr. Luke's embattled reputation among artists and fans alike, Perry's decision to reunite with him sparked backlash. However, the Capitol Records source told Rolling Stone that Perry personally assembled her team for the album.\"Katy knew exactly the album she wanted to make and put together the team to make it happen,\" the source said.Perry also reconnected with Sarah Hudson, who cowrote Perry's diamond-certified hit \"Dark Horse,\" as well as several tracks from her 2017 album \"Witness.\"Newcomers to Perry's orbit include Vaughn Oliver, Rocco Valdes, and Theron Thomas, according to the label source.Oliver is an up-and-coming pop producer who has teamed up with Gottwald multiple times, coproducing hits like Latto's \"Big Energy\" and Nicki Minaj's \"Super Freaky Girl.\"Valdes — better known by his stage name Rocco Did It Again! — is another member of Gottwald's inner circle. The two share production credits on songs by Doja Cat, Kim Petras, Minaj, and more.Thomas is a Grammy-winning songwriter who signed with Kemosabe in 2014. More recently, he has written songs with Beyoncé (\"All Night\"), Lizzo (\"Juice,\" \"Tempo,\" \"About Damn Time\"), and Usher (\"No Limit,\" \"Bad Habits\").This is a developing story.

                    "text": "Movie star and lifelong Democrat George Clooney added his voice to calls for Joe Biden to leave the presidential race on Wednesday, just weeks after headlining a fundraiser that brought in a record single-night haul for the president's reelection campaign. Clooney said in a New York Times opinion piece that he loves Biden, but the party would lose the presidential race as well as any control in Congress with him as the nominee. “This isn’t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I’ve spoken with in private,” wrote Clooney. He's hosted several high-dollar Hollywood fundraisers, including for Biden last month. Clooney argued the party should pick a new nominee at its convention next month, saying the process would be “messy” but “wake up” voters in the party’s favor, mentioning Vice President Kamala Harris and Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gavin Newsom of California among those from who the country should now hear. Focusing much of his piece around Biden's age, Clooney noted differences he saw in the 81-year-old president during their recent Los Angeles event compared to years past. “It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe ‘big F-ing deal’ Biden of 2010,\" Clooney wrote. “He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.” Last month, Clooney, Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand were among those who took the stage for a fundraiser that took in a record $30 million-plus for Biden, in hopes of energizing would-be supporters for a White House contest they said may rank among the most consequential in U.S. history. Luminaries from the entertainment world have increasingly lined up to help Biden’s campaign. Leading up to the fundraiser, Clooney's name appeared on numerous fundraising missives from the campaign, which he called “the fight of our lives.” Representatives for Clooney did not immediately return a message seeking comment on insight into his decision, when precisely he had made it or how recently he had spoken with Biden. Biden has refused to end his reelection bid after his weak debate performance against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump on June 27. ___ Kinnard reported from Chapin, South Carolina.

                    "text": "The astronauts piloting the inaugural crewed flight of Boeing’s new Starliner spacecraft said on July 10 that they are confident the capsule will return them home safely, despite ongoing issues with its propulsion and thruster system. NASA’s two veteran test pilots for Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner, Barry “Butch” Wilmore and Sunita “Suni” Williams, have been aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for nearly five weeks after successfully launching from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on June 5. They hosted a live briefing from the ISS with reporters on July 10 to discuss the future of the mission and efforts to resolve issues with Starliner before scheduling a return flight. Steve Stich, program manager for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, told reporters on July 10 that Boeing and NASA are “optimistically” looking toward a late-July return window but that nothing is certain yet. “We'll just follow the data each step at a time. And then, at the right time, figure out when the right undock opportunity is,” he said. Mr. Wilmore described the June 5 launch as “spectacular” and “truly amazing” and emphasized that he is “absolutely confident” that Boeing’s spacecraft will return him and Ms. Williams safely to Earth. Ms. Williams suggested that Starliner is ready for a return flight now if necessary. “I feel confident that if we had to, if there was a problem with the International Space Station, we can get in our spacecraft, and we can undock, talk to our team, and figure out the best way to come home,” she said. “I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem,” Ms. Williams added. When asked if Boeing’s years of delays to ready the spacecraft for its first crewed mission has affected his confidence in Starliner, Mr. Wilmore said spaceflight is a “world of test” and that “failure is not an option.” He said Hurricane Beryl’s hitting Texas created a “little bit of a hiccup” to NASA crews in Texas this week, but testing is still underway on another Starliner capsule at White Sands Test Facility in Las Cruces, New Mexico. The goal is to replicate what happened to thrusters before they went offline after takeoff and determine the exact cause of the helium leak. The issue, Mr. Stich pointed out, is replicating the same temperatures at White Sands that Starliner experienced during flight. The spacecraft is still ready for a return in the event of an emergency, he added. “If the crew needed to return at any point in time, it’s go for return for any kind of emergency on board [the ISS],” Mr. Stich said. NASA had said before launch that Starliner was limited to docking with the ISS for 45 days due to limitations in its battery cells. Mr. Stich explained that battery capacity shouldn’t limit Starliner’s time at the ISS, as the crew hasn’t seen any “degradation” in the cells. “If you don’t see any signs the battery is degrading, or even cells are degrading, then your risk level for a given day is the same,” he said. That would mean the risk of the batteries failing would be the same on day 45 as it is today, Mr. Stich explained. Even if Starliner was forced to undergo an emergency undocking and reentry, the propulsion and thruster system could handle the flight, said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing’s Commercial Crew Program. “If we were to have to do that today, we would just perform a nominal undocking and return. The propulsion system is highly redundant on each other, so if there was an issue with any one of the thrusters, the redundancy would take over and bring it safely home again,” Mr. Nappi said.",

                    "text": "NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams expressed confidence in their Boeing Starliner's ability to bring them home amid ongoing delays. The two opened up about their hopes for the future of the expedition while answering questions from reporters during an International Space Station press conference streamed live by CBS News on Wednesday, July 10. Williams, 58, said she has \"a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem,\" during the call. \"But like Butch said, we're learning now to optimize our specific situation and make sure that we know everything about it,\" the veteran astronaut continued, noting that if they \"just came home\" now they would lose some of the data they intend to obtain. \"I have confidence. Butch has confidence. We're here on the space station with our safe haven of Starliner,\" she added. Later on in the conference, Williams stated that they are having a \"great time\" in space. \"Butch and I have been up here before, and it feels like coming back home. It feels good to float around. It feels good to be in space and work up here with the International Space Station team. So, yeah, it's great to be up here,\" she said. “I'm not complaining, Butch isn't complaining, that we're here for a couple extra weeks.\" In the latter portion of the conference, Wilmore, 61, echoed his partner's optimism. \"That mantra you’ve heard, failure is not an option. And that’s why we’re staying here now,\" he said. The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now! The astronaut acknowledged the speculation that helium leaks and thruster problems may be the source of the delay, saying, \"We know that and that's why we're staying because we're going to test it. That's what we do. That's what we do in this business. We're going to get the data that we need to help inform our decisions, so we make the right decisions. And that's why we feel confident.\" The spacecraft successfully launched on June 5 at 10:52 a.m. local time from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Florida's Space Coast. The flight marks the sixth inaugural journey of a crewed spacecraft in U.S. history, NASA said in a May press conference. Wilmore and Williams were originally expected to return to Earth on June 14. The trip was extended to June 18, but now officials say the \"earliest they could return may be the end of July,\" per AP News. On July 2, NASA’s commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said the two astronauts \"are not stranded in space\" when concerns were raised about their return, according to ABC News. At the time, Stich said there is currently no targeted date for the astronauts return, per CBS News. \"We're not going to target a specific date until we get that testing completed,” he said, later adding, \"I think we’re on a good path.\" Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Boeing program manager Mark Nappi previously told CBS News that the Starliner has not experienced any new issues as they work to resolve the old ones, and believes \"we can return with Starliner at any time.\" Nappi insisted: \"We're not stuck on ISS.

                    "text": "As a matter of jurisprudence, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has reason to be delighted by the high court’s shift to the far right. Indeed, the controversial jurist has consistently found himself in the majority as he and other Republican-appointed justices have issued a series of reactionary rulings. But while Thomas is likely pleased with the Supreme Court’s ideological direction, he’s probably less satisfied with the difficult ethics questions he’s faced over the last year or so. The Hill just reported, for example, on the latest congressional escalation in the larger discussion. While the letter was dated July 3, the Democratic senators released the correspondence to the public Tuesday. “We do not make this request lightly,” Whitehouse and Wyden wrote. “The evidence assembled thus far plainly suggests that Justice Thomas has committed numerous willful violations of federal ethics and false-statement laws and raises significant questions about whether he and his wealthy benefactors have complied with their federal tax obligations. Presented with opportunities to resolve questions about his conduct, Justice Thomas has maintained a suspicious silence.” The senators concluded, “No government official should be above the law. Supreme Court justices are properly expected to obey laws designed to prevent conflicts of interest and the appearance of impropriety and to comply with the federal tax code. We therefore request that you appoint a Special Counsel authorized to investigate potential criminal violations by Justice Thomas under the disclosure, false statement, and tax laws; pursue leads of related criminal violations by donors, lenders, and intermediate corporate entities; and determine whether any such loans and gifts were provided pursuant to a coordinated enterprise or plan.” Circling back to our earlier coverage, Thomas has faced difficult ethics questions for many years, but his difficulties took a more serious turn last spring. ProPublica published a rather devastating report in early April of last year, shining a light on the generous and undisclosed benefits Thomas has received from a Republican megadonor. In the weeks and months that followed, ProPublica took the lead on exposing Thomas’ other unusual ties to his wealthy friend, but the outlet wasn’t alone. The New York Times also took the story further, shining a light on previously unreported benefits the justice has received from a “cohort of wealthy and powerful friends,” thanks to his connections established through the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans. The Times added fresh reporting last summer on one of Thomas’ other wealthy pals providing the sitting justice with undisclosed financing that made it possible for Thomas to buy an expensive recreational vehicle. How big was the loan? Neither the justice nor his friend say. How much did Thomas repay? They wouldn’t say. What were the terms of the loan? They wouldn’t say. Was there a formal loan agreement? They wouldn’t say. Soon ProPublica published another report that made the entire controversy look considerably worse, noting that Thomas had received “at least 38 destination vacations, including a previously unreported voyage on a yacht around the Bahamas; 26 private jet flights, plus an additional eight by helicopter; a dozen VIP passes to professional and college sporting events, typically perched in the skybox; two stays at luxury resorts in Florida and Jamaica; and one standing invitation to an uber-exclusive golf club overlooking the Atlantic coast.” In each instance, the far-right jurist’s luxurious benefits “have been underwritten by benefactors who share the ideology that drives his jurisprudence.” Though the precise value of the trips is difficult to measure, ProPublica described it as “likely in the millions” of dollars. It’s an impossible dynamic to defend: Thomas has lived the life of a wealthy man, thanks to the generosity of his rich, likeminded friends. As my MSNBC colleague Zeeshan Aleem explained, “There is nothing partisan about calling this what it is: a brazen, shameful abuse of power that undermines the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. That Thomas reportedly took these gifts is alarming enough. That he reportedly took them without disclosing that he had taken them (with rare exceptions) makes it hard to believe that Thomas doesn’t realize how bad this all looks.” Earlier this year it reached the point at which Thomas became a punch-line to jokes about Supreme Court corruption. (In February, The Onion, a satirical outlet, published a memorable item with a headline that read, “Clarence Thomas Announces 50% Discount On All Favorable Rulings.”) Now, at least two senators want the Justice Department to take matters to the next level with the appointment of a special counsel. The attorney general is unlikely to agree, but it’ll be interesting to see how (and whether) Garland responds. Watch this space. This post updates our related earlier coverage.",

Berke, the justice’s attorney, previously said that Thomas “has always strived for full transparency and adherence to the law, including with respect to what personal travel needed to be reported,” adding that any failures of disclosure were “strictly inadvertent.” The two senators specifically called on the DoJ to examine a “$267,000 loan Thomas used to purchase a luxury motor coach in 1999, adding that they have not received adequate answers from Thomas about how he handled the matter,” per the Post. As Breitbart News reported last year, the justice disclosed gifts received after financial disclosure rules were changed. “Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’s financial disclosures this week have fueled hyperventilating attacks from leftwing Democrats, but they actually show their concerted efforts against the only black conservative on the nation’s highest court are groundless,” reported Ken Klukowski. “Financial disclosure guidance for federal judges changed in March, and Thomas accordingly disclosed additional details from hospitality and gifts he had received in past years. His critics – who happen to ardently oppose his views of the Constitution and the law – pounced, arguing that these disclosures suggest wrongdoing,” he added. Conservatives argue that this is reverse court-packing. Some liberal Democrats pushed legislation to increase the number of Supreme Court justices so they could add liberal members. When that failed, they started targeted campaigns to force the most conservative members of the court to recuse themselves from high-profile cases.",

Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said Tuesday they had asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel to investigate Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and benefactors who showered him with free luxury vacations, plane travel, evidently forgiven debts and other gifts. Who said what In a July 3 letter to Garland, Wyden and Whitehouse called for a criminal investigation into the \"strong possibility of multiple federal ethics, tax and false statement violations\" by the conservative justice. \"We do not make this request lightly,\" they wrote. \"The evidence assembled thus far plainly suggests that Justice Thomas has committed numerous willful violations\" of federal laws. Two days before the senators sent their letter, CNBC said, Thomas, in a \"pivotal court ruling, questioned whether the DOJ has the power to even appoint a special counsel.\" What next? The Justice Department has the legal authority to appoint a special counsel to investigate Thomas, but \"inevitably it would be seen as political retribution for rulings the justices made that they don't like,\" Jeremy Fogel, the director of the Berkeley Judicial Institute, said to The Washington Post. \"I just don't know how you get out of that box.\" Subscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

                    "text": "A pair of Senate Democrats has asked the Justice Department to criminally investigate Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas over travel given as gifts and a loan for a luxury car from wealthy donor friends. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who chairs the Judiciary subcommittee on federal courts, and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden of Oregon sent a letter last week asking Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel to examine whether Thomas violated federal ethics and tax laws when he didn't disclose as income more than $267,000 of a loan that was allegedly forgiven in 2008. \"We do not make this request lightly,\" the senators wrote. \"The evidence assembled thus far plainly suggests that Justice Thomas has committed numerous willful violations of federal ethics and false-statement laws and raises significant questions about whether he and his wealthy benefactors have complied with their federal tax obligations.\" A spokesperson for the Supreme Court didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night. Justice Department spokesperson Joshua Stueve declined to comment Wednesday morning. The Senate Finance Committee said last year it reviewed documents from Thomas' friend Anthony Welters and concluded that Thomas didn't pay back principal or interest on a loan Welters provided to Thomas and his wife in 1999 for a luxury motor coach. The senators said at the time that Thomas had made interest payments only on the loan before he stopped payments. Elliot S. Berke, an attorney for Thomas, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night. He contended in a letter to the Finance Committee this year that Thomas “made payments to Mr. Welters on a regular basis until the terms of the agreement were satisfied in full.” In their letter to Garland, the two senators also referred to free travel aboard a private yacht and a jet, among other gifts, from billionaire Harlan Crow and other wealthy benefactors that they say were largely omitted from Thomas’ financial disclosure forms. The gifts were first reported by ProPublica last year. In a statement last month, Berke said that the Judicial Conference had changed a provision allowing for a personal hospitality exemption and that Thomas \"has fully complied with the new disclosure requirement.” Thomas last month acknowledged a pair of trips in 2019 with Crow in his annual financial disclosure report. The same month, the Senate Judiciary Committee released records showing Crow provided Thomas with additional undisclosed trips. This story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

                    "text": "A manhunt is under way after three woman were killed in a crossbow attack at their home in Bushey, on the outskirts of London on Tuesday night. Carol Hunt, 61, and her two daughters, aged 25 and 28, were killed at their home in Hertfordshire. The BBC has confirmed Ms. Hunt was married to horse racing commentator John Hunt. Hertfordshire Police, assisted by other forces, has launched a manhunt for the 26-year-old suspect, Kyle Clifford, who is believed to still be in possession of the crossbow. Police say he is believed to be in Hertfordshire or north London. Armed police searched a house in Enfield, north London on Wednesday morning but there was no trace of the suspect. Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson from Hertfordshire Police told a press conference the victims had been “targeted” and there was no reason to believe the suspect posed a threat to the general public. He said, “Our overarching objective today is to protect public safety and to locate Kyle Clifford, who is wanted in connection with the murder of the three women in what we believe is a targeted incident.” “The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used,” he added. The danger from crossbows has been highlighted several times over the years. In November 2018 Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo, 51, used one of the weapons to kill his pregnant ex-wife, Devi, 35, at her home in Ilford, east London. Her unborn baby miraculously survived. The then-Prime Minister Theresa May said her government would “consider the risk to public safety and whether further measures are needed.” When would-be assassin Jaswant Singh Chail, armed with a loaded crossbow, was arrested in the grounds of Windsor Castle on Christmas Day 2021 the then-Home Secretary Priti Patel promised to review the law surrounding crossbows. Last year Chail was jailed for nine years after admitting an offence under the Treason Act. Bryce Hodgson, 30, had pleaded guilty to a stalking offence at Croydon Crown Court in July 2023 and was given a suspended prison sentence of 16 weeks. Then in February this year the government finally unveiled plans to outlaw the sale of crossbows except under strict conditions. Buyers would be subject to strict police checks, as are already in place for firearms. The Home Office completed the work in April but no legislation was introduced before the general election campaign began. Several figures from the horse racing world have posted condolences on social media platform X. ITV racing commentator Matt Chapman wrote: “No words needed for what has happened to [Mr. Hunt] and family today. “Impossible to comprehend the pain. Just know we are all here for you John. We love you pal – racing loves you,” he added. The Amateur Jockeys Association of Great Britain also sent their sympathies on X.",

                    "text": "Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck’s eldest child revealed that she contracted a post-viral condition in 2019 as she demanded mask mandates in LA hospitals during a city board meeting on Tuesday. Violet Affleck, 18, shared her experience with recovering from viruses in an emotional plea in front of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, saying “the county must oppose mask bans for any reason.” During public comments, a section where residents have a chance to ask questions and advocate for a cause, Violet introduced herself before urging the board for the mandate. “Hi, Violet Affleck, Los Angeles resident, first-time voter, I’m 18,” she said in a clip of the meeting shared on X. “I contracted a post-viral condition in 2019,” she continued while donning a face mask. “I’m OK now, but I saw first-hand that medicine does not always have answers to the consequences of even minor viruses.” “The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown that into sharper relief,” she added. According to the Mayo Clinic, a post-viral condition — also known as “long Covid” — occurs following a viral infection. Symptoms can last for months and often include fatigue, lethargy, memory loss, inability to focus, and exhaustion. “One in 10 infections leads to long COVID, which is a devastating neurological and cardiovascular illness that can take away people’s ability to work, see, move and even think,” Violet said during the meeting. “‘It stands to exacerbate our homelessness crisis, as well as the suffering of many people in our city. It hits communities of color, disabled people, elderly people, trans people, women and anyone in a public-facing essential job the hardest.” In February, Los Angeles public health officials announced that employees and visitors to city healthcare facilities would no longer be required to wear masks. More than 37,000 people in Los Angeles died of COVID throughout the pandemic, trailing coronary heart disease and Alzheimer’s deaths, according to officials. “To confront the long COVID crisis, I demand mask availability, air filtration and far-UVC lights in government facilities, including jails and detention centers, and mask mandates in county medical facilities,” the teen added. “We must expand the availability of free tests and treatment and, most importantly, the county must oppose mask bans for any reason.” “They do not keep us safer, they make vulnerable members of our community less safe and make everyone less able to participate in Los Angeles together. Thank you.” Violet also wore a mask during Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin’s Hamptons party last year, where she was snapped with her dad and stepmom Jennifer Lopez. The teen often opts to wear a face mask while out and about running errands. Affleck and Garner divorced in 2015 after 10 years of marriage and are also parents to Seraphina, 15, and Samuel, 12.

                    "text": "Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner’s daughter Violet Affleck is making her voice heard. The 18-year-old spoke out against mask bans in a passionate speech at a Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday. While advocating for mask availability, high-quality free COVID-19 testing and “mask mandates in county medical facilities,” Violet revealed she “contracted a post-viral condition in 2019.” The high school graduate noted, “I’m OK now, but I saw first-hand that medicine does not always have answers to the consequences of even minor viruses. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown that into sharper relief. “One in 10 infections leads to long COVID, which is a devastating neurological [and] cardiovascular illness that can take away people’s ability to work, move, see, and even think,” she continued, before concluding with a call to “oppose mask bans for any reason.” Affleck and Garner’s eldest child explained, “They do not keep us safer, they make vulnerable members of our community less safe and make everyone less able to participate in Los Angeles together.” Violet, who is often photographed wearing a face covering while out and about with her parents, sported a face mask and a floral dress during her speech at the Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration. While some social media users blasted the teen’s testimony, others called her an “amazing leader and role model.” One wrote, “I’m showing this to my 7 & 9 year old girls as a great example of a smart, thoughtful and self assured young woman 1) doing what she knows is right, even in the face of massive societal pressure to cave 2) using her voice & privilege for the greater good.” Another pointed out that it was “extremely impressive how much she fit into … one minute.” Garner, 52, has publicly praised Violet as being “totally in charge” of her future, telling Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos in November 2023 that she acted “like a champ” as her high school graduation approached. “She’s a self-starter,” the actress tearfully gushed to “Live with Kelly and Mark” viewers. “And I”m proud of her no matter what.” The “13 Going on 30” star was a “wreck” for a “whole month” ahead of the teenager’s commencement ceremony in May. She posted Instagram photos of herself crying, writing, “Tell me you have a graduate without telling me you have a graduate. (bless our hearts).” The “Alias” alum and Ben, who are also the parents of Seraphina, 15, and Samuel, 12, celebrated with a June graduation party. Even Jennifer Lopez attended the bash — albeit, briefly — despite her and Ben’s looming divorce. While Violet’s college plans have not been confirmed, she hinted that she’ll be a future Yale University student when she posed in a telling sweatshirt for a recent photo. Before heading to the Connecticut school, Violet has been spending the summer stepping out with Lopez and her parents.",

                    "text": "Violet Affleck may be a relatively new member of the Los Angeles voting community, but she is already putting her voice to use.The 18-year-old daughter of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner gave an impassioned speech at a regularly scheduled meeting of the LA County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, July 9. In the rare public appearance, Violet spoke about the importance of mask availability, among other methods of maintaining public safety amid COVID-19.She stepped up to the microphone once residents were allowed to make public comments. There, Violet revealed that she herself had dealt with the ramifications of a post-viral condition in 2019, after contracting COVID-19. \"I'm OK now, but I saw firsthand that medicine does not always have answers to the consequences of even minor viruses. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown that into sharper relief,\" she said.\"One in 10 infections leads to long COVID, which is a devastating neurological and cardiovascular illness that can take away people's ability to work, see, move and even think,\" Violet continued. She also explained that vulnerable communities across the United States are the ones who are being hit hardest by this. \"To confront the long COVID crisis, I demand mask availability, air filtration and far-UVC lights in government facilities, including jails and detention centers, and mask mandates in county medical facilities,\" Violet said at the meeting.The teenager had to speak quickly to contain her speech to the allotted time frame for the public. She called for the expansion of the availability of free tests, as well as treatment, but came out most fervently against mask bans. \"They do not keep us safer, they make vulnerable members of our community less safe and make everyone less able to participate in Los Angeles together. Thank you,\" she concluded.Post-viral conditions occur after contracting a virus, such as COVID-19, and can lead to respiratory, neurological, psychological, and cardiac problems, such as fatigue, brain fog, headaches, dizziness upon standing, loss of smell, and more, per Yale Medicine.Long COVID is categorized as new, persistent, or recurring symptoms that occur at least four or more weeks after the initial infection with COVID-19. Stars like Gwyneth Paltrow, Dave Navarro, and Alyssa Milano have also spoken about the \"pretty wild\" symptoms they had to deal with due to long COVID.Violet is the oldest daughter of exes Affleck and Garner, who also share Finn, 15, and Samuel, 12. The couple, who tied the knot in June 2005, divorced in 2018.",

                    "text": "Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner's 18-year-old daughter Violet is urging Los Angeles officials to oppose mask bans and to issue a mask mandate in medical facilities to help reduce the risk of long COVID, a condition that persists in some patients after being infected with the virus. After she introduced herself during an L.A. County Board of Supervisors meeting on Tuesday as a Los Angeles resident and first-time voter, Violet Affleck explained that she developed a post-viral condition in 2019. In a clip shared on social media, she said that while she is OK now, it showed her that \"medicine does not always have answers to the consequences of even minor viruses. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown that into sharper relief.\"\"One in 10 infections leads to long COVID, which is a devastation neurological, cardiovascular illness that can take away people's ability to work, move, see and even think\" she said.To help reduce the risk, she called for mask availability and other COVID prevention measures like air filtration and the use of far UV-C light, which can kill viruses, in government facilities, including jails. She also urged mask mandates in county medical facilities. \"We must expand availability of high quality, free tests and treatment,\" she said. \"And most importantly, the county must oppose mask bans for any reason. They do not keep us safer. They make more vulnerable members of our community less safe and make everyone less able to participate in Los Angeles together.\"Affleck said COVID still \"hits communities of color, disabled people, elderly people, trans people, women and anyone in a public-facing essential jobs the hardest.\"Her comments come at a time when COVID cases are once again on the rise in the U.S., particularly in western states.Since the beginning of the pandemic, millions of Americans have experienced long COVID, also known as post-COVID syndrome or condition, which may include a continuation of symptoms similar to the original infection, like fatigue and shortness of breath, according to the Mayo Clinic, Symptoms can also include memory loss, generalized pain and orthostasis, decreased blood pressure when standing up or sitting down, and an array of other problems.Mask mandates to prevent the spread of COVID were issued in cities across the U.S. at the height of the pandemic in 2020, but as cases went down, most places stopped requiring masks. Recently, some cities have weighed proposals to ban masks — a development that concerns those who rely on masks to help prevent illness. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul backed the idea of a mask ban in New York City's subway system aimed at criminals covering their faces — but with exceptions for people wearing masks for their health. A similar mask ban was proposed by a local alderman in Chicago earlier this month, and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass weighed a mask ban for protesters to make it easier to identify those who allegedly commit crimes, according to the Los Angeles Times. California's Division of Public Health rescinded its mask requirement for medical professionals in February when COVID cases receded. The state, however, said it could reverse course if the threat of COVID increases. The department recommends those infected with COVID or who could have been exposed should still wear a mask, as well as people who are vulnerable to getting sick, like the elderly or those with medical conditions. So-called strategic masking, or \"wearing a mask where and when it might matter most,\" can be an option for decreasing your risk of COVID, according to a 2023 report from Yale Medicine. The report recommends considering your personal risk, such as if you have a medical condition, live in a care facility, are elderly or pregnant, or if you are in a medical facility or a crowded place, when choosing whether or not to wear a mask.",

                    "text": "LONDON (AP) — British police launched a huge manhunt Wednesday for a man believed to be armed with a crossbow and potentially other weapons after three women were killed in a house northwest of London. The BBC said the women killed were the family of well-known radio racing commentator John Hunt. Hertfordshire Police said Kyle Clifford, 26, was being sought over the suspected triple murder, which involved a crossbow and potentially other unnamed weapons. The public were urged not to approach Clifford if they see him. Armed police officers and specialist search teams were “responding at pace in the wake of what has been an horrific incident,” Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said. Police said the three women — ages 25, 28 and 61 — were found seriously injured in a house in Bushey, northwest of London, on Tuesday evening. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene. BBC Radio 5 Live, the corporation’s main news and sports radio channel, said the victims were Carol Hunt, wife of its commentator John Hunt, and two of their daughters. John Hunt is BBC radio’s main horse racing commentator, his voice known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby. The Daily Mail newspaper and others reported that he found the bodies early Tuesday evening after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse south of London. As part of a note sent to BBC staff, the broadcaster described the incident as “utterly devastating” and that it will provide Hunt “with all the support we can.” Police did not say whether Clifford, who is from London, was connected to the women, but British media reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters. The BBC reported that Clifford left the British Army after a brief period of service in 2022. Local councillor Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area is “a typical leafy British suburb.” “At about eight o’clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,” he told the BBC. Addressing the suspect directly, Simpson said: “Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.” Britain’s new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she is being kept “fully informed” about the “truly shocking” incident. People in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse. A spokesperson for the Home Office said Cooper will “swiftly consider” the findings from a recently launched review into whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced. — By PAN PYLAS Associated Press",

The victims were the wife and daughters of John Hunt, a BBC commentator on the network’s horse racing channel. Carol Hunt, 61, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25, were all shot with a crossbow. Despite the efforts of paramedics, all three women died at the scene. Authorities determined that the attack was “targeted” and that the suspect, allegedly one of the victims’ ex-boyfriends, was known to the women. Throughout Wednesday, an extensive manhunt involving helicopters had been conducted in search of Clifford. His home in Enfield had been searched, but authorities had apprehended him at a cemetery nearby. He has been apprehended by police “with no shots fired” and is receiving medical treatment for his injuries. Justine Jenkins, detective inspector from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, is asking for the public to be respectful of the family’s privacy during this “incredibly difficult time for the victims’ family.” In the United Kingdom, crossbows are legal and do not require a permit to purchase or use.",

                    "text": "Former Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Josh Klinghoffer was hit with a wrongful death lawsuit Wednesday, accusing him of negligence behind the wheel that led to the death of 47-year-old California grandfather Israel Sanchez. According to the suit — filed at the Superior Court of the State of California on behalf of Sanchez’s daughter, Ashley — the incident occurred in March of 2024, not long before Klinghoffer went on tour as a session musician for Pearl Jam. The suit alleges that the guitarist, driving an SUV with no plates, was distracted by his phone and hit Sanchez, who was on his way to the grocery store to make a meal for his family. Sanchez died later that day due to blunt force trauma from his injuries. The suit also alleges that Klinghoffer was not arrested after the incident and that he never reached out to the family. It includes up to 20 Does, identified as agents, servants, employees, and other folks associated with the musician. “My dad was known for being a great chef, the most talented of his family, the greatest grandpa always full of love and joy,” Ashley Sanchez said in a release. “His smile was so infectious. His life was taken by a careless act of a person who didn’t bother to look where he was driving.” “Mr. Klinghoffer should be arrested and prosecuted for homicide. We have a video of him on his cell phone at the time he hit and killed Israel Sanchez, a loving father, in a crosswalk,” added the family’s attorney, Nick Rowley. The family is suing Klinghoffer for pain and suffering, medical costs, attorney fees, and more. They’re currently asking for a jury trial. “This was a tragic accident,” Klinghoffer’s attorney tells Rolling Stone. “After which, Josh immediately pulled over, stopped the vehicle, called 911, and waited until police and the ambulance arrived. He is fully cooperating with the traffic investigation.” Klinghoffer was fired by his Chili Pepper bandmates in 2019 when their long-time guitarist, John Frusciante, elected to rejoin the group. He went solo soon after under the name Pluralone, opening for Pearl Jam before joining the band in 2021. He’s credited on their latest album, Dark Matter.",

                    "text": "Josh Klinghoffer, the former guitarist of Red Hot Chili Peppers, was sued for wrongful death and negligence after allegedly running over and killing a pedestrian in Alhambra, California, reports Variety and TMZ. The lawsuit was filed by the family of Israel Sanchez, the 47-year-old man who was struck by the musician’s car in the March 18 incident. According to the lawsuit, Klinghoffer was allegedly on his phone while driving an SUV and made a left turn while Sanchez was walking across the street in a marked crosswalk. The impact caused blunt-force trauma to the head, and Sanchez died from his injuries hours later. The complaint also states that an arrest was never made in the incident. “This was a tragic accident,” said Klinghoffer’s attorney, Andrew B. Brettler, in a statement shared with Pitchfork. “After the car struck the pedestrian, Josh immediately pulled over, stopped the vehicle, called 911, and waited until police and the ambulance arrived. He is fully cooperating with the traffic investigation.” “Mr. Klinghoffer should be arrested and prosecuted for homicide. We have a video of him on his cell phone at the time he hit and killed Israel Sanchez, a loving father, in a crosswalk,” the Sanchez family’s attorney, Nick Rowley, told Variety. “Israel Sanchez was on his way to the grocery store to make soup for his family and never came home. He did everything right, looking for oncoming traffic and abiding by pedestrian signage, but tragically Mr. Klinghoffer, in a rush and on his phone, hit him fatally from behind with a large SUV. The loss and grief that the Sanchez family now faces is immense. We will not stop until there is accountability and justice for Mr. Sanchez and his family.” Klinghoffer played guitar with the Red Hot Chili Peppers from 2009 to 2019, when he was replaced by longtime member John Frusciante. Klinghoffer was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the band in 2012, making him the youngest inductee ever at the time. Since leaving the band, he has been performing as a touring member of Pearl Jam and Jane’s Addiction.",

                    "text": "The daughter of man who was fatally struck by a vehicle in Alhambra in March filed a wrongful death lawsuit on Wednesday, July 10, against the driver, a guitarist who has played with Pearl Jam and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Josh Klinghoffer was named in the lawsuit filed by Ashley Sanchez, the daughter of 47-year-old Israel Sanchez, alleging that he was distracted when his SUV collided with her father, according to the court papers. On March 18, Israel Sanchez was on his way to the store get groceries to make soup for his family, walking in a protected crosswalk at Main Street and Meridian Avenue, when he was struck by the SUV, falling to the ground and being dragged a few feet until the vehicle came to a stop, according to video footage provided by Sanchez’s attorney. Sanchez died hours later in a hospital. “My dad was known for being a great chef, the most talented of his family, the greatest grandpa always full of love and joy,” Ashley Sanchez said in a statement. “His smile was so infectious. His life was taken by a careless act of a person who didn’t bother to look where he was driving.” Klinghoffer, who remained at the scene and was not detained, did not have a license plate on his SUV at the time of the crash, according to the suit. The Alhambra Police Department did not immediately respond to request for comment. “(Sanchez) did everything right, looking for oncoming traffic and abiding by pedestrian signage, but tragically Mr. Klinghoffer, in a rush and on his phone, hit him fatally from behind with a large SUV,” Nick Rowley, the daughter’s attorney, said on Wednesday. “The loss and grief that the Sanchez family now faces is immense.” In a Wednesday statement, Klinghoffer’s attorney, Andrew Brettler, said the crash was a “tragic accident.” “After which, Josh immediately pulled over, stopped the vehicle, called 911, and waited until police and the ambulance arrived. He is fully cooperating with the traffic investigation.” Ashley Sanchez seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages",

                    "text": "Josh Klinghoffer, a former guitarist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, is facing a wrongful death lawsuit over allegations that he struck and killed a pedestrian near Los Angeles earlier this year due to “distracted driving.” Filed in Los Angeles court Wednesday (July 10), the case claims that Klinghoffer was driving a black 2022 GMC Yukon with no license plates on March 18 in Alhambra, Calif., when he took a left turn and struck 47-year-old Israel Sanchez in a crosswalk. Sanchez later died of his injuries. “Video of the incident shows that defendant Josh Adam Klinghoffer made no braking or slowing motion until after he fatally struck Israel Sanchez, indicating that defendant was likely driving while distracted,” lawyers for the victim’s daughter, Ashley, write in the complaint, obtained by Billboard. “This horrible outcome was foreseeable and demonstrates a willful disregard for the rights and safety of others.” Sanchez’s lawyers claim they have video evidence that shows that Klinghoffer was “using a device mere seconds before he crashed” into Sanchez. The lawsuit claims that Klinghoffer was not arrested after the incident, left for a tour with his band, and has never reached out to Sanchez’s family: “He has shown no remorse for his behavior.” In a statement to Billboard, Klinghoffer’s attorney Andrew Brettler said: “This was a tragic accident. After which, Josh immediately pulled over, stopped the vehicle, called 911, and waited until police and the ambulance arrived. He is fully cooperating with the traffic investigation.” After serving as a touring guitarist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers in the late 2000s, Klinghoffer joined the band as a full-time member in 2010 to replace longtime guitarist John Frusciante. But in 2019, after performing on two studio albums, he was fired by his bandmates after Frusciante chose to return to the group. He later served as a touring musician for Pearl Jam and has released solo material under the pseudonym Pluralone. In technical terms, the lawsuit accuses Klinghoffer of wrongful death and negligence — meaning that he allegedly knew that what he was doing was dangerous but did it anyway. “Klinghoffer … was more focused on his personal business than on acting as a responsible driver,” the lawsuit says. “These decisions culminated in the motor vehicle, inflicting fatal injuries on decedent, whodied a horrific and excruciating death.” The complaint does not specify how much the family is seeking in monetary damages.",

                    "text": "It’s an emotional day for Pixar and parent company Disney. On Wednesday, Inside Out 2 passed up Incredibles 2 ($1.242 billion) to become the top-grossing Pixar title of all time at the worldwide box office, not adjusted for inflation. That puts it at No. 4 on the overall list of top-grossing animated films, and the climb is far from done, meaning it could ultimately rank No. 1. Inside Out 2 finished Tuesday with $1.251 billion in global ticket sales, including $543.5 million in North America, where it’s already the third-biggest animated pic of all time, and $708 million internationally. Among all films, it has surpassed Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight to rank No. 17 on the list of the top-grossing movies of all time domestically. Back on the all-time animation list, the movie is within a day of overtaking Walt Disney Animation’s Frozen ($1.274 billion), and is also virtually assured of jumping Illumination and Universal’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie ($1.361 billion). Whether it can overtake Frozen II ($1.451 billion) is the biggest question mark, but many believe it can. Inside Out 2 has yet to open in Japan, where the forecast is sunny (in South Korea, it has earned nearly $50 million, a staggering sum that Disney believes bodes well for Japan). Throughout Asia, Europe and North America, the film is being fueled not only by families, but also by teenagers and younger female adults who grew up watching the first Inside Out, released in 2015. The sequel is also doing historic business across Latin America. Domestically, Inside Out 2 will pass up Super Mario ($575 million) next week, leaving only Incredibles 2 to conquer (that film topped out at $609 million in North America. Directed by Kelsey Mann, the sequel introduces a whole new cast of emotions who are brought into “head”-quarters when the story’s young heroine, Riley, becomes a teenager. Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust aren’t so sure how to feel about the arrival of Anxiety, Envy, Ennui and Embarrassment. The movie has become a cultural talking point about the emotional changes puberty brings, and is being championed by many educators and psychologists as a teaching moment. Inside Out 2, earning stellar reviews and a record-best audience score, has shattered numerous records since its release in early June, including crossing $1 billion club at the global box office in record time for an animated film, or just 19 days. The Pixar film is by far the top-grossing film of 2024 to date, and the first movie since Barbie almost a year ago to join the billion-dollar club. Among animated movies, it’s the 11th film to achieve the milestone. Disney dominates that list, laying claim to eight of those releases, whether Pixar or Walt Disney Animation titles. Inside Out 2 is a needed win for Pixar, which suffered a major setback when three of its movies were sent straight to streaming by the previous regime at Disney and before the return of Bob Iger as CEO. Amy Poehler — who plays Joy — leads the ensemble voice cast. The roster of stars includes Maya Hawke, Kensington Tallman, Liza Lapira, Tony Hale, Lewis Black, Phyllis Smith, Ayo Edebiri, Lilimar, Grace Lu, Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green, Adèle Exarchopoulos, Diane Lane, Kyle MacLachlan, Paul Walter Hauser and Yvette Nicole Brown. In 2015, Inside Out topped out at $858.8 million globally.",

                    "text": "Disney and Pixar have just registered a new core memory thanks to the box office success of Inside Out 2. After the animated sequel previously crossed the $1 billion mark in global ticket sales after just two weeks in wide release, the studio announced Wednesday that Inside Out 2 has become the highest-grossing Pixar movie of all time. The movie added $17.4 million on Tuesday, pushing its worldwide total to just under $1.252 billion — passing the final haul of 2018's Incredibles 2, which pulled in $1.243 billion (unadjusted for inflation) across its entire theatrical run. In North America, Inside Out 2 has earned $543.5 million, making it the top-earning movie of the year so far, with an additional $708 million coming from international markets. Compared to the earnings of all animated films, Inside Out 2 stands at No. 5 on the all-time list, with the 2019 Lion King remake taking the top spot with $1.663 billion, followed by Frozen II with $1.454 billion, The Super Mario Bros. Movie with $1.362 billion, and the original Frozen with $1.29 billion — all totals that are also unadjusted for inflation. The film has room to grow in the weeks ahead, as it's still performing well at domestic theaters one month after its debut, and has yet to open in Japan, where it hits theaters on Aug. 1.

                    "text": "It's safe to say all the emotions at the Inside Out 2 headquarters are overwhelmed with happiness. Nearly one month after its Friday, June 14 release, the animated film has surpassed Incredibles 2 in revenue, officially becoming the highest-grossing movie in Pixar's history. According to Variety, Inside Out 2 has now earned $1.25 billion globally, beating out Incredibles 2's $1.24 billion global box office record. This achievement also makes the film the fourth highest-grossing animated movie of all time. Only Frozen ($1.29 billion), The Super Mario Bros. Movie ($1.36 billion) and Frozen II ($1.45 billion) have made more than Inside Out 2. The sequel film quickly bested the overall gross of its predecessor, 2015’s Inside Out, which earned $859 million worldwide. The milestone comes as no surprise as The Walt Disney Company previously announced that Inside Out 2 is the fastest animated film to reach $1 billion at the worldwide box office — a feat achieved less than three weeks after its release. It is now one of only 11 animated titles to have crossed the $1 billion mark and the first film of any kind to achieve the milestone since July 2023's Barbie. Inside Out 2 follows a now-13-year-old Riley as she navigates new emotions during puberty and prepares to enter high school. It was directed by Kelsey Mann. While the coming-of-age story still features the five emotions seen in the first film (Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust), it introduces the more complex feelings of Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, Ennui and Nostalgia. Shortly after the follow-up film was first announced, Amy Poehler, who voices Joy, told PEOPLE that the first film practically \"set itself up for a sequel.\" The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now! \"At the very end of the original, Joy has that great moment where she's like, 'Finally, everything the way it's supposed to be.' Then we see that big puberty button, 'Should we press this?' We do press it in the second movie,\" said Poehler in September 2022. Making it finally come to fruition is something she had been working on for years.

On Wednesday, July 10, McConaughey, 54, shared a close-up photo of himself to Instagram showing his right eye completely swollen shut. While the actor did not specify exactly what happened to him, he hinted at an unfortunate incident with a bee with a punny caption: \"bee swell.\" Despite the alarming eye injury, McConaughey appeared otherwise in good spirits in the photo and held a grin for the camera. Aside from McConaughey's apparent bee incident, the actor has been busy as of late: he and his wife Camila Alves McConaughey shared birthday wishes to their eldest son Levi on Sunday, July 7, by sharing a montage of photos of the 16-year-old with his parents and a voiceover message. \"Alright Levi, coming on that age, buddy. About to be out on your own,\" the Interstellar star said in part during his voice over. \"Me and your mom hope we've done as good of a job as we can.

Matthew and Camila also share two younger kids: daughter Vida, 14, and son Livingston, 11. In June, McConaughey admitted during a conversation with fellow Texas native Glen Powell for Interview magazine that he once took a two-years long break from working in Hollywood after he felt he was struggling to book movie roles outside of the romantic comedy genre, where he made early 2000s classics like 2003's How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. \"Dude, it was scary. I had long talks with my wife about needing to find a new vocation,\" he shared of the hiatus, recalling that he told his wife at various points during this time that he was considering teaching high school, studying to conduct music or working as a \"wildlife guide.\" \"It was scary. The days are long — the sense of insignificance,\" McConaughey added at the time. \"But I made up my mind that that’s what I needed to do, so I wasn’t going to pull the parachute and quit the mission I was on. But it was scary, because I didn’t know if I was ever going to get out of the desert.\" The Oscar-winning actor last appeared on the big screen when he reprised his voice role as Buster Moon in 2021's animated Sing 2; he most recently appeared in Zach Bryan's music video for his song \"Nine Ball.\"",

Others thirsted over his looks despite his swollen eye. “You know something even with this eye a mess you still are beautiful,” one user penned. “Still handsome,” another wrote. McConaughey’s bee sting comes the same week he celebrated his eldest son Levi’s 16th birthday by sharing some advice via a heartfelt Instagram video. “Alright Levi, coming on that age, buddy. About to be out on your own,” the sentimental father, 54, began in a voiceover. “Me and your mom hope we’ve done as good of a job as we can.

Know when to say yes, know when to say no, know when to say maybe.” Wrapping up his touching note, McConaughey continued, “See the good in everybody else, but know that not everyone else is always paying attention. Take your time. Enjoy the journey.” The “Dallas Buyers Club” actor shares Levi with his wife, Camila Alves. They’re also parents to Vida, 14, and Livingston, 11. They celebrated their 12th wedding anniversary on June 10, which the actor marked with a sweet photo of himself kissing Alves’ forehead. “thank you #happyanniversary,” he simply captioned the tribute.",

The How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days star said that, when they moved, the difference was immediate. \"Ritual came back,\" he told Southern Living in March, \"whether that was Sunday church, sports, dinner together as a family every night, or staying up after that telling stories in the kitchen, sitting at the island pouring drinks and nibbling while retelling them all in different ways than we told them before.\" Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more. His Texas locale also gives McConaughey easier access to football games played by his beloved University of Texas at Austin Longhorns. The actor is often spotted cheering on the team from the sidelines. McConaughey's upcoming projects include The Rivals of Amziah King, a crime movie with Kurt Russell and Riverdale alum Cole Sprouse, set in rural Oklahoma, as well as The Lost Bus. The latter drama, which costars America Ferrera, fresh off her Oscar nomination for Barbie, focuses on California's 2018 Camp Fire disaster.",

The faulty inflators could potentially explode, posing danger to car passengers.The U.S. auto safety regulator stated that an explosion of the inflator could potentially injure the driver and the passengers since it could send sharp metal fragments straight to the occupants. In some cases, the agency said that it could even cause death of the driver and passengers.Reuters stated that the recall of the faulty airbag inflators, PSDI-5, which were manufactured by the Japanese company Takata Corp., is considered as one of the most complex recall process.There have been more than 30 deaths attributed to the Takata airbag inflators -- 27 in the U.S., as per Forbes. It also harmed at least 400 more, according to the NHTSA, including the driver of a 2014 BMW X3 who suffered from shrapnel injuries when the airbag exploded in October.There have been hundreds of injuries attributed to the Takata airbags found on vehicles of different automakers. More than 100 million cars that were fitted with the same were recalled over the past decade.In 2017, Takata filed for bankruptcy after the airbag scandal shocked the automotive industry.In the most recent recall made by BMW, it covered models that were manufactured between 2006 to 2012. It included BMW 3 Series Sedans and Sportswagon models. These models may have PSDI-5 inflators that were installed by owners even though that they were not entirely approved by the German automaker as a replacement part.BMW has informed the NHTSA that it was not aware of any reports about injuries or accidents caused by the airbag defect. The automaker said, however, that it will be notifying drivers starting Aug. 10, and that the dealers will be offering free replacement of airbag modules.The NHTSA noted that investigations made by Takata, as well as independent laboratories, found the PSDI-5 inflator as susceptible to rupture following years of being exposed to continuous high temperatures and humidity.",

                    "text": "Disaster prompted repercussions. Gregg Berhalter was fired as head coach of the United States Men’s Soccer Team, Fox Sports reported Wednesday. It ends an extremely polarizing five-and-a-half seasons in charge for Berhalter, which ended in an embarrassing group stage exit at the 2024 Copa America – hosted on U.S. soil. The USMNT will now have a new leader ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. will co-host along with Mexico and Canada. Berhalter, 50, took over in December, 2018 — one year after the USMNT infamously failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. He’s overseen a “golden generation” of American players, a young core the majority of which plays at the highest levels in Europe. A former USMNT player himself, Berhalter as manager won two continental championships — the Nations League title in 2021 and the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup, both times defeating Mexico in the final. His team qualified for the 2022 World Cup, where the team subsequently reached the Round of 16 before falling to the Netherlands. Berhalter’s contract expired following the World Cup in December, 2022. After a search for a new manager, the USSF announced in June, 2023 that Berhalter was returning as manager. But in his first major tournament since being re-hired, the Copa America, the USMNT was humiliated. After beating Bolivia in the opener, the USMNT lost to Panama and Uruguay and became the first-ever host nation to be eliminated in the group stage in tournament history. The USSF announced following the team’s exit that it would evaluate the head-coaching position. And on Monday, they decided for a new chapter. Berhalter’s tenure was also marred by a brief scandal. After one of the team’s more promising players, Gio Reyna, did not receive much playing time at the 2022 World Cup, Berhalter, while speaking at a leadership conference, alluded to a player he had to discipline and nearly send home due to bad behavior. Berhalter did not name Reyna by name, but it was clear the latter was whom Berhalter was referring to. Berhalter claimed he believed he was speaking off-the-record, but Reyna subsequently blasted Berhalter and claimed that the ex-coach told him the incident would remain in-house. And soon after, the USSF found that Reyna’s parents, Claudio and Danielle, attempted to retaliate against Berhalter. Danielle contacted the USSF about an alleged fight Berhalter got into with his now-wife, Rosalind, 30 years prior when the two were teammates at the University of North Carolina. Danielle Reyna played with Rosalind Berhalter at North Carolina, while Berhalter and Claudio Reyna were teammates on the USMNT. Berhalter claimed he was being blackmailed by the Reynas. And the USSF’s investigation and a report by a law firm determined that Berhalter did not improperly withhold information about that 1992 incident, paving the way for him to be re-hired in 2023. Reyna was a staple in Berhalter’s lineups at the Copa America, but now the two will no longer be intertwined. The USMNT now looks for its new manager as Jesse Marsch, an American manager whom the USMNT snubbed last year in favor of bringing back Berhalter, leads Canada to the Copa America semifinal. Perhaps the most important cycle in USMNT history lies ahead in the near future. But first, finding the man to guide them there.",

                    "text": "The Gregg Berhalter era is over. According to Doug McIntyre of Fox Sports, Berhalter is out as the manager of the U.S. Men's National Team after failing to advance past the group stage at this summer's Copa América tournament, Berhalter's time at the helm of the USMNT has been controversial, to say the least. Positives included a number of big wins over hated rivals Mexico and advancing past the group stage at the 2022 World Cup. But the United States almost never beat top teams in the Berhalter era and has appeared to stagnate despite arguably having the best young generation of payers in USMNT history, led by Christian Pulisic. That was compounded by the rough showing at the Copa América, a result that led to major USMNT supporter's groups calling for Berhalter's firing. A tipping point had been reached. \"Our tournament performance fell short of our expectations,\" the United States Soccer Federation said in a statement at the time. \"We must do better. We will be conducting a comprehensive review of our performance in Copa America and how best to improve the team and results as we look towards the 2026 World Cup.\" There was also the fact that Berhalter was out of the job for six months in 2022 after his contract ran out, as the USSF investigated claims from Danielle and Claudio Reyna that Berhalter assaulted his now-wife, Rosalind, while the pair were in college. He was ultimately rehired in June 2023. And despite a number of supporters and pundits believing he should have been replaced far earlier than now, he also had his allies, namely among the players. \"I see no issue with the direction we're heading,\" goalkeeper Matt Turner told reporters after the Copa América debacle. \"When you have a fight like that on the pitch in every single game we're in in this tournament, it speaks volumes to how the manager prepares us.\" \"I believe we all have a comfort with Gregg and we all understand him and we've had him for a long time,\" Weston McKennie added. \"He's progressed the team very far from where we started off four or five years ago. I think the connection that we have with him is what's important, in having a coach that players that would run through a brick wall for him, players that listen to him.\" A new era for United States soccer is coming, as the country searches for the right manager to prepare the squad for the 2026 World Cup. It will be a crucial hire for the future of the program.",

                    "title": "Report: US Soccer Fired Gregg Berhalter After The USMNT Crashed And Burned At Copa America",
                    "text": "The United States men’s national team will have a new manager leading them into the 2026 World Cup on home soil. According to Doug McIntyre of Fox Sports, U.S. Soccer made the decision to sack manager Gregg Berhalter just over one year after it announced that he would come back to lead the team following the expiration of his contract and a lengthy search for his replacement. The decision was made after the USMNT flamed out of the group stage at Copa America, which was widely viewed as an opportunity to show that the team took a step forward following its elimination in the round of 16 at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Back then, Berhalter led the team through a tricky group before falling to European power The Netherlands. This time around, the Americans fumbled their final opportunity to make any sort of major statement in a competitive international tournament ahead of 2026. The team started off group play with a 2-0 win against Bolivia that was defined by their inability to finish off chances and run up the score, before a shambolic game against Panama in which standout winger Timothy Weah received an inexplicable red card 18 minutes in. While Folarin Balogun was able to put them ahead despite being a man down not long after, the U.S. almost immediately conceded, then spent the entire second half letting Panama have the ball before José Fajardo scored with about 10 minutes left in the game. It put the team in a situation where they needed to beat South American juggernaut Uruguay, one of the favorites to win the entire tournament, and hope Panama did not obliterate Bolivia if they were to go through to the knockout stage. Try as they might, the Americans could not break down the resilient Uruguayan defense, and thanks to a controversial goal on a free kick, Uruguay was able to secure a 1-0 win that sent the United States home. The calls for Berhalter’s job began almost immediately. Whether it was the Fox Sports panel after the game, USMNT fans on Twitter who have been skeptical of Berhalter since the convoluted process that led to his initial hiring in 2018, or those in attendance in Kansas City who chanted “Fire Berhalter,” American fans wanted someone to take responsibility for this, and because you can’t trade out the players from the so-called “golden generation” who have struggled to live up to that reputation once they step outside of North American competition, the obvious choice was the manager whose stated goal from day one has been to change the way the world views American soccer. In a way, that has happened during the Berhalter era, but not in the way he imagined. For years, the USMNT has been defined by a willingness to play as a collective, to run through a brick wall if it meant being the first player to get to the ball, in running fast and trying hard and white knuckling it against more talented teams that hammer you, but finding a way through sheer determination to get the goal(s) that you need to gut out a result. It’s not the most aesthetically pleasing style of play in the world, and at some point their luck would run out and they’d get blitzed by Argentina or Belgium or someone, but you knew when the United States stepped onto the pitch, the other team was going to have to earn a result after 90 absolutely miserable minutes of being dragged into the mud. Berhalter wanted the team to take a more progressive, front foot approach that resembles some of the top club teams in the world. He spoke frequently about the team’s system, which was designed to create chances by having players do their jobs, and if they managed to piece everything together within said system, opportunities to score goals would come. The games where this worked looked beautiful, but too often, the team would line up against top teams and come up short, and the benchmark for an international team — how you perform in major tournaments — looked pretty similar to how it’s always looked once the team got outside of CONCACAF if you just looked at the results. Much was made about the lack of a signature win against a team other than the least talented Mexico team in decades during Berhalter’s tenure. There must, of course, be responsibility put on the players, and the necessary criticism that comes from, well, everything. The golden generation moniker has been thrown around for years, and while most of the players who make up said golden generation have yet to enter their primes, it’s nevertheless a collection of talented individuals who have spent years playing alongside one another in both the youth and senior national team set-ups. And yet, when the games kick off, the chemistry that you’d presume was built up for years over years never seems to be there. The question is whether that is the fault of the players, the fault of Berhalter, the fault of their clubs, the fault of U.S. Soccer as an institution, the fault of the fans or the pundit class or god knows whomever else. Maybe it’s everyone and everything, all formed into one disgusting blob of hope and aspiration that ran into the harsh reality that men’s soccer in this country is not — and never will be, based on our current trajectory — as good as we’d like. Or maybe it was just because Gregg Berhalter wasn’t a good enough manager for a national team. At the very least, we’ll figure out if that was the singular thing holding the USMNT back. And if more went into it, well, maybe U.S. Soccer will spend the next two years before anything and everything it does gets put under the most intense microscope in the sport trying to fix those problems, too.",

                    "text": "U.S. men's national team head coach Gregg Berhalter is out just over a week after the team's shock elimination from the 2024 Copa America in the group stage, according to Fox Sports. The U.S. entered the cup with relatively high expectations, a bare minimum of making it out of the group stage and showing competitiveness against stronger opposition, but a stunning loss to Panama in the second game of the tournament expedited their exit before Uruguay put the final nail in the team's coffin, and ultimately in Berhalter's time with the team. Needing to better Panama's result versus Bolivia in the final match against Uruguay, the Americans failed to do that against one of the tournament's favorites, forcing the need to hit the reset button just two years away from hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The USMNT coach could not produce a single top-tier victory during his five years in charge aside from the domination of struggling rival Mexico. He had five top-20 wins (in terms of FIFA rankings), but four were against Mexico and one was against Iran. As for the next step, it's anyone's guess, but fans wonder if this is now the time to go after a big-name boss. There are certainly many possible options out there. The U.S. has been linked in the past with names such as Jose Mourinho, while the likes of World Cup winner Joachim Low and France legend Zinedine Zidane are potentially available. The early fan favorite is certainly former Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, while MLS coaches such as Columbus Crew's Wilfried Nancy and LAFC's Steve Cherundolo are also names to watch. CBS Sports will have more on this breaking news story.",

                    "title": "U.S. Soccer right to fire Gregg Berhalter but not blameless in Copa America disaster",
                    "text": "For the better part of a decade, the U.S. men's national team have insisted things can only go up from here. The talking point started as a demand to improve after the failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup and the program eventually lived up to the billing, ushering in a talented group of new players that made the knockout rounds of the 2022 World Cup. That trip to Qatar was supposed to freshen the call to action of an upward trajectory, teasing that it was just the start of something special. A year and a half since, though, the promise of progress remains glaringly unfulfilled. And so, the U.S. Soccer Federation's decision to fire coach Gregg Berhalter on Wednesday feels justified in the wake of the USMNT's group stage exit from the Copa America. The tournament did not go according to plan at all for the U.S., who hoped a berth at this expanded edition of the South American championship would serve as a proving ground for their aspirations and eyed a deep run after being placed in a favorable group. Instead, the USMNT were unable to string together a single performance that would convince onlookers that this was a team well and truly on the rise, losing twice in three games including an ill-fated matchup against underdogs Panama. The blame does not rest on Berhalter's shoulders alone, but the last 10 months of work essentially erased the undeniable strides the team made during his first three years in the job. The head coach's second stint in charge, which began last September after his initial contract expired at the end of 2022, demonstrated the stark difference between starting from scratch and reaching the next level. There was little Berhalter could do to take his team to the next gear and long before they failed at the Copa America, the cracks began to show. First came a 2-1 loss to Trindad and Tobago in the Concacaf Nations League quarterfinals last November. The deficit was not costly enough to their aggregate score but Sergino Dest's reckless red card derailed the USMNT's performance, which was unspectacular despite being the heavy favorites in that match. Then came a 3-1 win in extra time over Jamaica in the semifinals in March, when the U.S. conceded in the first minute and needed an own goal in the final minute to force extra time and win the game. Just a month ago, a 2-0 deficit against Colombia just 20 minutes into a friendly turned into a 5-1 loss by the final whistle. The loss to Panama was a death knell rather than the first sign of trouble, and it is difficult to expunge that string of performances from Berhalter's record. Despite having the benefit of familiarity with a player pool that he has worked with since 2019, Berhalter seemed unable to tactically elevate his group to become greater than the sum of their parts. They seemed instead to regress in recent months, failing on occasions in which they were the favorites and crumbling under the pressure against top-ranked opponents. It is hard to credit Berhalter with any major accomplishments -- as much optimism has followed the group of players he coached, this team merely met expectations. They never found a way to go one step further, as Berhalter's paltry record against top 20 teams will demonstrate -- he has just five wins against teams in that category, four of which came against Mexico and the fifth came against Iran. Overperforming expectations is a difficult task with an imperfect player pool and considering the things outside of Berhalter's control, such as the players' club situations. Rising above those challenges, though, is ultimately the job of the USMNT coach, especially one who aimed \" to do something that no U.S. team has done before\" at the 2026 World Cup on home soil. Berhalter's poor showings, though, mean blame also falls to the U.S. Soccer higher-ups who re-hired him last summer. Despite Berhalter's work during his first spell in charge, his return to the national team was not universally praised -- in fact, many responded to the news by admitting he had work to do to prove he deserved to resume the role. After the doomed Copa America experience, it feels like U.S. Soccer wasted two years, first waiting to re-hire Berhalter and then to see him demonstrate that he was not up for the job. The failed Berhalter experiment of the last year ultimately forces questions of the recruitment process, too. It was the first big coaching hire from new U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker, who joined the federation last April and reportedly deferred to the players after they publicly advocated for Berhalter's return. It remains unclear how many high-caliber coaches were in the running, though new Canada manager Jesse Marsch said he \"wasn't treated very well\" by U.S. Soccer as they explored their options. His run to the semifinals with Canada just weeks after taking that job will sting for many in U.S. Soccer circles because he accomplished the improbable task of punching above the team's weight in record time. Marsch is perhaps not the only candidate that may have been a good fit, but he was arguably the only person who felt both realistic and exciting. The drab reality is that U.S. Soccer is unlikely to do much better than him, either. Many have spent the last week name-dropping Jurgen Klopp as if they can manifest his arrival, but it feels unlikely even if U.S. Soccer can come up with the funds to make it happen. It is worth remembering that a high-profile coach will not be able to fix the problems that are bigger than Berhalter. That, though, is not to suggest that the USMNT cannot solve their issues in time for the 2026 World Cup, but the solution is unlikely to be a glamorous one, nor does it have to be. Finding a better tactician than Berhalter is paramount and so is someone who can address the feelings of comfort that have plagued the USMNT in recent years, something veteran defender Tim Ream admitted following the team's Copa America exit. \"It's a fantastic group, as everybody knows,\" he said, per Univision, \"It's very, very close but sometimes, the intensity falls through the cracks.\" It will require U.S. Soccer to do something it has not done in a little while, though -- make a choice that raises few questions, and quickly. U.S. Soccer took a year-plus to hire Berhalter, a process that will always have an asterisk next to it because his brother Jay was the federation's chief commercial officer at the time. It also took the federation six months to reinstate Berhalter, delayed by the changing sporting directors and an investigation into a decades-old domestic violence incident that came up in Berhalter's family feud with ex-national team players Claudio and Danielle Reyna. With less than two years left on the clock before the U.S. welcomes the world's best teams for the World Cup, the onus is on the federation to live up to the expectations they set for themselves -- and do away with the sour taste of disappointment from the last two years.",

                    "text": "A court in Russia ordered the arrest of the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny during a hearing Tuesday that was conducted in absentia as part of a sweeping Kremlin crackdown on the opposition. Yulia Navalnaya, who lives abroad, would face arrest if and when she returns to Russia. Moscow’s Basmanny District Court ruled to arrest Navalnaya on charges of alleged involvement in an extremist group. Navalny, the fiercest political foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin, died in February in an Arctic penal colony while serving a 19-year sentence on extremism charges that he had condemned as politically motivated. Authorities said he became ill after a walk but have otherwise given no details on Navalny’s death. Navalny was imprisoned after returning to Moscow in January 2021 from Germany, where he had been recuperating from the 2020 nerve agent poisoning that he blamed on the Kremlin. Navalnaya has accused Putin of her husband’s death and vowed to continue his activities. Russian officials have vehemently denied involvement in Navalny’s poisoning and death. Navalnaya mocked the court’s order on social media platform X, saying that it’s Putin who should be be prosecuted. Her spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, described the court’s ruling as a recognition of her “merits.” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz noted on X that Navalnaya is carrying on her husband’s legacy and denounced the Moscow court’s ruling as “an arrest warrant against the desire for freedom and democracy.” Russian authorities haven’t specified the charges against Navalnaya. They appear to relate to authorities designating Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption as an extremist organization. The 2021 court ruling that outlawed Navalny’s group forced his close associates and team members to leave Russia. A number of journalists have been jailed on similar charges in recent months in relation to their coverage of Navalny. The Kremlin’s crackdown on opposition activists, independent journalists and ordinary Russians critical of it has intensified after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",

                    "text": "A court in Moscow on Tuesday ordered Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of late Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, arrested in absentia for two months. The court accused Navalnaya, who lives outside Russia, of participating in an “extremist” group. The decision means she would face certain arrest if she set foot in the country. Navalnaya, 47, has stepped into the spotlight following her husband’s death in an Arctic penal colony in February and said she will continue the fight for what Navalny called the “beautiful Russia of the future.” Writing on X on Tuesday, Navalnaya told her supporters to focus not on the court order against her, but on the battle against Russian President Vladimir Putin. “When you write about this, please don’t forget to write the main thing: Vladimir Putin is a murderer and a war criminal,” she wrote. “His place is in prison, and not somewhere in The Hague, in a cozy cell with a TV, but in Russia – in the same (penal) colony and the same 2 by 3-meter cell in which he killed Alexei.” The Kremlin has denied ordering Navalny killed. Since her husband’s death, Navalnaya has met a number of senior Western leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden in San Francisco. The U.S.-based nonprofit group Human Rights Foundation named Navalnaya its chair last week, and she said she would use the new role to step up her the struggle waged by her husband against Putin. “We will take on board everything that can be useful to fight Putin, to fight for the beautiful Russia of the future,” Navalnaya said on X.",

                    "text": "A court in Moscow has ordered Yulia Navalnaya, the wife of late Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny, to be arrested in absentia, her spokesperson said Tuesday. The Basmanny District Court in Moscow accused Navalnaya, who now lives outside Russia, of “participation in an extremist organization,” her spokesperson Kira Yarmysh said in a post on social media. She has also been added to an international wanted list, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. In addition, the court granted a request by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation to detain Navalnaya. The period of detention would be calculated from the moment of possible extradition to Russian territory or from her detention on Russian territory, according to a press release. Navalnaya does not live in Russia. Alexey Navalny died on February 16 in the penal colony in Siberia where he was serving a 19-year sentence after being found guilty of creating an extremist community, financing extremist activists and various other crimes in August. He was already serving sentences of 11-and-a-half years in a maximum security facility on fraud and other charges he had always denied and claimed were politically motivated. Navalny was Russia’s highest-profile opposition leader and spent years criticizing Putin, who has been in power for nearly a quarter of a century, at great personal risk. His death came weeks before the country’s presidential elections scheduled to begin nationwide on March 15, which is widely seen by the international community as little more than a formality that will secure Putin a fifth term in power. ‘Putin is a murderer’ Navalny’s death was met with grief and anger across the world as well as inside Russia, where the smallest acts of political dissent carry huge risks. He returned to Russia in 2021 from Germany, where he had been treated after being poisoned with Novichok, a Soviet-era nerve agent. On arrival Navalny was swiftly arrested – on charges he dismissed as politically motivated – and spent the rest of his life in prison. His wife, Yulia Navalnaya, accused Russian President Vladimir Putin in February of being responsible for his death and indicated she would pick up her husband’s mantle, for a “happy, beautiful Russia.” Navalnaya posted an eight-minute video on her dead husband’s social media outlets, saying Putin “killed the father of my children, Putin took away the most precious thing that was my closest and most beloved person.” She said Russian authorities were “hiding” Navalny’s body in an attempt to disguise the cause of his death – “lying pathetically” and waiting for “traces of another of Putin’s Novichoks to disappear.” The Kremlin rejected any allegations of involvement in Navalny’s death. Reacting to the court’s decision on Tuesday, Navalnaya reiterated claims of Putin’s involvement in the death of her husband. “His place is in prison, and not somewhere in The Hague, in a cozy cell with a TV, but in Russia – in the same colony and the same 2 by 3 meter cell in which he killed Alexey,” she said in a social media post. “Oh, won’t there be the usual procedure? A foreign agent, then the opening of a criminal case, then an arrest?! When you write about this, please do not forget to write the main thing: Vladimir Putin is a murderer and a war criminal.” (Copyright (c) 2024 CNN. All Rights Reserved.

Yulia Navalnaya, who lives abroad, would face arrest if and when she returns to Russia. Moscow’s Basmanny District Court ruled to arrest Navalnaya on charges of alleged involvement in an extremist group. ZELENSKYY SAYS ACTION AGAINST PUTIN CANNOT WAIT UNTIL US ELECTION IN NOVEMBER: 'STEP OUT OF THE SHADOWS' Navalny, the fiercest political foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin, died in February in an Arctic penal colony while serving a 19-year sentence on extremism charges that he had condemned as politically motivated. Authorities said he became ill after a walk but have otherwise given no details on Navalny's death. Navalny was imprisoned after returning to Moscow in January 2021 from Germany, where he had been recuperating from the 2020 nerve agent poisoning that he blamed on the Kremlin. Navalnaya has accused Putin of her husband’s death and vowed to continue his activities. Russian officials have vehemently denied involvement in Navalny's poisoning and death. Navalnaya mocked the court's order on social media platform X, saying that it's Putin who should be be prosecuted. Her spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, described the court's ruling as a recognition of her \"merits.\" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz noted on X that Navalnaya is carrying on her husband's legacy and denounced the Moscow court's ruling as \"an arrest warrant against the desire for freedom and democracy.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Russian authorities haven’t specified the charges against Navalnaya. They appear to relate to authorities designating Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption as an extremist organization. The 2021 court ruling that outlawed Navalny's group forced his close associates and team members to leave Russia. A number of journalists have been jailed on similar charges in recent months in relation to their coverage of Navalny. The Kremlin's crackdown on opposition activists, independent journalists and ordinary Russians critical of it has intensified after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",

A statement from China customs shared on Tuesday, July 9, and cited by the outlets, noted: \"Once opened, each bag was found to contain living snakes in all kinds of shapes, sizes and colors. After counting, a total of 104 snakes were found.” Five species of snakes were discovered in total, including “the milk snake, western hognose snake, corn snake, Texas rat snake and bullsnake,” according to CNN. The outlet notes that the incident happened “a few days ago” and that it’s not clear if the man was arrested. However, the customs agency reportedly added in their statement, \"Those who break the rules will be... held liable in accordance with the law.” In April, a similar incident occurred at Miami International Airport when Transportation Security Administration officials found a bag of snakes hidden in a traveler’s pants. That man was attempting to conceal the snakes in a green camouflage bag when TSA officials caught him. On their official X (formerly Twitter) account, the TSA shared a statement about the incident and included photos of the reptiles that they found. “Officers at @iflymia detected this bag of snakes hidden in a passenger’s pants at a checkpoint on Fri, April 26. @TSA called our @CBPSoutheast and Miami-Dade Police partners in to assist, and the snakes were turned over to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission,” they wrote in their statement.

The passenger was attempting to go on an international flight and was denied boarding after the snakes were found, WFTV reported at the time. Per the U.S. Department of Transportation’s official website, \"federal and state governments impose restrictions on transporting live animals. In addition, each airline establishes its own company policy for the proper handling of the animals they transport.\"",

The man tried to bring the snakes from Hong Kong into the Chinese border city of Shenzhen, officials said. The incident, while bizarre, is indicative of a larger problem, particularly in China, which is one of the most prolific hubs for illegal wildlife trade. This environmental and wildlife smuggling poses threats to native animal species and represents a $20 billion annual black market — the third-largest illegal trading syndicate behind drugs and counterfeit food, according to Moody’s. In a 2023 report, Interpol said that poaching and illegal wildlife were responsible not only for significant environmental damage, but also some 100 rangers are killed by illegal poachers each year.",

Some Democrats are calling for Biden to drop out of the race, while others are vowing to stick by his campaign. On Wednesday, July 10, a major Democrat in the entertainment world — actor George Clooney — called for members of his party to find another presidential candidate. In a guest op-ed published by the New York Times, Clooney writes, \"I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\" READ MORE: 'One of the oldest dictator tricks': Here’s why Trump is lying about Project 2025 Clooney continues, \"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\" Democrats, Clooney argues, need to be realistic and nominate someone is better equipped to defeat Trump in November. \"Let's hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others,\" the actor says. \"Let's agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\" Clooney adds, \"Would it be messy? Yes. Democracy is messy. But would it enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out? It sure would…. Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020.

                    "text": "George Clooney directly told his “friend” Joe Biden to end his re-election campaign Wednesday in a New York Times op-ed headlined, “I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee.” Clooney became the highest-profile name of any kind to demand Biden, 81, drop out, saying that he had seen close up the president’s decline just three weeks ago when he co-hosted a glittering Hollywood fundraiser. The Hollywood star and powerful Democratic benefactor, who said Biden was his first choice in 2016 and who excused the president’s slipping poll numbers in 2021, comparing Biden to a “battered child,” pulled no punches on Wednesday. “We are not going to win in November with this president,” he declared. “I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he’s won many of the battles he’s faced,” he continued. Clooney pleaded with the Democratic party leaders “to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw” in Biden’s disastrous debate performance against Trump. At the glitzy fundraiser weeks before, Biden was just as bad, Clooney wrote. He was “not the Joe ‘big F-ing deal’ Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020,” he wrote. “Pod Save America” co-host Jon Favreau, who was also in attendance, recently agreed, describing Biden as “debate-style bad.” “We all walked out of that fundraiser here in L.A. and we’re talking to each other and to people around us who were, you know, in politics and we’re like, that was chilling. It was very, very, very unnerving,” Favreau’s co-host Tommy Vietor, who was also at the fundraiser, added. Clooney wrote that “every senator and congress member and governor that I’ve spoken with in private” concurred with him that Biden was a liability not only for the presidency. “We won’t win the House, and we’re going to lose the Senate,” if he stays at the top of the ticket, he added. “Most of our members of Congress are opting to wait and see if the dam breaks. But the dam has broken. We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth.” Clooney wrote, specifically urging Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Rep. Nancy Pelosi to call on Biden to step aside. Clooney also floated Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Vice President Kamala Harris as “strong” alternates who should be “stepping forward to stand and tell us why they’re best qualified to lead this country.” “Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.” Clooney suggested. “Would it be messy? Yes. Democracy is messy. But would it enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out? It sure would.” Clooney closed the letter with praise for the president: “Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.”",

                    "text": "George Clooney, an outspoken Democrat and supporter of Joe Biden, is the latest in a line of public figures to call upon the president to drop his re-election bid after a distressing debate performance late last month. The Academy-Award-winning actor in an opinion piece for the New York Times published on Wednesday argued that the Democratic Party is in desperate need of a new nominee in order to defeat former President Donald Trump in November. Clooney wrote of the \"profound moment\" the country is currently in, noting how just last month he hosted the \"single largest fundraiser supporting any Democratic candidate ever, for President Biden's re-election.\" \"I love Joe Biden,\" Clooney wrote. \"As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he’s won many of the battles he’s faced.\" \"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time,\" he continued. \"None of us can. It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe “big F—ing deal” Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\" Regarding the debate, in which the 81-year-old President stumbled continually, Clooney wrote that \"our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw.\" \"We’re all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we’ve opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question,\" he wrote. Clooney also claimed that his opinion was widely and quietly shared amongst Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill and elsewhere. \"This is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I’ve spoken with in private,\" he alleged. \"Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\" In favor of the sitting president, potential candidates could be Vice President Kamala Harris, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, amongst others, Clooney suggested. \"Joe Biden is a hero,\" the actor concluded. \"He saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.\"",

                    "title": "George Clooney Urges His Friend Joe Biden to ‘Save Democracy’ by Exiting 2024 Race: ‘One Battle He Cannot Win’",
                    "text": "George Clooney publicly pulled his support for Joe Biden’s 2024 presidential campaign on Wednesday, July 10, urging the White House to consider the impact of keeping him on the ballot. The liberal actor, 63, penned a passionate essay for The New York Times, in which he argues that Biden should quickly exit the 2024 race for the good of his own party. Clooney cites troublesome poll numbers suggesting that Americans lack confidence in Biden following his frail performance in the June 27 presidential debate against Donald Trump. In the article, Clooney calls himself a \"lifelong Democrat\" and reminds readers that he co-hosted the Biden campaign's star-studded Hollywood fundraiser only a few weeks ago, which he noted was the \"single largest fund-raiser supporting any Democratic candidate ever.\" \"It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe “big F-ing deal” Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020,\" Clooney said, \"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\" Clooney expressed his personal fondness for the current president, writing, \"I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he’s won many of the battles he’s faced.” However, the two-time Oscar winner said that \"the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time,” referencing the 81-year-old's age, which remains a top concern to voters. Addressing Biden's weak debate performance specifically, the actor said, \"Our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw. We’re all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we’ve opted to ignore every warning sign.\" He added that Biden’s primetime interview with George Stephanopoulos on July 5 — which the White House hoped would revive his candidacy — \"only reinforced what we saw the week before.\" Clooney called upon leading Democrats — specifically naming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — to put pressure on Biden to \"voluntarily step aside.\" (Within hours of the essay's publication, Politico reported that Jeffries told House Democrats he would relay their concerns to Biden.) According to Clooney, \"every single\" lawmaker he's spoken with has said that they worry Biden will not only lose in November, but that he will hurt Democratic candidates down the ballot and potentially give Republicans full control of Congress. Clooney suggested that some of the skeptical Democrats he's spoken with are still publicly backing Biden. Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Later in his essay, Clooney expressed optimism for the future of the political party if Biden steps aside, writing, \"We can easily foresee a group of several strong Democrats stepping forward to stand and tell us why they’re best qualified to lead this country and take on some of the deeply concerning trends we’re seeing from the revenge tour that Donald Trump calls a presidential campaign.\" The clock is ticking with the Democratic National Convention beginning on Aug. 19 — during which time the party will formally nominate its candidate — but Clooney insists that there’s still time to \"hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others\" who have been named as possible replacements. Clooney also requested that Democrats stay united if the ticket sees a switch-up, writing, \"Let’s agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\" The actor suggested that Biden stepping aside could \"enliven our party\" and \"wake up voters\" who have \"checked out.\" Clooney concluded the essay by expressing gratitude for the president — and a plea: \"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.\" Clooney’s essay comes as a slow trickle of liberal lawmakers break from the president. As of Wednesday afternoon, eight Democratic members of Congress have publicly called for Biden to drop out of the race, and many more have expressed doubts — including Pelosi, who has cautiously suggested that there's reason to be skeptical of Biden's candidacy. Several celebrities seem to share Clooney's fears, with author Stephen King writing on social media earlier this week, “Joe Biden has been a fine president, but it’s time for him—in the interests of the America he so clearly loves—to announce he will not run for re-election.” Emmy winner Rob Reiner praised Clooney for his essay, writing on social media, “My friend George Clooney has clearly expressed what many of us have been saying. We love and respect Joe Biden. We acknowledge all he has done for our country. But Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside.”",

                    "title": "Vending machines dispense ammunition in some grocery stores",
                    "text": "By Kimberly Chandler | Associated Press MONTGOMERY, Ala. — A company has installed computerized vending machines to sell ammunition in grocery stores in Alabama, Oklahoma and Texas, allowing patrons to pick up bullets along with a gallon of milk. American Rounds said their machines use an identification scanner and facial recognition software to verify the purchaser’s age and are as “quick and easy” to use as a computer tablet. But advocates worry that selling bullets out of vending machines will lead to more shootings in the U.S., where gun violence killed at least 33 people on Independence Day alone. The company maintains the age-verification technology means that the transactions are as secure, or more secure, than online sales, which may not require the purchaser to submit proof of age, or at retail stores, where there is a risk of shoplifting. “I’m very thankful for those who are taking the time to get to know us and not just making assumptions about what we’re about,” CEO Grant Magers said. “We are very pro-Second Amendment, but we are for responsible gun ownership, and we hope we’re improving the environment for the community.” There have been 15 mass killings involving a firearm so far in 2024, compared to 39 in 2023, according to a database maintained in a partnership of The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. “Innovations that make ammunition sales more secure via facial recognition, age verification, and the tracking of serial sales are promising safety measures that belong in gun stores, not in the place where you buy your kids milk,” said Nick Suplina, senior vice president for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety. “In a country awash in guns and ammo, where guns are the leading cause of deaths for kids, we don’t need to further normalize the sale and promotion of these products.” Magers said grocery stores and others approached the Texas-based company, which began in 2023, about the idea of selling ammunition through automated technology. The company has one machine in Alabama, four in Oklahoma and one in Texas, with plans for another in Texas and one in Colorado in the coming weeks, he said. “People I think got shocked when they thought about the idea of selling ammo at a grocery store,” Magers said. “But as we explained, how is that any different than Walmart?” Federal law requires a person to be 18 to buy shotgun and rifle ammunition and 21 to buy handgun ammunition. Magers said their machines require a purchaser to be at least 21. The machine works by requiring a customer to scan their driver’s license to validate that they are age 21 or older. The scan also checks that it is a valid license, he said. That is followed by a facial recognition scan to verify “you are who you are saying you are as a consumer,” he said. “At that point you can complete your transaction of your product and you’re off and going,” he said. “The whole experience takes a minute and a half once you are familiar with the machine.” The vending machine is another method of sale, joining retail stores and online retailers. A March report by Everytown for Gun Safety found that several major online ammunition retailers did not appear to verify their customers’ ages, despite requirements. Last year, an online retailer settled a lawsuit brought by families of those killed and injured in a 2018 Texas high school shooting. The families said the 17-year-old shooter was able to buy ammunition from the retailer who failed to verify his age. A Pennsylvania police officer created a company about 12 years ago that places bullet-vending machines in private gun clubs and ranges as a convenience for patrons. Those machines do not have the age verification mechanism but are only placed in locations with an age requirement to enter, Master Ammo owner Sam Piccinini said. Piccinini spoke with a company years ago about incorporating the artificial intelligence technology to verify a purchaser’s age and identity, but at the time it was cost-prohibitive, he said. For American Rounds, one machine had to be removed from a site in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, because of disappointing sales, Magers said. Magers said much of the early interest for the machines has been in rural communities where there may be few retailers that sell ammunition. The American Rounds machines are in Super C Mart and Fresh Value grocery stores in small cities, including Pell City, Alabama, which has a population over 13,600, and Noble, Oklahoma, where nearly 7,600 people live. “Someone in that community might have to drive an hour or an hour and a half to get supplied if they want to go hunting, for instance,” Margers said. “Our grocery stores, they wanted to be able to offer their customer another category that they felt like would be popular.”",

The company maintains the age-verification technology means that the transactions are as secure, or more secure, than online sales, which may not require the purchaser to submit proof of age, or at retail stores, where there is a risk of shoplifting. \"I'm very thankful for those who are taking the time to get to know us and not just making assumptions about what we're about,\" CEO Grant Magers said. \"We are very pro-Second Amendment, but we are for responsible gun ownership, and we hope we're improving the environment for the community.\" There have been 15 mass killings involving a firearm so far in 2024, compared to 39 in 2023, according to a database maintained in a partnership of The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. \"Innovations that make ammunition sales more secure via facial recognition, age verification, and the tracking of serial sales are promising safety measures that belong in gun stores, not in the place where you buy your kids milk,\" said Nick Suplina, senior vice president for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety. \"In a country awash in guns and ammo, where guns are the leading cause of deaths for kids, we don't need to further normalize the sale and promotion of these products.\" Magers said grocery stores and others approached the Texas-based company, which began in 2023, about the idea of selling ammunition through automated technology. The company has one machine in Alabama, four in Oklahoma and one in Texas, with plans for another in Texas and one in Colorado in the coming weeks, he said. \"People I think got shocked when they thought about the idea of selling ammo at a grocery store,\" Magers said. \"But as we explained, how is that any different than Walmart?\" Federal law requires a person to be 18 to buy shotgun and rifle ammunition and 21 to buy handgun ammunition. Magers said their machines require a purchaser to be at least 21. The machine works by requiring a customer to scan their driver's license to validate that they are age 21 or older. The scan also checks that it is a valid license, he said. That is followed by a facial recognition scan to verify \"you are who you are saying you are as a consumer,\" he said. \"At that point you can complete your transaction of your product and you're off and going,\" he said. \"The whole experience takes a minute and a half once you are familiar with the machine.\" The vending machine is another method of sale, joining retail stores and online retailers. A March report by Everytown for Gun Safety found that several major online ammunition retailers did not appear to verify their customers' ages, despite requirements. Last year, an online retailer settled a lawsuit brought by families of those killed and injured in a 2018 Texas high school shooting. The families said the 17-year-old shooter was able to buy ammunition from the retailer who failed to verify his age. Vending machines for bullets or other age-restricted materials is not an entirely new idea. Companies have developed similar technology to sell alcoholic beverages. A company has marketed automated kiosks to sell cannabis products in dispensaries in states where marijuana is legal. A Pennsylvania police officer created a company about 12 years ago that places bullet-vending machines in private gun clubs and ranges as a convenience for patrons. Those machines do not have the age verification mechanism but are only placed in locations with an age requirement to enter, Master Ammo owner Sam Piccinini said. Piccinini spoke with a company years ago about incorporating the artificial intelligence technology to verify a purchaser's age and identity, but at the time it was cost-prohibitive, he said. For American Rounds, one machine had to be removed from a site in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, because of disappointing sales, Magers said. Magers said much of the early interest for the machines has been in rural communities where there may be few retailers that sell ammunition. The American Rounds machines are in Super C Mart and Fresh Value grocery stores in small cities, including Pell City, Alabama, which has a population over 13,600, and Noble, Oklahoma, where nearly 7,600 people live. \"Someone in that community might have to drive an hour or an hour and a half to get supplied if they want to go hunting, for instance,\" Margers said. \"Our grocery stores, they wanted to be able to offer their customer another category that they felt like would be popular.\" ALSO READ | Man charged with concealing corpse after woman's remains found in sleeping bag ---------- * Get Eyewitness News Delivered * More Manhattan news * Send us a news tip * Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts * Follow us on YouTube Submit a tip or story idea to Eyewitness News Have a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

                    "text": "A Moscow court on Tuesday ordered the arrest of the widow of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny on charges of extremism. Yulia Navalnaya, who has lived abroad in self-exile since 2021, was accused of “participating in an extremist community” and placed on an international wanted list, according to The New York Times. “Vladimir Putin is a murderer and a war criminal,” Navalnaya tweeted in response to news of the arrest order. “His place is in prison, and not somewhere in The Hague, in a cozy cell with a TV, but in Russia—in the same colony and the same two-by-three-meter cell in which he killed Alexei.” An explicit reason for Navalnaya’s charges was not shared in a press release from the Basmanny District Court, which issued the arrest order. But Leonid Volkov, Navalny’s former chief of staff, pointed to Navalnaya’s work with the Anti-Corruption Federation in a post on X. Founded by Navalny in 2011 with the goal of exposing Russian government corruption, the nonprofit was branded an “extremist organization” by Moscow a decade later. Navalnaya sits on its advisory board. Volkov added that the order was “quite a recognition of Yulia’s determination to continue Alexei’s fight.” Navalny, long Putin’s fiercest critic, died in a remote Arctic penal colony in February after months of reported psychological and physical abuse. He was arrested after flying into Russia with Navalnaya in 2021—a defiant return that followed his near-fatal poisoning with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok the previous year. Collared on criminally charges that were internationally condemned as trumped-up, Navalny was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. His sentence was later extended by 19 years. Navalny’s collapse and subsequent death sparked an international furor and a fresh round of sanctions against Russia. But Navalnaya cautioned European leaders soon after that economic penalties would not be enough. “If you really want to defeat Putin, you have to become an innovator,” she said in a speech to European Parliament in Strasbourg, France in late February. “You have to stop being boring. You cannot hurt Putin with another resolution or another set of sanctions that is no different from the previous ones.” She and her two children did not attend Navalny’s funeral in Russia over fears they could be arrested. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in his death, but Navalnaya and her allies have repeatedly accused Putin of orchestrating his calculated murder. Navalnaya has vowed to continue her husband’s fight, promising the European Parliament she would do her best “to make his dream come true.” She was elected the new chair of the Human Rights Foundation earlier this month, and has been at work on his posthumous memoir, due out in October.",

                    "text": "July 10 (UPI) -- A Moscow court issued an arrest warrant against Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The Basmanny District Court of Moscow approved the petition by the Main Investigative Directorate to issue the arrest warrant for Navalnaya for \"participation in an extremist community,\" said Moscow's Court of General Jurisdiction in a translated message on Telegram. \"The court granted the investigation's request and chose a preventive measure in the form of detention for a period of two months,\" the court said, noting that Navalnaya was not on a wanted list. \"The period is calculated from the month of extradition to the territory of the Russian Federation or from the moment of detention on the territory of the Russian Federation.\" The charges brought in absentia against Navalnaya, who lives outside of Russia, mean she would be arrested if she returned to the country. Navalnaya bristled at the news of the Moscow arrest warrant, targeting her criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"When you write about this, please do not forget to write the main thing: Vladimir Putin is a murderer and a war criminal,\" Navalnaya said on X. \"His place is in a prison, and not somewhere in The Hague, in a cozy cell with a TV, but in Russia -- in the same colony and same 2-by-3-meter cell in which he killed Alexei.\" Navalny, one of Putin's harshest and most prominent critics died while serving a 19-year sentence on extremism charges in a Russian penal colony in February, with international leaders including U.S. President Joe Biden blaming Putin for his death. Navalnaya charged that her husband had been tortured and starved before he died, but Russian officials said he died of natural causes. Russian officials designated several organizations run by Navalny, including his Anti-Corruption Foundation, as \"extremist\" groups.

                    "text": "Russia on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant for Yulia Navalnaya, accusing the exiled opposition figure of participating in an \"extremist organisation\". A court said it had \"approved the request of the investigators and decided a preventive measure in the form of detention for two months\". Navalnaya has vowed to continue the work of her husband Alexei Navalny, Russian leader Vladimir Putin's main opponent who died in an Arctic prison in February. Navalnaya slammed the warrant in a statement, saying : \"Vladimir Putin is a killer and a war criminal. He belongs in prison\". The activist's team also dismissed the allegations. Navalnaya \"was arrested (in absentia!) for 'being a member of an extremist community' by the infamous Basmanny court of Moscow,\" wrote Leonid Volkov, Navalny's former chief of staff, on X. \"Quite a recognition of Yulia's determination to continue Alexei's fight!\" he added. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday also criticized Russia's move, calling the arrest order a \"warrant against the desire for freedom and democracy\" in a post on X. Navalny's organizations have been outlawed in Russia, labelled an \"extremist\" group and put on an official \"terrorist\" list. Navalnaya, an economist, stood by her husband as he galvanised mass protests in Russia, flying him out of the country when he was poisoned before defiantly returning to Moscow with him in 2021, knowing he would be jailed. Following his death, Navalnaya vowed to take up her late husband's work and has lobbied against Putin's government from abroad. During Russian elections in March, Navalnaya called for mass protests against Putin by forming long queues outside voting stations. (AFP)",

                    "text": "Sharon Stone is looking back on her 2001 stroke with mixed feelings. In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter published Tuesday, the “Basic Instinct” actress revealed she lost $18 million in savings after suffering from the stroke, which caused a nine-day brain bleed, due to “people taking advantage” of her during her seven-year recovery as she stepped away from Hollywood. “I had $18 million saved because of all my success, but when I got back into my bank account, it was all gone. My refrigerator, my phone — everything was in other people’s names,” Stone said. “I had zero money.” The actress, 66, went on to reveal that the trauma of her injury “100 percent” changed the way her brain functions and the way she thinks. “A Buddhist monk told me that I had been reincarnated into my same body,” Stone said. “I had a death experience and then they brought me back. I bled into my brain for nine days, so my brain was shoved to the front of my face. It wasn’t positioned in my head where it was before,” the actress continued. “And while that was happening, everything changed,” Stone recalled. “My sense of smell, my sight, my touch. I couldn’t read for a couple of years.” “Things were stretched and I was seeing color patterns. A lot of people thought I was going to die.” Now that she’s healed, the “Casino” star said she was able to move on after losing her money because she decided to “stay present and let go.” “I decided not to hang onto being sick or to any bitterness or anger. If you bite into the seed of bitterness, it never leaves you. But if you hold faith, even if that faith is the size of a mustard seed, you will survive,” Stone said. “So, I live for joy now. I live for purpose.”",

While the film received poor ratings from critics, it implied that Stone isn't ready to take her final bow just yet.Like Stone, it's not uncommon for older Americans to continue working even as they age.This is especially so if they've been scammed out of their retirement savings or simply just don't have enough money to support themselves when they stop earning a paycheck.A 2024 survey of 4,588 adults found that US Gen Xers think they need about $1.56 million to retire comfortably.

                    "text": "Sharon Stone had “zero money” to her name after she suffered a stroke in 2001. The “Basic Instinct” actress, 66, opened up about how her finances took a hit following the health crisis that required seven years of recovery in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published Tuesday. “People took advantage of me over that time,” Stone said. “I had $18 million saved because of all my success, but when I got back into my bank account, it was all gone. My refrigerator, my phone — everything was in other people’s names.” “I had zero money,” she added. Stone suffered a nine-day brain bleed, which resulted in a 1 percent chance of survival. She claimed last year that doctors thought she was “faking it” and nearly sent her home before reevaluating her and sending her into brain surgery. The whole ordeal forced the Oscar nominee to step away from acting for two years. Despite the hardship, Stone said that she wasn’t bitter about what happened to her. “I decided to stay present and let go,” she explained to THR. “I decided not to hang onto being sick or to any bitterness or anger. If you bite into the seed of bitterness, it never leaves you. But if you hold faith, even if that faith is the size of a mustard seed, you will survive.” “So, I live for joy now,” Stone added. “I live for purpose.” The “Casino” actress also said that the stroke changed her forever. “A Buddhist monk told me that I had been reincarnated into my same body.

Things were stretched and I was seeing color patterns. A lot of people thought I was going to die.” But Stone noted that “the good part” of her stroke was that she got divorced from her second husband, news editor Phil Bronstein, during that time. “That was the upside,” she said. In 2019, Stone told Variety that she “lost everything she had” after the stroke. “I lost my place in the business. I was like the hottest movie star, you know? It was like Miss Princess Diana and I were so famous — and she died and I had a stroke. And we were forgotten,” she explained. “You find yourself at the back of the line in your business, as I did. You have to figure yourself out all over again,” she added. Last year, Stone said her career hasn’t been the same because of the brain hemorrhage. “I recovered for seven years, and I haven’t had jobs since,” she said at The Hollywood Reporter’s Raising Our Voices event. “When it first happened, I didn’t want to tell anybody because you know if something goes wrong with you, you’re out. Something went wrong with me — I’ve been out for 20 years.” Stone stressed that she was “a very big movie star at one point in my life,” but now she has a harder time finding work.",

                    "text": "It's time, terrible pun intended, for a Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 vs. Apple Watch Series 9 face-off. At Unpacked on July 10, the Korean tech giant unveiled the next-generation Galaxy Watch. But the question is, how does it differ from its Apple-made counterpart? Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 vs. Apple Watch Series 9: Price The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 starts at $299 and preorders launch on July 10. The Apple Watch Series 9, on the other hand, starts at $399. (But you can find cheaper Watch Series 9 models on Amazon.) Whether you get the Galaxy Watch 7 or Watch Series 9, depending on the band style and size you choose, the price tag may increase. In addition, Apple has a choice between \"GPS only\" and \"GPS + Cellular.\" Cellular support adds an extra $100 to the price tag. The Galaxy Watch 7, no matter which model you get, comes with cellular support. Winner: Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 vs. Apple Watch Series 9: Design The new Galaxy smartwatch continues to sport a circular design while its Apple rival features a squircle form factor. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 comes in two sizes: large (44mm) and small (40mm). You can choose from three color options: Green, Silver, and Cream. Plus, all size options come with the following band styles: Sport, Fabric, and Athleisure. Apple, on the other hand, sells the Watch Series 9 in two finishes: aluminum case (matte finish) and stainless steel case (polished finish). Similar to the Galaxy Watch 7, it comes in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. You can choose from five colorways: Pink, Midnight, Starlight, Silver, and (Product) RED. You can also choose between three band styles: Rubber (flexible and swimproof), Textile (soft, fabric-like material), Stainless Steel (sophisticated and upscale). And under those categories, you can further narrow your preferences. For example, under Rubber, you can grab a Nike Sports Band. But under Textile, you can grab a Braided Solo Loop. As such, Apple provides far more options as far as band style is concerned. I'd caution against \"Solo Loop\" under Rubber; it loosens over time. Textiles may be attractive, but they're harder to clean compared to the other styles. Winner: Apple Watch Series 9 Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 vs. Apple Watch Series 9: Health tracking The Apple Watch Series 9 comes with the following health-tracking features: Skin temperature monitoring (available on Galaxy Watch 7)Cycle tracking (available on Galaxy Watch 7)Irregular rhythm notifications (available on Galaxy Watch 7)High or low heart rate notifications (available on Galaxy Watch 7)ECG testing (available on Galaxy Watch 7)Sleep tracking (available on Galaxy Watch 7) If you purchase an Apple Watch Series 9 in the U.S., it will not come with a blood-oxygen sensor. (The Apple Watch Series 9 used to come with a blood-oxygen sensor, but due to a recent ruling, the Cupertino-based tech giant can no longer sell smartwatches with this feature.) The Galaxy Watch 7, on the other hand, does monitor blood-oxygen levels. The Galaxy Watch 7, using bioeletrical impedance analysis (BIA) tech, can also track your body composition based on your weight, body fat, body mass index (BMI), skeletal muscle, body water, and basal metabolic rate (BMR), The Watch Series 9 doesn't appear to have this feature natively built into the device. Finally, the Galaxy Watch 7 has a blood-pressure monitor and a sleep apnea sensor; the Apple Watch Series 9 does not. Winner: Galaxy Watch 7 Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 vs. Apple Watch Series 9: Which should you buy? Both operate best in their own ecosystem. The Galaxy Watch 7 works best with, you guessed it, Samsung devices. In fact, some Galaxy Watch 7 features, powered by Galaxy AI, are only available to Samsung phone owners. As for the Watch Series 9, you can only snag it if you have an iPhone. So which is better? It depends. If tracking blood-oxygen levels, sleep apnea, blood pressure are important to you, opt for the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7; the Apple Watch Series 9 doesn't have those features. (However, the Apple Watch X, expected to drop later this year, is rumored to get a blood-pressure sensor.)",

                    "text": "Ever wanted a powerful, rugged wearable like the Apple Watch Ultra, but more — well — Samsung? The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is the company's first premium-tier, rugged smartwatch, and thus a natural competitor with Apple's most powerful wearable. It's even called Ultra, so there's no mistake in what Samsung's aiming for here. Now that the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is official, we can compare the two watches, side-by-side. And yes, there are a couple of ways in which Samsung's wearable wins big. Let's dig in. Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2: Price and specs Apple Watch Ultra 2 costs $799, while the Samsung Watch Ultra will cost $649.99 when it becomes available for pre-order on July 10. Yes, it's quite a big difference, and you could spend that $150 surplus towards accessories such as additional bands for the Samsung smartwatch. It's difficult to compare smartwatches spec-for-spec, as specs typically don't tell the whole story. You need to actually use the watch to see how it performs. That said, Samsung put some powerful hardware inside the Galaxy Watch Ultra, including a 3nm processor (a first for a Galaxy Watch), 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, a complex,13 LED sensor system that tracks your heart rate and other biometric data, and a dual GPS system. The display is a 47mm AMOLED with a 480 x 480-pixel resolution. Apple Watch Ultra runs on Apple's S9 chip, 64GB of storage memory, and also has a ton of sensors, including an electrical heart sensor, an optical heart sensor, and a temperature sensor. Its Retina OLED display is a bit larger at 49mm, with a 502 x 410-pixel resolution. Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2: Design Before we saw the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, we thought this would be a very simple choice: rectangular (Apple) vs. circular (Samsung). But to our surprise, Samsung upped the ante by making the Galaxy Watch Ultra's case rectangular-esque while keeping the watch face circular. The result is a pretty sweet looking watch that clearly differentiates itself from \"regular\" Samsung smartwatches. It's a best of both worlds, in a way, and we think it's a win. Size and weight are similar between the two devices. Apple Watch Ultra measures 49x44mm and weighs 61.4 grams, while Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra measures 47.1 x 47.4mm and weighs a little less at 60.5 grams. In terms of ruggedness, an important selling point for this type of device, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra has a titanium case, is water and dust resistant up to IP68 specifications while also being resistant to MIL-STD 810H military standard. Plus, it can withstand temperatures as low as -4F and as high as 131F. In comparison, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 also has a titanium case, and it has also been tested up to MIL-ST 810H standard and has IP6X dust resistance. Additionally, Apple says you can take it for recreational scuba diving up to 40 meters of depth. Another tidbit that shows that Samsung was most definitely inspired by Apple Watch Ultra is the addition of the Quick Button, a customizable side button that lets you easily start, pause, or stop your workouts and more. Finally, the colors. While the Apple Watch is only available in a titanium finish, Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra comes in three colors: Titanium Gray, Titanium White, and Titanium Silver, which is a mix of silver and black. Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2: Health & fitness tracking Beyond merely measuring your heart rate and tracking your sleep, Samsung's Galaxy Watch Ultra also keeps track of your Energy Score, as well as offer Wellness Tips based on your sleep and workout data. The company also boasts an enhanced AI sleep algorithm, which reportedly provides more accurate sleep analysis. And thanks to the all-new sleep apnea sensor, the Galaxy Watch can detect if you're having serious breathing issues while you're trying to get restful sleep. When it comes to fitness tracking, Samsung's new watch offers Heart Rate Zones, allowing you to keep precise track of whether your workout has crossed that anaerobic threshold. The Race feature lets you compete against yourself. Cyclers will appreciate the new Functional Threshold Power Test, which helps you figure out your max power on the bike. Apple Watch Ultra offers similar functionality, and has quite a few additional features for divers, though you need to purchase the dive app separately from Apple's App Store. Apple Watch Ultra also has a lot of features related to cardiac health, including irregular rhythm notifications, as well as high an low heart rate notifications. Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2: Battery life This is a big one. Apple Watch Ultra reigns supreme among Apple watches, with a 36-hour battery life in normal use and up to 72 hours of battery life in low power mode. Samsung's Galaxy Watch Ultra, however, offers up to 60 hours of battery life in daily use (up to 100 hours if you've turned on power saving mode) — and up to 16 hours of battery life when tracking workouts with GPS on, which goes up to 48 hours if you turn on the exercise power saving mode. We need to test this for ourselves before passing final judgment, but Samsung's watch is a winner in this regard, at least on paper. Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2: Which one should you buy? The jury is still out on this one as we haven't had time for a proper review of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra just yet (it's coming, though). And comparisons between Apple and non-Apple smartwatches are always difficult, as it makes almost no sense to have an Apple Watch and an Android phone, or an iPhone with a Samsung smartwatch. For now, though, we'll say that someone rocking a Samsung (or another Android) phone has a decent option to pair it with a premium Samsung smartwatch.",

The Galaxy Watch Ultra is clearly a rival to the rugged Apple Watch Ultra, putting a round screen into a large 47mm case. That watch arrives alongside a new standard Galaxy Watch 7, which will come in smaller 40mm and 44mm designs. While some of Samsung's devices are getting price increases for their base model over last year, like the new foldable Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6, the Galaxy Watch 7's price will start at $300, just like last year's Galaxy Watch 6. The Galaxy Watch Ultra will be Samsung's most expensive watch so far, starting at $650. That's still significantly less than Apple's $799 Watch Ultra.",

It's available for preorder through the Samsung store as of July 10 at 9 AM ET for $649.99. Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event has been hotly anticipated. At the beginning of this year, the brand introduced its Galaxy AI systems, and during Unpacked, it expanded its AI reach into wearable tech. But the real star of the show is all the incoming tech including the Z Flip 6, Z Fold 6, Galaxy Ring, and the brand new Galaxy Watch Ultra. Samsung's Galaxy Watch Ultra is the brand's latest entry in wearable tech, calling it its \"toughest watch ever.\" The Ultra is built for tough conditions — building off its circular watch face, it's covered in a layer of aerospace-grade titanium. It can survive depths of water up to 100 meters (the same as the Apple Watch Ultra) and elevations ranging between 330 feet below sea level and 29.5K feet above sea level. Plus it withstands temperatures from -4 to 131 degrees Fahrenheit. All of this comes with superior battery life, running for 48 hours in exercise power-saving mode and 100 hours with daily activities. In addition to its durable design, the watch is there to offer deeper health insights. With the new Galaxy AI Health system, it offers an Energy Score, a metric calculated through seven different health factors including sleep, activity, and heart rate. Once you get your Energy Score, you can make improvements with Samsung's Wellness Tips which are personalized recommendations for a better, healthier life. Noise and motion cancellation are loaded into the watch for more accurate activity measurements. With all your movement data, the watch allows you to race yourself, using prior data when running or biking on daily routes. Plus, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra monitors sleep and is FDA-approved to detect symptoms of sleep apnea — data you can use and act on. It comes in three different colors: titanium grey, titanium white, and titanium silver. There are a variety of bands to choose from; the marine band is quick-drying and secure, the trail brand is breathable and lightweight, and the PeakForm band is sporty but stylish.

                    "text": "The second Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event of 2024 has been and gone, leaving in its wake a whole suite of new Galaxy devices. These range for the usual suspects in the shape of two new foldable phones to Samsung's first smart ring, and its retort to the Apple Watch Ultra. Across its keynote, Samsung touted smart, consumer-focused AI tools for its new devices, with the aim of helping you to get more done, embrace your creative side, stay healthier, and sleep better. You can check our our Samsung Galaxy Unpacked July live blog for a beat-by-beat account of what was announced, and more reaction and analysis, but read on to learn about nine of the biggest announcements from Galaxy Unpacked. 1. A new Galaxy Ring to rule them all The Samsung Galaxy Ring is Samsung’s first foray into a new wearables category, a minimalist set-and-forget tracker that's designed to be worn 24/7. With up to seven days of battery, the Ring contains several sensors for the sort of passive wellness tracking found in the watch, monitoring heart rate, skin temperature, estimating steps taken, and automatically logging running and walking workouts. It feeds that information directly into the Samsung Health app, giving you a Sleep Score and Energy Score along with AI-powered personalized tips. It’s a slender, sophisticated fitness tracker that signals a new era for wearables. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar Read more: check out our hands-on Samsung Galaxy Ring review 2. But choose wisely... That's because the Galaxy Ring's sizes are based US standard sizes, with nine different options from US size 5 to size 13. And Samsung says that the availability of the Ring's size and colors will vary by region. To find the right size for you, you'll need to use a free Sizing Kit when you place an order for the Ring. However, the smaller the Galaxy Ring, the smaller the battery life. So if you have super-slim fingers your Galaxy Ring will last an estimated six days instead of seven. Read more: Samsung Galaxy Ring sizes confirmed – and battery life varies depending on which one you pick 3. A smarter, sleeker flagship foldable phone You'd be forgiven for thinking the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 looks pretty much identical to its predecessor. But look more closely and you'll see it's a little shorter and wider, making for a cover display that's more usable in one hand. Plus, under the hood you'll find the a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip tuned for Samsung. That's handy as the Galaxy Z Fold 6 will need that slice of silicon to power the baked-in Galaxy AI features, including a neat Sketch to Image feature that takes S Pen doodles on a photo and uses AI to turn them into images of real-world objects – say taking the sketched outline of some glasses on the image of a dog and having the AI generate a real-looking set of specs to cover the pooch's eyes. Another smart AI feature is how the Interpreter app can work across the Fold 6's displays by providing a conversation mode that shows two-way translations of the main and cover displays. Basically, the Galaxy Fold 6 is the smartest folding phone you can preorder right now. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar Read more: check out our hands-on Samsung Galaxy Fold 6 review 4. Apple Watch Ultra who? Meet the Galaxy Watch Ultra The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra takes the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 and supercharges it for outdoor pursuits. The Ultra offers a more impressive battery, a titanium-armored “cushion” redesign, a programmable “Quick” button, improved GPS and new tools for wilderness survivability. It’s obviously taking a lot of inspiration from the Apple Watch Ultra, but it’s great to see a real boost in performance for Samsung Galaxy Watches and from our brief hands-on time, it looks set to be a dependable companion for the office and the outdoors alike. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar Read more: check out our hands-on Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra review 5. A smarter, snapper Galaxy Z Flip with a serious camera The Galaxy Z Fold 6 may have received top billing at Samsung’s latest Galaxy Unpacked event, but the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is definitely the more fun of the two new best foldable phone contenders (after all, who doesn’t love a modern-day flip phone?). This year’s Galaxy Z Flip model delivers plenty of iterative upgrades over the Galaxy Z Flip 5 – not least a new 50MP camera, a faster Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, a bigger batter and improved durability – and it also plays host to a handful of new software and AI features. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is available to pre-order now in four color options: Yellow, Blue, Mint and Silver Shadow. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar Read more: check out our hands-on Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 review 6. AI in your ears – thanks to the Galaxy Buds Pro 3 The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have taken an AirPods-like new direction, with sticks extending downwards from the buds, with new pinch-and-swipe controls – plus a cool 'Blade Light' on the Pro model. More importantly, they have big sound upgrades, including an advanced dual-driver system in the Pro, and upgraded noise cancellation. That ANC is AI-powered, with smart adaptive skills – though it'll be better in the more expensive Pro option, of course. They also promise AI improvement to call quality, and longer battery life, as well as 24-bit Hi-Res Audio and 3D spatial sound when used with the best Samsung phones. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar Read more: the Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro rock an AirPods-like design, and some actually interesting AI features 7. A Galaxy Watch to watch Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 7 doesn’t stray from the circular design of its predecessors, like the Galaxy Watch 6, but instead makes meaningful changes under the hood. Inside, it’s powered by a 3-nanometer Samsung Exynos chip, and on the rear, it boasts a completely redesigned BioActive Sensor. Those two pieces of hardware power an Energy Score feature that aims to make your health data more digestible and strives for any metric to be more accurate. The Watch 7 also gets gesture controls through a pinch and Galaxy AI features like smarter suggested replies. Unlike the Fold or Flip, there isn’t a price increase either. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar Read more: check out our hands-on Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 review 8. A new 'XR' platform is coming, with a little help from Google In an almost blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment at Unpacked, Google reaffirmed its XR platform plans (a catchall for VR, AR, and MR), in partnership with Samsung, with Samsung President and Head of the Mobile Experience (MX) business TM Roh saying that the fruits of Samsung and Google’s XR partnership are coming “this year.” Our best guess for when we’ll hear more is at Samsung Developer’s Conference (SDC) which is scheduled for October 3, 2024. But considering we’re halfway through 2024, Samsung and Google had better get a move on. Read more: Samsung confirms ‘new XR platform coming this year’ in partnership with Google 9. Get your Energy Score... with a catch At Unpacked, Samsung revealed a new Energy Score feature for Galaxy Watches that monitors you and gives you a form of battery charge rating for your body; basically, it'll flag when you're running yourself into the ground, which is very much a symptom of modern life. Samsung touted the feature as a way to enhance \"your awareness of the ways your health influences your daily life, so you can utilize recommendations based on your current physical state to focus your daily efforts on making improvements\". But there's a catch. The small print noites you'll need a Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 or newer to be able to get an Energy Score. The Watch 4 was released in 2021, so if you have anything older, like a Samsung Galaxy Watch 3, you won't get get a charge rating for your body; you'll have to rely on the old fashioned way of telling how tired you are by seeing if you can get off the sofa after rolling in from work.

Bachelor in Paradise — the summer spinoff series that launched in 2014 as an offshoot to The Bachelor and The Bachelorette — will return with season 10, ABC has announced. The milestone season will hit screens in 2025. A premiere date has yet to be announced. Bachelor in Paradise welcomes breakout fan favorites from The Bachelor franchise to the show’s resort in Mexico for a second (or third) chance at finding love. The cast will be announced closer to premiere. The renewal news follows Monday night’s launch of season 21 of The Bachelorette with Jenn Tran. The contestant from Joey Graziadei’s recent season of The Bachelor is the long-running franchise’s first Asian American lead. This fall will also air the inaugural season The Golden Bachelorette, on Sept. 18, with Joan Vassos, a contestant from Gerry Turner’s Golden Bachelor season that launched the senior spinoff series. Bachelor in Paradise‘s longtime bartender Wells Adams had previously mused about how a Golden Bachelor in Paradise could look, once at least two seasons have been released. “Everyone’s very, very happy about the success of The Golden Bachelor. It makes sense that the next thing would be Golden Bachelorette and, ipso sexo, a Golden Bachelor in Paradise,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “It needs to happen in Florida at Del Boca Vista [from Seinfeld]. Everyone needs to drive around in golf carts, dates at shuffleboard courts. I need to be making drinks but also have Mylanta on the side.” Bachelor in Paradise is a production of Warner Bros. Unscripted Television in association with Warner Horizon.",

Season 10 will likely pull its beach-goers from both Joey Graziadei’s season of “The Bachelor,” which premiered in January 2024, as well as Jenn Tran’s season of “The Bachelorette,” which recently premiered on July 8. With just a year gap in between Season 8’s debut in September 2022 and Season 9’s premiere in September 2023, “Bachelor in Paradise” took a pause this year as the franchise focused on debuting its “Golden” iterations, which had been in the works for years. The inaugural season of “The Golden Bachelor,” which was led by 71-year-old Gerry Turner, debuted alongside “Bachelor in Paradise” Season 9 in September 2023 and immediately captured the hearts of “Bachelor” nation and beyond. By February 2024, ABC announced the official green light for “The Golden Bachelorette,” which will be led by “Golden Bachelor” alum Joan Vassos. Vassos’ season of “The Golden Bachelorette” debuts Wednesday, Sept. 18 at 8 p.m. ET. Beginning Oct. 9, “The Golden Bachelorette” will air from 8 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. ET before new episodes of “Abbott Elementary” Season 4. “Bachelor in Paradise” is produced by Warner Bros. Unscripted Television in association with Warner Horizon.",

Barron, 18, turned and waved to the crowd of Trump supporters at his father’s Doral golf course as the former president praised him for his smarts, demeanor and rising popularity. “This is a young man. He just turned 18 – Oh, look at this,” the 78-year-old former president said, stopping as the crowd’s cheers intensified. “A very young man who is now going to college – got into every college he wanted to and he made his choice,” Trump continued. “He’s a very good guy.” “This is the first time he’s ever done this, Barron … stand up,” Trump said as his teenage son rose up and gave the crowd another fist pump and wave. “That’s the first time he’s done it. That’s the first time, right? You’re pretty popular. He might be more popular than Don and Eric, we got to talk about that,” the former president said, referencing his other two sons – both of whom addressed the crowd prior to their father’s arrival. “Welcome to the scene, Barron,” the ex-commander in chief said, before remarking that Barron “had such a nice, easy life – now it’s a little bit changed.” Barron was recently seen riding in a golf cart with his father in a leaked video showing the former president slamming President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in the days after the June 27 debate. In May, the 18-year-old was asked to be a Florida delegate at the Republican National Convention, but he declined the request. Barron, who at 6-foot-7 inches tall towers above his father, has largely stayed out of the political fray. The Trump family has not announced which college Barron will attend in the fall.",

                    "text": "Barron Trump received rapturous cheers and applause as he attended his father's Florida rally amid Donald Trump's ongoing efforts to land a second presidential term.The youngest of the former president's children, and his only child with wife Melania Trump, the 18-year-old was given a moment in the spotlight as his father introduced him at a campaign event near Miami on Tuesday night.Presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump introduced all three of his sons to the crowd of supporters, before saying that it was \"the first time\" his youngest offspring had ever attended a rally. He also teased his son's future in college.The Republican was seemingly caught off guard by the crowd rising to give a standing ovation when he began to introduce his youngest son, saying, \"Oh, look at this!\"\"A very young man who's now going to college,\" Donald Trump said while continuing the introduction. \"Got into every college he wanted to and he made his choice. And he's a very good guy, I'll tell you…He's a very special guy, Barron Trump. This is the first time he's ever done this.\"Donald Trump then asked the teen to stand up, as he told the crowd: \"Look at him!\" The recent high school graduate obliged, briefly waving to the crowd and pumping his fist before his father said he is \"pretty popular\" and \"might be more popular\" than older sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump.\"Barron, it's good to have you,\" Donald Trump said. \"Welcome to the scene, Barron. I don't know. He had such a nice easy life, now it's a little bit changed.\"Newsweek has contacted a representative of Donald Trump via email for comment.Footage of Barron Trump's moment in the spotlight was shared on X, formerly Twitter, by Bo Loudon, a rising political influencer whose parents are conservative commentator Gina Loudon and former Missouri state senator John William Loudon. Gina Loudon was on the 2020 Trump campaign's media advisory board.\"MY FRIEND BARRON TRUMP JUST GOT A STANDING OVATION FROM 45,000 PEOPLE IN DORAL, FLORIDA!\" Bo Loudon, 17, captioned the 10-second-long clip. \"Congratulations, happy for you bro! Share to make this go viral!\"As of press time, the video had garnered more than 400,000 views.Barron Trump's choice of college remained publicly unknown at the time of publication, although possibilities include New York University, Georgetown University and the University of Pennsylvania.In a September 2023 interview with Megyn Kelly, the former president said that his son was \"thinking about\" attending his father's alma mater, The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.During an appearance on Fox News' Fox & Friends Weekend in June, Trump suggested that Barron's college search had been altered because of \"rioting\" during a wave of pro-Palestinian protests at campuses across the nation.\"Six months ago you look at a college, and you sort of want a certain college,\" Trump said. \"And then you see all of these colleges are rioting and maybe you want to go to a different kind of a college. Because there's plenty of colleges that we also like that are different and they don't riot.\"Barron Trump has kept a relatively low profile, mainly appearing silently by his family's side at campaign events. That changed in May, when it was announced that the teen, who had graduated from high school that month, would be a Florida delegate at this month's upcoming Republican National Convention.It was shared in the announcement that he would be joining his half-siblings Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Tiffany Trump at the event.However, just a day later his mother shot down the prospects of him being a delegate, saying via a spokesperson: \"While Barron is honored to have been chosen as a delegate by the Florida Republican Party, he regretfully declines to participate due to prior commitments.\"In a rare public appearance alongside Donald Trump earlier this month, Barron sat on a golf cart next to his father as the ex-president denounced President Joe Biden as an \"old broken down pile of crap\" and Vice President Kamala Harris as \"so f****** bad.\"",

                    "text": "The youngest son of former President Donald Trump made his debut on the campaign trail. Barron Trump appeared at his father's rally in Doral, Florida, on Tuesday night, where he stood for a sustained applause amid praise from Donald. \"That’s the first time he’s done it. That’s the first time, right?\" Trump said as Barron accepted applause. \"You’re pretty popular, he might be more popular than Don and Eric, we gotta talk about this. Hey Don, we gotta talk about this.\" TRUMP TELLS GOP TO 'PASS THE SAVE ACT' OR 'GO HOME AND CRY YOURSELF TO SLEEP' \"So Barron, it’s good to have you. Welcome to the scene, Barron,\" Trump continued. \"He had such a nice, easy life. Now it's a little bit changed.\" The former president clarified that Barron is set to go to college in the coming semester and has \"made his choice\" on school, but did not clarify where he would be attending. Trump has previously praised his 18-year-old son as a \"smart one,\" adding that the former first son likes to give his dad political advice. TRUMP SAYS SON BARRON, 18, LIKES POLITICS AND GIVES HIM ADVICE: 'HE'S A SMART ONE' \"He’s seen it, he doesn’t have to hear it,\" the 2024 presumptive Republican nominee previously told Philadelphia’s Talk Radio 1210 WPHT after the host asked if he had advised Barron on \"how nasty\" politics can be. \"He’s a smart one,\" Trump continued. \"He doesn’t have to hear much, but he’s a great guy. He’s a little on the tall side. I will tell you, he’s a tall one. But he’s a good-looking guy, and he’s really been a great student and he does like politics.\" At one point, the teenager was set to take an active part in Republician Party politics as a delegate for his father. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Republican Party of Florida chairman Evan Power said in May that Barron would serve as one of 41 at-large delegates from Florida to the national gathering, where the GOP is set to officially nominate his father as its presidential candidate for the November general election. However, this plan proved premature after Barron's mother — Melania Trump — shut down such plans that same month. \"While Barron is honored to have been chosen as a delegate by the Florida Republican Party, he regretfully declines to participate due to prior commitments,\" Melania Trump's office said in a statement following the announcement.

                    "text": "The 18-year-old son of former President Donald Trump made his debut at one of his father’s campaign rallies, appearing at an event in Florida on Tuesday evening. “This is the first time he’s ever done it,” former President Trump of his son, Barron Trump, at the Tuesday event in Doral to a lengthy applause as his son stood up and waved. ”You’re pretty popular, he might be more popular than Don and Eric,” he said, referring to his older two sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. “So Barron, it’s good to have you. Welcome to the scene, Barron,” the former president said. “He had such a nice, easy life. Now it’s a little bit changed.” The younger Trump did not make any public comments at the rally, instead only waving, giving a thumbs-up sign to the other rally attendees, and pumping his fist. The former president’s two other aforementioned sons as well as his daughter, Ivanka Trump, have been involved in politics since their father’s first campaign, appearing at a number of events and rallies over the years. Notably, Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, served in the Trump administration as advisors but aren’t currently involved in his 2024 reelection campaign. His other daughter, Tiffany, has made few public appearances with her father, although she spoke in favor of him at the 2016 Republican National Convention. Barron, who was a child throughout the Trump administration, has largely remained out of the spotlight since his father entered the political arena. However, former First Lady Melania Trump, Barron’s mother, issued a statement soon after that he wouldn’t attend. “While Barron is honored to have been chosen as a delegate by the Florida Republican Party, he regretfully declines due to prior commitments,” the statement from the former first lady’s office said in a statement in May. Around the same time, former President Trump said in a radio interview that his son sometimes gives him political advice. “He’s a great guy. He’s a little on the tall side, I will tell you. He’s a tall one. But he’s a good-looking guy, and he’s really been a great student and he does like politics. It’s sort of funny, he‘ll tell me sometimes, ’Dad, this is what you have to do,'” he told Philadelphia’s Talk Radio 1210 WPHT in May, adding that Barron will soon “be going to college.” Other than Mr. Rubio, Sens. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.), along with North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, were also mentioned in the interview. “The names that you mentioned, absolutely they’re under consideration,” former President Trump said, suggesting that he will make the announcement “probably a little before the convention, but not much” or “it could even be during the convention.”",

                    "text": "Audrina Patridge and Michael Ray are Instagram official! The Hills alum, 39, and country singer, 36, confirmed their romance in a cute post on Tuesday, July 9. “There’s a lot of things in life worth letting go. But the ones that mean the most, you gotta hold ?,” Patridge wrote in the caption, quoting a lyric from Ray’s new song “Hold” while sharing a photo of her and Ray cuddling up together at night. Ray responded in the comment section, “Let’s go babe!!! Grateful for you and Kirra ❤️♾️,” referring to Patridge and her eight-year-old daughter Kirra, whom she shares with her ex-husband Corey Bohan, as Patridge wrote back, “❤️❤️.” Both Ray and Patridge reshared the post on their Instagram Stories — with Patridge adding a big white outlined heart in the background behind the photo. The pair’s relationship confirmation comes after Patridge posted a photo on her Instagram Stories of her and Ray kissing with her legs wrapped around his waist in late June. “This one…,” she captioned the sweet snapshot at the time, adding a smiley face with hearts emoji. Representatives for Patridge and Ray at the time did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment. Fans previously spotted that Patridge and Ray had liked each other’s posts for the past three months on Instagram, including photos from Stagecoach posted by Patridge in April. The Choices: To the Hills and Back Again author’s new romance with the country singer comes after she dated The Hills costar Justin \"Justin Bobby\" Brescia and musician Ryan Cabrera. Patridge was also married to Bohan from 2016 to 2018, during which time she alleged she experienced domestic abuse. Speaking to PEOPLE about her divorce in July 2022, Patridge said, \"Now, it's like, I love myself enough to walk away. You have to love yourself enough to say enough is enough. Or I'm not putting up with this.” Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \"I've learned a lot of that going through this. And I've learned that when you're in a bad relationship, you put up with a lot of things because you're trying to force it to work ... to make the other person happy. And that's not good. You've got to notice all those signs and stop it before it gets too far.\" Ray, meanwhile, divorced from his ex-wife, fellow country singer Carly Pearce, in June 2020 after eight months of marriage. The “Whiskey and Rain” singer previously told PEOPLE that, despite the difficult split, he was open to getting remarried. \"I think maybe down the road, for sure,” he said in June 2023. “I believe that that's what we're put on this world to do, is to find somebody that you connect with that makes you better and create a family and leave a legacy.”",

The Hills alum and country star first confirmed they were dating in July 2024 after teasing their relationship on Instagram. Both Patridge and Ray have been married previously, with Patridge sharing a daughter, Kirra, with her ex-husband Corey Bohan. Ray and his ex-wife, fellow country singer Carly Pearce, filed for divorce in June 2020 after eight months of marriage. However, the “Whiskey and Rain” singer told PEOPLE three years later, in June 2023, that he was open to finding love and settling down again. “I believe that that's what we're put on this world to do, is to find somebody that you connect with that makes you better and create a family and leave a legacy,” he said on whether he’d marry again in the future. “So for sure, one day.\" From their first tease of each other to going Instagram official, here’s everything to know about Audrina Patridge and Michael Ray’s relationship. Patridge and Ray first fueled dating rumors after Stagecoach in April 2024 The couple were first rumored to be together after Patridge posted photos from Stagecoach in April 2024 and fans were quick to notice Ray liked her carousel of images.

Patridge has previously spoken about her struggles dating as a single parent Patridge has been honest about her priorities while dating as a single parent. She and Bohan split in 2017, leaving her with sole physical custody of their daughter. \"I have my daughter 24/7, so when I do go on a date, I don't want to waste my time because I could be with my daughter,\" Patridge told E! News in July 2022. \"I'm still navigating that, to be honest.\" Ray has been open about seeking therapy following his divorce Ray went through a painful divorce of his own in June 2020 when he split from Pearce. He opened up to PEOPLE in June 2023 about how the stress of the divorce took him down a dark path of depression and anger. Coming from a family with divorced parents, Ray said the feeling that he was following in their footsteps led him to spiral even more. \"I come from a broken family. So a little bit for me was like, 'Am I repeating the process?' \" he said. \"I never understood depression or had depression. All of a sudden, I was getting very angry. I didn't trust anybody.\" After seeking therapy, Ray said he learned to come to terms with his split and deal with what he was going through. \"Two people were involved in something, and two people dropped the ball individually,\" he said. \"However I dropped the ball, I don't want to continue that. I did a lot of introspective work.\" Patridge has said she values communication in a relationship Patridge has also spoken candidly about what she looks for in her relationships following her divorce, including a strong line of communication and knowing when to end it. \"Now, it's like, I love myself enough to walk away,” she told PEOPLE in July 2022. “You have to love yourself enough to say enough is enough. Or I'm not putting up with this.” She continued, “You crossed the line and I'm not okay with it. It's all about communication and setting boundaries and not being pushed into peer pressure, or gaining that strength, courage and security back that you're going to be okay.”",

                    "text": "CBS News president Ingrid Ciprian-Matthews will exit the company, after a year running the broadcast news division. The executive will shift to a role as a senior editorial adviser later this month, helping to oversee coverage of the 2024 presidential election, with plans to exit completely after that. Ciprian-Matthews announced the decision in a note to staff Wednesday, and a source says she immediately went on to lead the 9 a.m. editorial call to discuss the 2024 election. In her note, Ciprian-Matthews indicated that looming cost cutting at Paramount is a big reason for her exit. “Some may be asking why I’m announcing this now,” she wrote. “We all know our industry and company are going through a transformation and a number of short- and long-term decisions need to be made. I do not want to be disingenuous with any of you about who should drive these decisions. I’ve always leaned into my integrity and my values and I felt it was important to be transparent at this juncture about my plans.” Wendy McMahon, who leads the CBS News and Stations group, will likely be the one responsible for figuring out where the division needs to cut back, and where synergies can be found. McMahon gained direct oversight of CBS News and CBS’ syndication business last August, after co-leading the division alongside Neeraj Khamlani. Ciprian-Matthews was elevated to CBS News president at the same time. However, Paramount’s trio of CEOs are set to undergo cost cutting, to the tune of $500 million, despite a deal to sell the company to Skydance. CBS News it appears will not be exempt from those efforts. With the exit of Ciprian-Matthews, no broadcast news division will have its own president. ABC News president Kim Godwin left in May, while NBC News has been operating with a trio of executives reporting to Cesar Conde, who runs the News, Telemundo and stations group at NBCUniversal. You can read Ciprian-Matthews’ note, below. Hello everyone, No journalist wants to ‘be’ the news, especially me. But today, I have some news of my own to share. After much consideration, I’ve decided this is the right time to step away from my current role at CBS News and begin to write my next chapter. George and Wendy understand how difficult a decision this has been. They have supported me through this process and for that I am very grateful. At the end of the month, I’ll be transitioning to a new role. I have gladly agreed to stay on through the election as a senior editorial adviser to CBS News, given the historical significance of this election and the current political moment. Some may be asking why I’m announcing this now. We all know our industry and company are going through a transformation and a number of short- and long-term decisions need to be made. I do not want to be disingenuous with any of you about who should drive these decisions. I’ve always leaned into my integrity and my values and I felt it was important to be transparent at this juncture about my plans. We all know how demanding our jobs are, but rest assured the work we do matters. Your conviction, your enthusiasm and your love of journalism distinguishes CBS News and fills me with pride. Nothing happens here without each of you, and the dedication and passion of our teams is evident at every level – in every bureau and newsroom. Your commitment to factual reporting with context during challenging times, in our world and our country, is what inspires and encourages me about the future of journalism at CBS News. Over the past four decades, from NPR and CNN to more than 30 years at CBS, I’ve been able to see much of the world, cover most of the major news events of our lifetimes, and, most of all, work with all of you, in the field, in bureaus, on shows, and from the front office. I am so thankful for each and every one of you and am filled with gratitude for what we have accomplished. You are the best in the industry, and it shows on every platform and in every story. I am forever honored to call CBS my News home….so now back to the News! With all my respect, Ingrid",

                    "text": "CBS News President Ingrid Ciprian-Matthews is departing after just months in her role, according to internal network memos. Ciprian-Matthews, a veteran media executive appointed to the role less than a year ago, announced her exit on Wednesday morning in a memo to staffers, adding that she will remain through the transition and the consequential 2024 election cycle. “No journalist wants to ‘be’ the news, especially me. But today, I have some news of my own to share. After much consideration, I’ve decided this is the right time to step away from my current role at CBS News and begin to write my next chapter,” Ciprian-Matthews said. “At the end of the month, I’ll be transitioning to a new role. I have gladly agreed to stay on through the election as a senior editorial advisor to CBS News, given the historical significance of this election and the current political moment,” she added. Ciprian-Matthews was named to the role in August of 2023, serving less than a year. A 30-year veteran of CBS News and an Emmy-winning journalist, Ciprian-Matthews also served as executive vice president for newsgathering. She has held several high-level roles in the company throughout her career, including senior vice president of news administration, vice president of news, CBS News’ foreign editor, senior broadcast producer for “CBS Evening News” and senior producer for CBS News’ foreign coverage. “Some may be asking why I’m announcing this now. We all know our industry and company are going through a transformation and a number of short- and long-term decisions need to be made,” Ciprian-Matthews wrote in her Wednesday memo. “I do not want to be disingenuous with any of you about who should drive these decisions. I’ve always leaned into my integrity and my values and I felt it was important to be transparent at this juncture about my plans.” In a separate memo to staffers, president and CEO of CBS’ News and Stations and Media Ventures Wendy McMahon noted, “Over the past months, Ingrid and I have been talking about this moment we find ourselves in – one of relentless transformation across our industry, and a moment in which we are covering one of the most important stories of our lifetimes.” “Those conversations led Ingrid to the decision she shared with all of you today, and I am pleased that she has agreed to stay on in a new position as senior editorial adviser guiding our political coverage through the election,” McMahon continued. “This newly created role leverages Ingrid’s expertise, particularly as a former Washington bureau chief. She will work directly with our D.C. bureau and political team to contribute significantly and help lead our coverage.”",

                    "text": "CBS News president Ingrid Ciprian-Matthews is stepping down following a string of controversies over her management of the embattled network, including accusations of discriminatory hiring and management practices. The longtime CBS exec, who was named president last August, told staffers Wednesday that she would step down and become a senior advisor for coverage of the 2024 presidential election over the next several months before leaving the company. “No journalist wants to ‘be’ the news, especially me,” Ciprian-Matthews said in a memo to staff obtained by The Post. “But today, I have some news of my own to share. After much consideration, I’ve decided this is the right time to step away from my current role at CBS News and begin to write my next chapter.” CBS News parent company Paramount Global has agreed to merge with Skydance, a deal which will enact a $2 billion cost cutting initiative. Ahead of the deal, Paramount’s co-CEOs have signaled enacting $500 million of cuts across the company. Ciprian-Matthews “will transition into this new role over the next few weeks, and we will share more updates soon,” said Wendy McMahon, president and CEO of CBS’ news, stations and syndication operations, in a memo. A new president of CBS News was not immediately named. Ciprian-Matthews, who has been at the company for more than 30 years, has been a lightning-rod figure at the embattled news network, having racked up human-resources complaints from staffers over unfair hiring practices, as revealed by an investigation by The Post in January. Ciprian-Matthews is the third CBS News exec to cycle through the newsroom’s top job since 2021. She had been promoted when CBS News co-president Neeraj Khemlani was ousted after a short-two-year run which was marred by a slew of HR complaints over bullying, as revealed by The Post.",

                    "text": "Alexandra Daddario has a rainbow baby on the way! The actress is pregnant with her and husband Andrew Form’s first child together after previously experiencing a “painful” loss. The “White Lotus” alum, 38, debuted her baby bump while speaking to Vogue about her “long” journey to motherhood. “I’m pregnant and it’s all successful and everything’s healthy,” Daddario said in an interview published Wednesday, noting that she didn’t feel like she had a right to “complain” about her symptoms. “I had been pregnant,” she explained. “Then I had a loss. It’s long and complicated, so I don’t want to be too specific. Those kinds of losses and trauma are very hard to explain unless you’ve been through them. “I really relate to all the women who have been through those kinds of things in a way that I didn’t understand fully before,” the “Baywatch” star continued. “It’s very, very painful.” The Emmy nominee, who was six months along at the time of the interview, had “a lot of complicated feelings” when she found out that she had conceived again. “It was actually quite hard to process,” she said. Daddario initially tried to hide her pregnancy on the set of “Mayfair Witches” which was a struggle as she was “throwing up and having make-out scenes … right after.” When the “Percy Jackson” star came clean, she joked that “everyone was very understanding about making out with a nauseous, vomiting girl.” Daddario is already the stepmom to Form’s two sons — Rowan and Julian — with his ex-wife, Jordana Brewster. The former couple married in 2007, welcoming both boys via surrogate before separating in 2020. Form, 55, moved on with Daddario the following year, getting down on one knee in August 2021. After the duo married in New Orleans in June 2022, the bride told Willie Geist on “Sunday Today” that she had “always wanted to be a mom.” She gushed, “I think from when I was young, I’ve never been scared of monogamy or settling down or anything like that.”",

The actress, 38, and husband Andrew Form, 55, are expecting their first baby together after four years of marriage, Vogue announced on Wednesday, July 10. The magazine shared that Daddario has been keeping her pregnancy under wraps for six months. Vogue also posted the announcement on their Instagram, sharing serval pictures of The White Lotus star cradling her baby bump. Daddario and her television and film producer husband tied the knot in June. Form was previously married to American-Brazilian actress Jordana Brewster, with whom he shares two sons, Rowan and Julian. Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Daddario told the outlet she's \"overjoyed\" to be pregnant, going on to share she previously experienced a miscarriage \"Well, I had been pregnant,” she said, adding “I had loss.” “It’s long and complicated, so I don’t want to be too specific,” she continued. “Those kinds of losses and trauma are very hard to explain unless you’ve been through them. I really relate to all the women who have been through those kinds of things in a way that I didn’t understand fully before. It’s very, very painful.” On May 13, 2021, Daddario made their relationship public by posting a black-and-white photo of the couple on Instagram. Later that year, a source confirmed to PEOPLE that Daddario and Form were engaged. Roughly six months after getting engaged, Form and Daddario said their \"I dos\" in New Orleans. According to Vogue, the ceremony was held at Preservation Hall with Form's two children serving as his groomsmen and ring bearers. Guests then followed a second line parade through the streets of the city to the reception, Bar Marilou. The couple met by chance during COVID when they bumped into each other on the street in New York. Daddario shared her happiness on Instagram, writing, \"The absolutely most wonderful man, you handle nonsense, loss, life, difficulty, people, with grace and compassion.\" She added that Form took the \"worst moments\" of her life and made everything better. She later shared with PEOPLE, \"I feel very at peace with him and very happy, and I just feel very lucky.\"",

The 38-year-old actress revealed during a new interview that she is pregnant and expecting her first child with husband Andrew Form — and she went through great lengths to hide her pregnancy for a while. “I was on set, and I was throwing up and having make-out scenes with my co-stars right after,” she told Vogue in an interview that was published on Wednesday, July 10. “By week five, I was like, ‘There’s no way I’m going to be able to hide this.'” On the flip side, Alexandra recalled thinking, “If I tell my job that I’m pregnant, I’m going to get a lot of time off to go throw up in peace.” However, that didn’t work out, she clarified. “I have wonderful co-stars who have kids, and everyone was very understanding about making out with a nauseous, vomiting girl.” When she was experiencing morning sickness, the San Andreas star was working on the set of AMC’s Mayfair Witches. Although her eventual announcement was a happy one, Alexandra revealed that she had a “loss” in her past. “Well, I had been pregnant [before],” she said without going into further detail. “It’s long and complicated, so I don’t want to be too specific,” she explained. “Those kinds of losses and trauma are very hard to explain unless you’ve been through them. I really relate to all the women who have been through those kinds of things in a way that I didn’t understand fully before.

Nevertheless, the White Lotus alum had a distraction: her job. “Work was both a stressor and a savior,” she acknowledged. “I was so overwhelmed with work.

He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney wrote. \"Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw. We’re all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we’ve opted to ignore every warning sign,\" he continued. The actor joined a growing list of Hollywood elites and megadonors who've turned on Biden following the debate, where his halting, frail and at-times confused performance alarmed supporters. Members of Biden's party, political allies, and liberal media figures have also pressured the president to drop out of the race, warning he cannot beat former President Trump. GEORGE CLOONEY RUBS ELBOWS WITH BIDEN AT STAR-STUDDED LA FUNDRAISER AFTER CALLING WHITE HOUSE WITH COMPLAINT \"This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president,\" Clooney wrote. Democrats have more to lose than the White House; they are at risk of losing down-ballot races with Biden as the nominee, he argued. \"This isn’t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I’ve spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\" Clooney warned that it was past time to put forward a new candidate and chided Democrats for putting their \"heads in the sand\" on the party's dilemma. \"[T]he dam has broken. We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth,\" he wrote. CHARLAMAGNE SAYS ‘ALL I HEAR IS EGO’ FROM BIDEN, CALLS ON DEMOCRATS TO CHALLENGE HIM FOR NOMINATION AT DNC Clooney called on top Democrats like Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries and Nancy Pelosi, as well as candidates who are at risk of losing their own elections, to pressure Biden to \"voluntarily step aside.\" With Biden off the ticket, other Democratic leaders could come forward and make their case to the American people, he argued. \"Let’s hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others,\" Clooney wrote. \"Would it be messy? Yes. Democracy is messy. But would it enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out? It sure would,\" he continued.

The Biden campaign pointed Fox News Digital to Biden's repeated statements about staying in the race.

                    "text": "U.S. President Joe Biden suffered a stunning blow Wednesday when actor and leading Democratic supporter George Clooney urged him to drop his reelection bid, while party heavyweight Nancy Pelosi declined to back his candidacy. \"I love Joe Biden,\" Clooney, who hosted a star-studded fundraiser with Biden just last month, wrote in the New York Times. \"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. \"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. \"He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\" At the fundraiser in Los Angeles co-hosted by Clooney and fellow movie star Julia Roberts, Biden appeared tired as he took to the stage alongside former president Barack Obama. He had flown straight to California from the G7 summit in Italy and has since blamed jetlag, and a cold, for his disastrous performance in a June 27 television debate with Donald Trump. Biden's bid for a second term in the White House has been under severe pressure since the debate, in which he slurred his words and stood with mouth agape while Trump talked. While top Democrats broadly but unenthusiastically backed him on Tuesday, Biden's efforts to turn the page took a leap backwards with the interventions of Pelosi and Clooney. Former House speaker Pelosi, 86, said time was running out for Biden to decide whether to end his candidacy, ignoring Biden’s repeated insistence that he is committed to run. \"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" she told MSNBC. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because the time is running short.\" Pelosi said Biden should however delay any final decision until after NATO's 75th anniversary summit in Washington, which the US president is hosting this week. - 'Cover-up' - On the way to the summit on Wednesday, Biden dropped in on US union leaders in a further bid to shore up backing for his reelection bid. Biden's appearances at the NATO gathering are being closely watched as he tries to reassure allies of his continued ability to lead as the alliance backs Ukraine's fight against Russia. Seven House Democrats have openly called on Biden to not seek reelection. A handful of senators have also expressed concerns. Late Tuesday, Colorado's Michael Bennet became the first Senate Democrat to publicly turn on the president, saying Biden would lose if he stayed on the ballot -- and perhaps cause congressional Democrats to lose as well. \"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House,\" Bennet told CNN, adding he believes the White House \"has done nothing\" to demonstrate they have a plan to win in November. Republican challenger Trump, 78, is meanwhile back on the warpath after a long interval of silence following the June 27 debate, accusing Biden of hiding secrets about his health. \"It's the biggest cover-up in political history,\" Trump thundered at a rally in Florida on Tuesday. The former president dared his successor to another debate without moderators and challenged him to a round of golf.",

                    "title": "From George Clooney to eighth House lawmaker, more voices unite in urging Biden to end candidacy - UPI.com",
                    "text": "July 10 (UPI) -- Rep. Pat Ryan, D-N.Y., and actor George Clooney on Wednesday joined a growing number of Democrats and Democratic Party supporters urging President Joe Biden to end his re-election campaign. Several of Biden's campaign advisers also have scheduled a Thursday meeting with Senate Democrats to discuss his presidential campaign and chances of winning re-election. Ryan is the eighth Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives to urge Biden to withdraw his candidacy. He said he wants Biden to step down and make way for a \"new generation of leaders,\" especially one who might be better able to defeat former President Donald Trump. Trump is the presumptive GOP nominee and is expected to secure the Republican nomination during the GOP's national convention in Milwaukee that runs from Monday through Thursday. \"Trump is an existential threat to American democracy,\" Ryan said. \"It is our duty to put forth the strongest candidate against him.\" He said Biden no longer is that candidate. Actor George Clooney in an op-ed published Wednesday in the New York Times said he is a \"lifelong Democrat\" and \"proud of what my party represents and what it stands for.\" Clooney said the Democratic Party can't win another term in the Oval Office with Biden as a candidate and joined a growing chorus of voices urging him to resign. Despite his expressed love and support for Biden, Clooney urged the president to withdraw his candidacy for a second term in office just weeks after helping raise tens of millions of dollars for his re-election campaign. Clooney said in June that he, actress Julia Roberts and former President Barack Obama \"co-hosted the single largest fundraiser supporting any Democratic candidate ever for President Biden's re-election.\" That event raised about $30 million for Biden's re-election campaign, but Clooney now wants a different presidential candidate on the Democratic Party ticket. \"I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president,\" Clooney said. \"I consider him a friend.\" Clooney said he believes in Biden's character and morals and said Biden has \"won many of the battles he's faced\" over the past four years. \"The one battle he cannot win is the fight against time,\" Clooney said. Clooney said the Biden the nation witnessed during the June 27 presidential debate with Trump wasn't the same Biden he knew in 2010, 2020 or during the fundraiser that he co-hosted three weeks ago. \"We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign,\" Clooney said. \"Our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51million people didn't see what we just saw,\" Clooney said of Biden's performance during the June debate. \"The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before.\" He said Democrats \"collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president ... walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\" He said the problem is Biden's age and its effect on his mental acuity, which can't be reversed. \"We are not going to win in November with this president,\" Clooney said. \"On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate.\" He said every senator, representative and governor with whom he's spoken in private agrees Biden's candidacy will lose the presidency, House and Senate to the Republican Party during the Nov. 5 election. Clooney wants Biden to withdraw his candidacy and allow the Democratic Party to nominate a different candidate during its national convention in Chicago that starts on Aug. 19. Biden, though, said he won't withdraw, especially after dominating the recent Democratic Party state primaries and securing 3,896 delegates when only 1,968 are needed to secure the party's nomination. Biden said the people have spoken and want him to run for re-election. He called his debate performance one bad night among 3.5 years of political success as a president and a lifetime as a Democratic lawmaker. Despite his apparent intent to stay in the race, the traditional Democratic Party stronghold of New York has become a swing state that Trump might win. During the past four months, Biden's polling lead in New York has slipped from eight points to a virtual tie, Politico reported Wednesday. The poll movement comes despite Trump's recent conviction in a Manhattan court on 34 felony counts related to a non-disclosure agreement with and payment to former porn actress Stormy Daniels in 2016. Biden hasn't campaigned in New York and apparently is counting on the state's voters to give him New York's 28 electoral votes. \"We're still acting like this is a one-party state, which for pretty much 20, 25 years it has been,\" Mark Levine, the Democratic Manhattan Borough president, told Politico. \"I truly believe we're a battleground state now,\" Levine said.",

Vice Chairman of the Laos – Vietnam Cooperation Committee Viengsavanh Vilayphone said that the visit will create an opportunity for Lam, his Lao counterpart Thongloun Sisoulith and many other Lao leaders to review and evaluate the cooperation ties between the two parties and states over the past time, and exchange viewpoints and reach consensus on orientations, policies and measures to bolster the bilateral ties to a deeper and more effective manner in 2024 and the following years. Vietnam’s support in economy and many other sectors has been significant to the Lao Government and people, adding Laos always opens its door for Vietnamese firms, including private businesses that boast financial, science-tech and competitive capacity, the Lao scholar said. Laos has been the largest recipient of Vietnamese overseas investment so far, he said, adding Vietnam’s projects have helped Laos take care of its residents, particularly those living in the remote and border areas. Along with generating incomes and improve local livelihoods, Vietnamese enterprises have contributed to nurturing the special solidarity between the two nations, he underlined. The Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security handed over the Academy of Politics of the Lao People’s Public Security to the Lao ministry last year, he said, describing the project as an exemplary one in the bilateral cooperation. During his stay in Laos, Lam will witness the signing and exchange of various documents that facilitate Vietnamese firms’ business operation in Laos, he said, adding the Lao side expects more Vietnamese investments in the nation following his visit. The visit to Laos by President Lam is expected to make contributions to fostering the Vietnam – Laos special ties for peace, stability, cooperation and sustainable development in the region and the world./.",

                    "text": "Hanoi (VNA) – President To Lam’s upcoming State visit to Laos is a vivid demonstration of the special friendship and comprehensive cooperation between Laos and Vietnam, stated Lao Ambassador to Vietnam Khamphao Ernthavanh. Speaking to Vietnam News Agency (VNA) ahead of the visit, the ambassador said that President Lam’s choosing Laos as the destination for his first trip abroad as the State leader of Vietnam shows the special attention and priority that Vietnam attaches to Laos. Sharing close neighbourliness, a long-standing historical relationship and mutual support during different historical periods, leaders and people of Laos and Vietnam have worked together to reinforce their great friendship and special solidarity initiated by President Ho Chi Minh, President Kaysone Phomvihane and President Souphanouvong. The two countries have supported each other throughout their national construction and defence process, she noted. During President Lam’s visit, the two sides will review their cooperation over the years, seeking measures to remove difficulties and obstacles facing their partnership and sketching out future collaboration orientations towards the purpose of further enhancing their comprehensive cooperation, the diplomat said. Noting that the regional and international situation is increasingly complicated, impacting countries around the world including Vietnam and Laos, the ambassador underlined that Laos and Vietnam need to strengthen their great relationship, special friendship and comprehensive cooperation, and support each other to overcome all difficulties and thrive together. Regarding economic cooperation between the two countries over the years, Ambassador Khamphao Ernthavanh held that the two sides have worked hard together to promote partnership in trade, investment, agriculture and infrastructure development, while two-way trade has expanded stably. Many large-scale Vietnamese-funded projects in Laos, especially in the fields of energy, mining and agriculture, have not only contributed to the economic growth of Laos but also created many employment opportunities for locals, she said. The diplomat said that leaders of the two countries have repeatedly emphasised the need to strengthen connectivity between the two economies and coordination in growth orientations for the interests of both peoples. She highlighted the active coordination among leaders of the Party, State, localities, organisations and businesses of Vietnam and Laos in realising agreements reached between senior leaders of the two sides in economy and trade as well as implementing Vietnamese-invested projects in Laos. In order to beef up bilateral economic and trade cooperation, the two sides should focus on strengthening and promoting the efficiency of economic-trade cooperation mechanisms from central to local levels, she said. Ministries and sectors of the two countries should concentrate on implementing signed economic-trade cooperation plans, create favourable conditions for investors and businesses of the two sides to cooperate, exchange experience and explore each other’s strengths for stronger partnership, the diplomat stressed. Mentioning measures to promote cooperation among Laos, Vietnam and ASEAN countries in the ASEAN Year 2024 spirit of “Enhancing Connectivity and Resilience,” Ambassador Khamphao Ernthavanh said that Vietnam plays an important role in strengthening solidarity and centrality of ASEAN. President Lam once affirmed that ASEAN is a family of close neighbours, said the ambassador, holding that the Vietnamese leader’s first State visit to Laos, the ASEAN Chair for 2024, will contribute to further deepen the special friendship and comprehensive between Vietnam and Laos as well as between Vietnam, Laos and ASEAN member countries. ASEAN will continue to strive for regional peace, stability and security. Dialogue and cooperation are essential in solving multidimensional, complex and unpredictable challenges. Laos, as Chair of ASEAN, aims to optimise ASEAN's potential for peace, security, stability and shared prosperity, stated the diplomat. President Lam's visit to Laos will emphasise the importance of ASEAN's solidarity, self-reliance and regional cooperation, in which Vietnam plays an important role, the Lao ambassador concluded./.",

A joint communique from all 32 NATO allies meeting in Washington is expected later Wednesday to cement that “irreversible” NATO commitment to Ukraine, a European official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss it before its release. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has battled for at least a firm guarantee from NATO that Ukraine can join the military alliance. The U.S. and some other countries have opposed membership for Ukraine while the conflict with Russia continues to avoid allies being drawn into a larger war. They also have stressed that Ukraine must make significant steps to address corruption as well as other systemic reforms. Russian President Vladimir Putin has long bitterly opposed neighboring Ukraine’s fight to join the Western alliance, declaring it an encroachment on Russia’s security and interests. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg underlined that Ukraine will not join the alliance’s ranks immediately. “To invite a new ally, we need consensus. All allies agree that Ukraine will become a member but it’s too early to say when that will happen,” he told reporters.",

                    "text": "WASHINGTON — Ukraine is on an “irreversible” path to NATO membership, U.S. and European officials said Wednesday, advancing assurances from allies that it will be allowed to join the Western military coalition after its war with Russia ends. In another boost for Ukraine, the U.S., the Netherlands and Denmark announced Wednesday that the first NATO-provided F-16s were on their way to Ukraine and would be flying this summer following months of work. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted his appreciation on the effort to strengthen his air force, coming soon after Ukraine saw one of the deadliest strikes of the war. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Czech President Petr Pavel, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo all used the word “irreversible” to describe the way forward for Ukraine as NATO leaders gathered for a summit in Washington. Stubb and Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs both said the language was expected in the final summit declaration from all 32 NATO allies. “I think it’s very important to give a message to the Kremlin from here — that Ukraine’s path and bridge towards NATO membership is now irreversible,” Stubb told reporters. Zelensky, fearing his country would otherwise be left to fight a stronger Russia indefinitely, has battled for at least a firm guarantee from NATO that Ukraine can join the military alliance. The U.S. and some other countries have opposed membership for Ukraine during the conflict with Russia to avoid an escalation of tensions that could lead to a larger war. They also have stressed that Ukraine must take significant steps to address corruption as well as other systemic reforms. Russian President Vladimir Putin has long bitterly opposed neighboring Ukraine’s fight to join the Western alliance, declaring it an encroachment on Russia’s security and interests. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg underlined that Ukraine will not join the alliance’s ranks immediately. But he insisted that must happen after the war is over to ensure that Russia never attacks Ukraine again. “I strongly believe that when the fighting stops, we need to ensure that Ukraine has the capabilities to deter future aggression from Russia, and they need security guarantees,” Stoltenberg said. President Biden, who later appeared on stage with Stoltenberg, reaffirmed U.S. support for Ukraine but also more broadly the importance of NATO. He reiterated that since he took office, the number of allies spending at least 2% of their gross domestic product on defense has increased from nine to 23 and that the number of battle groups has doubled on NATO’s eastern flank. “We can and will defend every inch of NATO territory, and we will do it together,” Biden said. Zelensky, in Washington for the NATO summit, had stressed what he called Ukraine’s urgent need for the F-16 fighter jets in a speech to friendly Republican lawmakers Tuesday night. He said his country needed more than 100 to start to counter devastating Russian air attacks on Ukraine’s cities, energy infrastructure and other vital targets. He said Russia was using 300 jets to carry out the attacks. In a post on X, Zelensky thanked the three countries “for taking practical steps to achieve the goal of all Ukrainians: to strengthen the Ukrainian air force with F-16s.” The first flight-ready jets were being transferred by the Netherlands and Denmark, and the White House said they would be “flying operational” this summer. Zelensky also thanked Belgium and Norway for their commitment to send the jets. Separately on Wednesday, the U.S. and Germany announced they would begin “episodic deployments” of long-range missiles to Germany in 2026, including Tomahawk, SM-6 and hypersonic missiles. The announcement is notable because land-based firing of some of those missiles from within Europe would have been banned under the former Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. The missiles were banned by the treaty because the conventional missiles could have been modified to be nuclear capable and their use on the European continent would have meant that potential targets would have had no time to react. Kimball said while the deployment is likely being done to reassure allies, Russia may respond by deploying conventional or nuclear weapons of its own. European and U.S. allies have announced other new arms deliveries, such as dozens of air defense systems, including Patriots, this week. Opposition from Republican lawmakers allied to former President Donald Trump had blocked a U.S. support package to Ukraine for months earlier this year, allowing Russia to make battlefield gains against Ukrainian forces who were fighting with dwindling arms and ammunition. Europeans and NATO, as a lesson from that setback, have vowed to take on more of the responsibility for ensuring a reliable flow of military support to Ukraine. Trump, meanwhile, pushed back on claims that he wants the U.S. to exit NATO as he campaigns for a second term, telling Fox News Radio that “I want them to pay their bills.” Cook reported from Brussels.

                    "text": "NATO nation leaders, in a Washington summit declaration released Wednesday, said Ukraine is on an \"irreversible path\" to NATO membership. The summit declaration, signed by all 32 NATO nations, offers some of the strongest language yet about the organization's intent to eventually include Ukraine in its membership. Ukraine and its protection are a central part of this year's NATO summit in Washington, D.C., hosted by President Biden. The declaration, which encompasses NATO's beliefs and goals, says Ukraine \"has become increasingly interoperable and politically integrated with the alliance.\"\"We welcome the concrete progress Ukraine has made since the Vilnius Summit on its required democratic, economic, and security reforms,\" the declaration says. \"As Ukraine continues this vital work, we will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership. We reaffirm that we will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree and conditions are met.\"However, the alliance's statement did not offer a specific timeline for membership for Ukraine, which has sought to formalize its ties with Europe and the U.S. When NATO leaders convened one year ago, they affirmed that Ukraine would eventually become a member of the organization. Last year, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Ukraine had made \"good progress\" toward membership but needed to do more, including enacting military and democratic reforms. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was critical of last year's statement.Mr. Biden, who faces a test of his fitness to be the Democratic nominee, made Ukraine a key focus of his opening speech at the summit. \"We know Putin won't stop at Ukraine. But make no mistake — Ukraine can and will stop Putin,\" the president said of Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"Especially with our full, collective support. They have our full support.\" Mr. Biden insisted NATO is as important now as it ever was, citing terrorist threats and Russia's two-year-old war with Ukraine. The president announced a donation of air defense equipment for Ukraine from the U.S., Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Italy. In the coming months, the U.S. and its partners will provide Ukraine with dozens of additional tactical air defense systems, he said. Zelenskyy has been making the most of his time in Washington, meeting with leaders on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. Zelenskyy has met with House Speaker Mike Johnson as well as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, as he continues to request more funding and supplies to defend his country against Russia's invasion.",

                    "text": "WASHINGTON – Ukraine is on an “irreversible” path to NATO membership after Russia’s war on Europe’s largest country brought Kyiv and the security alliance closer than ever, member nations said in the 2024 NATO Summit’s official declaration. “Ukraine’s future is in NATO. Ukraine has become increasingly interoperable and politically integrated with the alliance,” the declaration said. “As Ukraine continues this vital work, we will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership.” The summit’s official statement came out as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited congressional leaders on Capitol Hill Wednesday. Though Ukraine is not yet a NATO member, Zelensky made the trek to Washington for the event, which has largely revolved around helping Kyiv win its fight. After meeting with Zelensky, House Speaker Mike Johnson gave his support for the country, pushing for the Biden administration to lift its restrictions on where and when Ukraine can fire American weapons into Russia. “I explained that the will of Congress was to allow them the flexibility to use the weapons and assistance that were sent to prosecute the war as they see fit,” Johnson said. “So I’m a supporter of that. I believe that’s what Congress intended.” Currently, Ukraine does not have Biden’s blessing to fire long-distance weapons such as ATACMS – which have a range of roughly 186 miles – deep into Russian territory. Biden only sent the highly effective ballistic missile system this year, but it represented a significant advancement in Kyiv’s capabilities. The international alliance agreed at the summit that it would continue to help bringing Ukraine’s defense forces up to NATO standards, as it has done through training Ukraine’s forces and donations of NATO-grade military equipment, according to the declaration. “The Summit decisions by NATO and the NATO-Ukraine Council, combined with Allies’ ongoing work, constitute a bridge to Ukraine’s membership in NATO,” it said. “Allies will continue to support Ukraine’s progress on interoperability as well as additional democratic and security sector reforms.” The declaration did not provide a concrete timeline for Ukraine’s ascension into the security alliance, however, leaving it unclear whether it would happen before its war with Russia winds down. Ukraine will soon take a big step toward its integration with NATO defense standards with the coming delivery of about 78 F-16 fighter jets from the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and Belgium, the first of which will take to the Ukrainian skies “this summer,” US, Danish and Dutch leaders announced Wednesday. The declaration is bound to draw the ire of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who cited preventing NATO encroachment and stopping Kyiv from joining the 32-member security alliance in his decision to invade Ukraine in February 2022. The alliance took care to say it “does not seek confrontation, and poses no threat to Russia,” in its declaration, noting that member nations “remain willing to maintain channels of communication with Moscow to mitigate risk and prevent escalation.” Still, it did not hold back from calling out Russia for its illegal invasion of Ukraine – and issued sharp criticism of Moscow’s continued reliance on its possession of nuclear weapons to bully the West into abandoning Kyiv. “We condemn Russia’s irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and coercive nuclear signaling, including its announced stationing of nuclear weapons in Belarus, which demonstrate a posture of strategic intimidation,” it said. “Russia has increased its reliance on nuclear weapon systems and continued to diversify its nuclear forces, including by developing novel nuclear systems and deploying short and intermediate range dual-capable strike capabilities, all of which poses a growing threat to the alliance,” the declaration added.",

During the rally from Doral, Florida, Trump told the crowd that he was “offering” Biden the opportunity to “redeem himself” after his lackluster performance at the presidential debate on June 27. In the aftermath of Biden’s debate performance, the president has faced calls from Democrats, donors, and voters to “step aside” and withdraw from the race. “Tonight, I’m officially offering Joe the chance to redeem himself in front of the entire world,” Trump told the crowd. “So, Marco, and Byron and everybody, here’s what we’re going to do. You guys can be referees if you like, let’s do another debate this week so that Sleepy Joe Biden can prove to everyone all over the world that he has what it takes to be president.

                    "text": "The cover stars for NBA 2K25 have been revealed, with the series featuring NBA champion Jayson Tatum and WNBA champion A’Ja Wilson in its first-ever dual-league cover. 2024 Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Vince Carter will also feature on the cover of the pricey Hall of Fame edition. Tatum will be on the cover of the NBA 2K25 standard edition, in addition to the All-Star edition where he will be joined by Wilson. Regarding the reveal, Tatum said: “It’s an honor to be named a cover athlete. “I’ve been playing NBA 2K since I was a kid and it’s been a dream to one day be on the cover,” he continued, “even after coming off an NBA Championship, it’s humbling to see this come to life.” Wilson will be featured on the WBNA edition, which will be available as a physical copy that is exclusive to GameStop in the US and Canada. “Being featured on the NBA 2K25 cover is a big moment for me and a testament to the ever-growing fandom of the WNBA,” she said. “Seeing more and more WNBA athletes scanned into NBA 2K25 to best capture the style and confidence of the league has been empowering, and I can't wait for fans to experience it in-game.” As the cover star of the Hall of Fame edition, Carter said: “Between the honors NBA 2K and the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame have bestowed upon me, this year is an unforgettable one, making me pause with gratitude at my career. Being named a cover athlete would have always been a special moment for me, but it is a particular honor to be on the cover of the NBA 2K25 Hall of Fame edition.” You can see each cover for yourself below. NBA 2K25 is shaping up to be a solid evolution in the long-running basketball franchise, introducing mode parity between PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and PC for the very first time. These consoles will also benefit from ProPLAY technology, which further enhances the realism of the simulation. This is on top of more MyNBA content and an overhauled interactive city environment for players to explore. But how much will it cost? Each version of the game comes at a different price and is set to arrive on a range of platforms when it launches on September 6. Here's a quick breakdown of everything that you need to know. The standard edition of NBA 2K25 will be available for $69.99 / £69.99 on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.

The WNBA edition is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S and will cost $69.99. It will only be available physically and is currently not planned for release outside of the US and Canada. The All-Star edition is then priced at $99.99 / £89.99 and will be released for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. It will include 100,000 VC in addition to the following MyTEAM content: 10 MyTeam Player Cards, 3 Diamond Shoe Cards, 3 Takeover Boosts, and 1 Amethyst Coach Card.

And while his latest achievement might not compare to winning an NBA title, it’s validation of his recent success. Tatum was officially named the cover athlete for the standard edition cover of NBA 2K25. He will also appear alongside WNBA star A’ja Wilson on the All-Star edition of the game: Tatum, 26, was one of the central pillars in the Celtics’ recent run to the team’s 18th NBA championship. Already a five-time All-Star, he’s the first athlete to represent a Boston pro sports team on the cover of a video game since Tom Brady with Madden NFL 18. Trivia: Who is the most recent Celtic to be on the NBA 2K cover? (Answer at the bottom). Hint: He played against the Celtics in the 2024 playoffs. Scores and schedules: The Red Sox got a 12-9 win over the Athletics on Tuesday. Wilyer Abreu hit a home run and drove in four runs, while Rafael Devers delivered with a pair of hits and three RBIs of his own. The two teams play against at Fenway Park this evening at 7:10 p.m. More from Boston.com: Rafael Devers bows out of All-Star Game, then helps Red Sox beat A’s 12-9 Projecting Bruins 2024-25 lineup: Could Bruins opt for youth movement up front?

Brayan Bello marked his return to the rotation with a microcosm of his season to this point: periodic dominance, but inconsistent. On this day: In 2013, David Ortiz became the all-time leader in hits as a designated hitter, going 2-for-3 with a home run in an 11-4 win over the Mariners. Daily highlight: At just 16, Spanish winger Lamine Yamal became the youngest goalscorer in European Championship history in the 2-1 comeback win against France on Tuesday. Spain will play in the final on Sunday at 3 p.m. against the winner of the other semifinal (between England and the Netherlands on Wednesday). Trivia answer: Kyrie Irving (NBA 2K18)",

Tatum is fresh off of leading the Celtics to an NBA record 18th championship, and just signed a five-year, $314 million contract extension to become the highest paid player in league history. Tatum is a five-time All-Star, while also being named to the All NBA First Team in each of the past three seasons. Wilson has led the Aces to back-to-back WNBA championships and was named the WNBA Finals MVP in 2023. The Aces star has also taken home the last two Defensive Player of the Year Awards and is off to a strong start in the 2024 campaign. Carter played for eight NBA teams throughout his career, but will be remembered a great deal for his time with the Toronto Raptors early on. The talented forward appeared in eight All-Star Games and will be inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame next month.",

It's atypical.\" \"Prosecutors have not come close to meeting their burden to show you that any of the gold or cash was given to Senator Menendez as a bribe,\" Fee said.\"This is a case with a lot of inferences,\" he said, suggesting there were large gaps in the evidence that was unsupported by emails, texts or other evidence.The longtime lawmaker faces 16 felony counts, including obstruction of justice, acting as a foreign agent, bribery, extortion and honest services wire fraud. After the jury was sent home Tuesday, Fee told Judge Sidney Stein that he was about halfway through a five-hour closing that will resume Wednesday morning. His closing will be followed by arguments from two other defense lawyers before prosecutors present a rebuttal argument. The jury is likely to get the case on Thursday.Earlier Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Monteleoni said in a closing argument that began Monday that the senator had engaged in \"wildly abnormal\" behavior in response to bribes, including trying to interfere in criminal cases handled by the top state and federal prosecutors in New Jersey.Menendez has pleaded not guilty to charges that he accepted bribes including gold and envelopes of cash from 2018 to 2022 from three New Jersey businessmen who wanted his help in their business ventures.His trial entered its ninth week on Monday.Menendez is on trial with two of the businessmen — Wael Hana and Fred Daibes. Hana, who prosecutors say enlisted Menendez to help him protect a monopoly on the certification of meat exported from the U.S. to Egypt, and Daibes, an influential real estate developer, have also both pleaded not guilty. A third businessman, Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty and testified that he bought a Mercedes-Benz convertible for the senator's wife in exchange for Menendez quashing criminal investigations into his business associates. Monteleoni rejected attempts by the defense to make it seem that Menendez was unaware of efforts to get cash or favors from the businessmen by his then-girlfriend, Nadine Arslanian, who became his wife in October 2020. Fee has argued that she went to great lengths to hide her financial troubles, including an inability to pay for her home, from Menendez.To demonstrate his point that Menendez was in charge of bribery schemes, the prosecutor pointed to testimony about a small bell the senator allegedly used to summon his wife one day when he was outside their home with Uribe and wanted her to bring him paper.The bell \"showed you he was the one in charge,\" Monteleoni said, \"not a puppet having his strings pulled by someone he summons with a bell.\" Nadine Menendez also is charged in the case, but her trial has been postponed while she recovers from breast cancer surgery.Menendez has resisted calls, even by some prominent Democrats, that he resign, though he did relinquish his powerful post as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after the charges were unveiled last fall.Several weeks ago, Menendez filed to run for reelection this year as an independent.",

                    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Sen. Bob Menendez’s lawyer tried to convince a New York jury Wednesday that there’s nothing to the federal government’s bribery case against the Democrat. “This case, it dies here today,” attorney Adam Fee told the Manhattan federal court jury as it heard closing arguments for a third day. He said the government had failed to prove “that Bob’s actions were anything other than what we want our elected officials to do.” “He was doing his job. He was doing it well,” Fee added. Menendez, 70, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he accepted gold bars and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash from 2018 to 2022 from three New Jersey businessmen and agreed to take official actions that would benefit their interests, including financially. The New Jersey senator is on trial with two businessmen, Fred Daibes and Wael Hana, who also have pleaded not guilty. Daibes is a prominent New Jersey real estate developer while Hana obtained a monopoly to certify that meat exported to Egypt complied with Islamic rules. A third businessman, Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty and testified against the others during the trial. A trial for the senator’s wife, Nadine Menendez, 57, has been postponed while she recovers from breast cancer surgery. She also has pleaded not guilty in the bribery case. The jury was expected to begin deliberations sometime Thursday after the judge instructs them on the law following closing arguments by lawyers for Daibes and Hana, along with a rebuttal summation by prosecutors. Closing arguments began Monday, when Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Monteleoni told jurors that, when they review evidence, they will see that Dabies and Hana were directly responsible for gold bars and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash found in a 2022 FBI raid of the Menendez’s Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, residence. The prosecutor said Daibes’ fingerprints “were all over the tape sealing up” envelopes stuffed with thousands of dollars of cash that were found in cardboard boxes, a safe, boots and jackets in the home. Menendez’s fingerprints sometimes were found on the envelopes too, he added. He told jurors they will be able to match serial numbers on the gold bars to show that Hana gave seven 1-ounce gold bars found in the home, while Daibes contributed nine 1-ounce bars, along with four 1-kilogram gold bars. “Why did Daibes and Hana shower Menendez and his wife with these valuables?” Monteleoni asked. “What were they getting when they parted with hundreds of thousands of dollars of gold, cash and other payments? The promise of power. “Robert Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from the state of New Jersey, the ranking member and then chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, put his power up for sale,” he said. In return, prosecutors say, Hana received support and protection for his monopoly on the certification of meat exports to Egypt while Daibes received help in his business interests and efforts by the senator to disrupt a federal criminal prosecution against him by recommending a longtime friend as U.S. attorney after the election of President Joe Biden.",

                    "text": "During a closing argument that stretched for nearly six hours over two days, a lawyer for Senator Robert Menendez tried to take apart the vast and complicated case that prosecutors spent weeks building against his client, calling it “painfully thin.” Mr. Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who is being tried alongside two businessmen, has been indicted on 16 felony counts, including bribery, extortion, obstruction of justice, acting as a foreign agent and conspiracy. Prosecutors have shown jurors hundreds of text messages, emails, bank records and photographs of nearly half a million dollars in cash and gold bars that were found in the Englewood Cliffs, N.J., home of Mr. Menendez, 70, and his wife Nadine, 57. The couple received the gifts between 2018 and 2022 in exchange for political favors, the government says. But Adam Fee, one of Mr. Menendez’s lawyers, said in a closing argument on Wednesday that prosecutors had failed to connect any of that evidence to an act of bribery or corruption. Mr. Menendez’s actions, such as calling government officials about investigations involving constituents or pushing for aid to Egypt, were part of his job.",

                    "text": "Aidan O'Connell's progress in 2024 is one of the most important aspects of the Raiders season. If he can win the starting quarterback job over Gardner Minshew II, build on the success he had as a starter last season and prove he deserves to be the starter in 2025 then the Raiders will truly be heading in the right direction. But there's a good chance he's not even going to tick off the first box of that checklist. There's bound to be support for O'Connell among the Raiders' faithful. That's natural after a surprising rookie season where he went 5-5 as the starter and tossed 12 touchdowns to seven interceptions. But a good stretch as a rookie is far from proving that he can be the franchise quarterback. Just ask his primary competition for the starting job. Minshew went 6-6 as a rookie with 21 touchdowns to six interceptions as a sixth-round pick in 2019. It was good enough to convince the Jaguars that he should be the starter the following season and the Jags proceeded to win just one game in his eight starts before he was injured and ultimately battled for the starting job with Mike Glennon. Minshew has revealed that he's a good enough quarterback to keep a team around .500. He's a capable starter who can suffice with good coaching and a strong supporting cast. But he's not the kind of gifted passer who is going to command a massive contract and win Super Bowls. O'Connell is likely to wind up with a similar career arc despite showing some positives last season.",

Fields is the younger and more mobile option for the Steelers, and he will be talked about at every underperforming second of Wilson's season. Wilson barely threw for 3,000 yards in Denver and had just 26 touchdown passes. Those numbers are not good enough when you compare them to the elite quarterbacks across the NFL.

Dak Prescott said the wide receiver, \"looks like CeeDee Lamb\" in a piece by Todd Archer of ESPN. Fellow wide receiver Brandin Cooks was vocal in his support of his teammate as well. \"Whatever the expectation is for him out there, I'm telling you he's going to crush it. He's ready.\" Everything seems to be coming up Jalen Tolbert right now. Prescott and Cooks are also doing what good veterans leaders should be doing. They are shining a positive light on their teammate who is working toward getting better. But there's a long way to go for Tolbert to prove that he can be the reliable receiver he was supposed to be coming out of South Alabama. Supposed to be might be too strong of a phrase in that case. Tolbert is a victim of lofty expectations. As a rookie, he had every opportunity to grab a role in the offense, but he clearly wasn't ready. He wound up with just two receptions for 12 yards. This time last year he was once again a popular breakout candidate because of the opportunity in front of him. With Lamb and Cooks set to be the top two receivers, he only had to be better than Michael Gallup to become the team's No. 3. He fell short of those expectations with just 22 receptions and 268 yards on 36 targets. The reality is that Tolbert might not be able to outperform his draft slot as a former third-round pick and the Cowboys have other potential breakout candidates, such as sixth-round pick Ryan Flournoy or second-year receiver Jalen Brooks.",

                    "text": "The Eagles secondary was one of the worst in the league over the back half of the season. It was clearly a focal point for general manager Howie Roseman this offseason. They hired Vic Fangio to take over as defensive coordinator and made several additions. One of those additions is second-round pick Cooper DeJean. The Eagles double-dipped in the secondary with their first two picks, pairing the Iowa defensive back with Quinyon Mitchell. DeJean was one of the most exciting defensive backs in college football. The All-American had seven interceptions over the last two seasons and returned three of them for touchdowns and did damage as a returner on special teams. His versatility was undoubtedly a strength that the Eagles liked, but it could make it hard for him to make an impression as a rookie. Defensive backs coach Christian Parker has acknowledged they are giving DeJean reps at multiple positions without trying to put too much on his plate. It would appear slot is his best bet to get on the field early, but the Eagles have competition everywhere in the secondary. Avonte Maddox has a ton of experience in the role and C.J. Gardner-Johnson is always an option for it too. At outside corner, the Eagles have Darius Slay, Mitchell and Isaiah Rodgers who is getting hype of his own after being suspended for the entire 2023 season for violating the league's gambling policy. DeJean is eventually going to be a weapon in the secondary. He has great ball skills and can play a variety of alignments. But that progression might be slower than most would like from a high-profile draft pick.",

                    "text": "Samsung Unpacked in July 2024 brought lots of the news you'd expect: new gadgets. And because it's a tech event in 2024, a focus on AI. But it was a particularly noteworthy event for Samsung, considering it launched an entirely new product category during Unpacked. We've got info on all the big news revealed during the livestream, so let's get into it. Samsung Galaxy Ring The tech giant launched its highly anticipated Galaxy Ring at Unpacked on Wednesday. As you might expect, it's a wearable focused on health. Notably, it has a strong focus on sleep, using an AI algorithm to help users better understand their sleep patterns. The idea is to have a wearable that you can actually wear all the time. Samsung promised a lightweight design and a battery life of up to seven days. The Galaxy Ring, of course, is seemingly in direct competition with the already popular Oura Ring, which just launched an AI-powered advisor component to its product. Galaxy Ring pre-orders start on Wednesday. It'll be widely available on July 24. Pricing starts at $399.99. Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra Samsung dropped its new, premium watch aimed at competing with the Apple Watch Ultra. Some of the promised upgrades include an increased battery life, extreme durability, and very detailed tracking of your workouts. Basically, if you're really into triathlons, or hiking/camping, or some other such activity, then it might just be the watch for you. But the most striking new feature added to the Galaxy Watch Ultra is its new sleep apnea sensor, which detects whether you have mild-to-severe breathing issues while you sleep. It's FDA-authorized, too. Pre-orders start on Wednesday. It'll be widely available on July 24. The Galaxy Watch Ultra will cost a hefty $649.99. Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 OK, so if the Ultra is too much, maybe the Watch 7 would be just right for you. For one, pricing starts at $299.99. It promises lots of what we've come to expect from smart watches. It's added a few bells and whistles, including the aforementioned AI-powered sleep tool that comes with the Galaxy Ring. You can also use the Watch 7 to take a body composition snapshot, which feels odd to me but might be appealing to some folks out there. Samsung also promised the Watch 7 will run faster and have an even more accurate GPS feature. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 What would a tech event be without phones? Chief among them is the Z Fold 6. Samsung promised that the phone would be fast and, yep, you guessed it, optimized for AI. The Google Gemini app is integrated into the phone, meaning it has a built-in AI assistant. The company noted that AI could help folks do things like plan travel or take detailed, transcribed notes of a meeting. The phone itself, of course, folds as the name would suggest. Samsung announced that its latest offerings represent the slimmest and lightest Galaxy Z series yet. Despite this, the company has worked to create a more durable product. Additionally, Samsung highlighted the Galaxy Z Assurance program, which offers screen repair services for broken devices. The Z Fold 6 is available for pre-order starting Wednesday, will be widely available July 24, and will start at $1,899.99. Not cheap! Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 The tech giant also debuted its Galaxy Z Flip 6, which is the relatively cheaper option when compared to the Fold 6. The smaller Z Flip 6 still promises to provide the customizability afforded the folding screen of the Z Fold 6. It, too, integrates AI features and promises a super-high-end camera experience. So, for instance, you could auto-respond to a text quickly while doing other things, courtesy of AI and a multi-functional display. The Z Flip 6 will still run you at least $1,099.99. Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro While perhaps not the most exciting news of the day, Samsung also released new versions of its Galaxy Buds and Buds Pro. And guess what? They'll have AI features. One neat feature, however, was Interpreter. It allows users to put a Galaxy Z Fold 6 or Flip 6 into listening mode and have what someone is saying directly interpreted into their Buds. Samsung also promised improved voice command control of via your Buds — that way you can do things like pause your music with just a couple of words. Buds 3 will start at $179.99 and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro at $249.99.",

                    "text": "Alongside the Ring are the Galaxy Z Fold6 and Galaxy Z Flip6—new versions of Samsung's folding phones that are now in their sixth generation. In the audio department, the company showed off the Galaxy Buds3 and Buds3 Pro wireless earbuds. The Galaxy Watch7 smartwatch series as usual comes in two sizes. But unusually, there's a new Galaxy Watch Ultra. It takes a lot of inspiration from the Apple Watch Ultra and, like Apple's premium wearable, it targets more serious athletes.

Learn more. The Galaxy Ring Most of us are used to tracking health and fitness data through a smartwatch or fitness tracker. Smart rings have been increasingly popular because the tech's miniaturization has improved, and who doesn't want to wear a small ring to do all this health tracking instead of a bulky watch? Samsung's Galaxy Ring, teased earlier this year at CES, is a lightweight titanium ring that comes in black, silver, and gold finishes. The company will ship out a ring-sizing kit once you place a preorder, but these rings will also be available at select retailers later this year, in which case you'll be able to try them on in the store. (I, a 6'4\" man, could fit only the maximum size 13 ring on most of my fingers, so I'm a little worried folks with thick digits might have trouble.) There are nine size options. It's IP68 and 10 ATM water resistant, so you can use it while in the shower or doing the dishes. It pairs with any Android phone through the Samsung Health app, but it won't work with iPhones. You do not need a subscription to access the full suite of features; all of the available features are included with the purchase. It also works with Samsung Find, so you can easily locate it if it's misplaced. It has a charging case that works exactly like the case for your wireless earbuds. Samsung claims the Galaxy Ring can last seven days on a single charge, matching the battery life of the Oura Ring. The ring covers many health-tracking features you'd expect from a smartwatch, including sleep tracking, cycle tracking, high or low heart rate alerts, and auto-workout detection. Samsung has talked up its use of artificial intelligence on the Ring, using smart algorithms to monitor sleep patterns, snoring, and heart and respiratory rate to help you get more robust information about your sleep. More important is a feature called Energy Score, also available in the new Galaxy Watches. Much like Fitbit's Daily Readiness or Garmin's Body Battery, it looks at your data and then recommends how ready you are to take on the day based on factors like sleep quality and your recent activity levels. You'll also get “wellness tips” throughout the day to keep you on your health goals. If you use both the Galaxy Ring and the new Galaxy Watch series simultaneously, some sensors may turn off in the watch to conserve its battery life, which is something I haven't seen before. The Ring does not provide haptic feedback, but you can perform some rudimentary gesture controls with your fingers for a few tasks, like dismissing an alarm or starting a video recording on your phone. These “Double Pinch Gestures” are also available on the Galaxy Watch7 series. The Galaxy Ring is available for preorder today and costs $400. It'll officially go on sale July 24. I'll be slipping the precious on my fingers very soon to give it a test ride. Sixth-Gen Folding Phones The new Galaxy Z Flip6 and Fold6 don't break much new ground over their predecessors. I feel like I've been saying that with every new iteration over the past six years, but it's true! Samsung tends to refine its folding Android phone designs instead of making drastic changes. Both handsets are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, just like every other flagship Android phone of 2024. The Flip6 is Samsung's thinnest yet, and the Fold6 is shorter and wider than the last one. They're both boxier—gone are the rounded curves in favor of sharp edges. Most of what's new on these folding phones are the same Galaxy AI features Samsung announced with the Galaxy S24 series. That includes Circle to Search, which can take advantage of the larger 7.6-inch screen on the Fold6. These AI features have picked up new tricks, like how Circle to Search can now provide solutions to mathematical equations (and how to solve them). One fun new addition is “Sketch to Image.” I opened a photo of seashells on the beach in Samsung's Gallery app, pressed the AI button, and drew a crude star. I tapped Generate and the phone drummed up a realistic-looking, star-shaped seashell right where I doodled. It's pretty remarkable. (These images with generated sketches will be watermarked to indicate they were made with AI.) Another to note is the real-time phone call translation feature—it's present on these phones, but now it works in any third-party calling app like WhatsApp and Telegram. Samsung is emphasizing the improved durability of these folding phones, citing improved scratch resistance and a new fourth layer in the display that protects it from punctures. There's also a “dual-rail hinge” for better shock absorption in the event of a drop. This might explain the slightly improved dust resistance—they have an IP48 rating instead of an IPX8 rating like prior models. On the Flip6, Samsung did not change the exterior screen; it's still a 3.6-inch display. This is the opposite of what Motorola did in its new Razr phones. I prefer the 4-inch external screen on the Razr+ as it offers more space to see more of an app or notification. What's new then? There are more interactive wallpapers and ones that react to real-time weather and the current amount of daylight. You will also find a wider variety of widgets on this external display, and you can customize the size of widgets and put multiple together if you like. Smart replies show up when someone messages you too—tap one of these AI-generated responses instead of opening up the handset if you can't be distracted for more than a moment. The cameras have been updated; the Flip6 has the same 50-megapixel main camera as the Galaxy S24 and an improved 12-megapixel ultrawide. The Fold6 has these two plus a 12-megapixel camera with a 3X optical zoom. There's not much else new with the cameras, except that Samsung has taken a cue from Motorola and added a feature called “Camcorder Grip” for the Flip6. Hold the phone sideways, folded at a 90-degree angle like a camcorder, and it'll start recording, offering a zoom slider on the bottom screen as you record. It's a fun feature on the Razr and I expect it to be the same here. There are two other notable changes in this flip phone. First, Samsung says it has installed the first-ever vapor chamber in a Galaxy Z Flip phone. These chambers are used on most smartphones today for better heat dissipation, allowing for smoother sustained performance when playing games. That should make the Flip6 run cooler overall. Second, it now matches the Galaxy S24's battery capacity at 4,000 mAh. Folding flip phones don't have great battery life, but every boost helps. The Fold6 and Flip6 have some improvements to the Interpreter mode, which you use when translating a conversation IRL. There's a Conversation mode and a Listening mode. The latter will let you run the mic as someone talks in another language, and you'll see their speech translated as text on the screen. Conversation mode, on the other hand, lets you have a back-and-forth with someone, showing text translations of your speech to the other person on the exterior screen, and the translation of their speech on the internal screen. Google introduced this feature on its Pixel Fold last year. The Galaxy Z Flip6 and Z Fold6 are now available for preorder and go on sale July 24. The downside? There's a $100 price bump over the last models, and it's difficult to stomach when the new phones are short on changes. The Galaxy Flip6 starts at $1,099, and the Fold6 costs $1,900. Ouch. If it's any consolation, if you ever scratch the screen protector on either of these phones, you can get a free replacement within one year from the date of purchase. If you crack the display, Samsung will offer a “reduced-free screen repair” for $200, which is way cheaper than what you'd typically shell out. Just know this latter offer expires after two years from purchase. Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Watch7 For the first time, there's a Galaxy Watch Ultra. I wonder what prompted this addition to the lineup? This is a big 47-mm Wear OS 5 smartwatch (the first to run the latest version of Wear OS) with a squircle-ish design. It looks attractive, especially with the orange band, and Samsung has a few new sporty watch faces to complete the look. It's made of titanium, has a 10 ATM water resistance, and can operate in extreme altitudes like 500 meters below sea level up to 9,000 meters of elevation. (That's 29,527 feet—taller than Mount Everest, so you can summit any peak on Earth with it.) There's a new multi-sports tile if you want to track for a triathlon, a new capability that accurately measures maximum cycling power within minutes, and an advanced personalized HR zone to ensure you're exerting the proper amount as you exercise. And then there's a list of features Samsung more or less copied from Apple. Quick Button (aka Apple's Action Button) lets you control workouts or you can map it to other functions. There's an emergency siren to activate if things are perilous, and the screen will automatically switch to Night mode (where everything is red) for the best readability in the dark. Speaking of, the screen also hits a peak brightness of 3,000 nits. A bigger watch means bigger battery life, and Samsung claims 100 hours in Power Saving mode and 48 hours in Exercise Power Saving mode. It's hard to determine what that translates to in average use, but considering the Galaxy Watch6 series typically lasts a day and a half, I expect the Ultra to last between two and three days. Brace yourself for the price: $650. The standard Watch7 comes in two sizes (40 and 44 mm) and isn't much of a visual change from its predecessor, though there are no more mechanical rotating bezels on any of these smartwatches anymore. (Boo!) These watches are powered by a 3-nanometer processor that's faster and more power efficient than the previous chips, and there's also dual-frequency GPS to better track your location. Everything available on the Watch7 is available on the Watch Ultra, and the headline feature is FDA-authorized sleep apnea tracking, which can monitor for moderate to severe signs of the condition. Many other health-tracking features are still available but purportedly made better thanks to more accurate sensors in the watches; for example, heart rate measurements during intense workouts are up to 30 percent more accurate, according to Samsung. Samsung didn't dive into details about this in my meeting, but apparently the Watch7 is also capable of tracking advanced glycation end products (AGEs) via an AGEs Index. This tool is supposed to help predict issues tied to metabolic health so you can seek preventative care if warning signs are present. The Galaxy Watch7 series starts at $300 and preorders are open now with official sales kicking off July 24. New Galaxy Buds Last but not least are the Galaxy Buds3 and Buds3 Pro—the first new Samsung wireless earbuds since 2022. Samsung says it spent 12 months collecting data to find the most comfortable fit and … well, I'm sorry to say that the answer turns out to be an AirPods clone. No, really. They look like a Cybertruck had a baby with AirPods. The Buds3 have a flat design, but the Buds3 Pro have eartips. They're both IP57-rated, so they're ready for sweaty runs. The coolest trick these earbuds have up their sleeves is real-time translation via Samsung's Interpreter mode. It's powered by a Galaxy Fold6 or Flip6, but the earbuds' mics can pick up anything said around you and translate it to your language. There's going to be a small delay for the translations to trickle into your ears, so don't expect to follow fast talkers. They have adaptive noise cancellation that can cut out blaring sirens or silence your music when someone starts talking to you, and Samsung touts the usual audio improvements, like 24-bit 96-kHz playback and enhanced call quality. The Buds3 cost $180 and the Buds3 Pro are $250. They're available for preorder now and go on sale July 24.",

                    "text": "Samsung events tend to be about as leaky as a 150-year-old faucet, so there weren't too many surprises coming out of the company's latest Unpacked. As expected, the showcase shed more light on the Galaxy Ring, Samsung's latest foldables, two new smartwatches and a couple pairs of earbuds. If you missed the livestream, you can catch up on demand. But in case you don't have time to watch it yourself, we've got all the big news for you right here. There's a lot to go through, so let's keep this preamble short and delve right into our look at everything that was announced at the July 2024 edition of Samsung Galaxy Unpacked. Galaxy Ring Kicking things off is a brand new product category for Samsung: a smart ring. The company had already made it clear that this device (much like the Oura Ring) is focused on health and wellness, and now we've got a clearer idea of how that might work, as well as how much you'll need to pay to snap up the Galaxy Ring. Samsung claims it's been able to cram its existing sensor tech into the smaller form factor of a ring. The titanium Galaxy Ring has an accelerometer, PPG sensors to measure blood flow and skin temperature detection. It can track metrics such as sleep score, movement during your slumber, heart rate, respiratory rate and menstrual cycles. Samsung will give you an overall Energy Score to help give you a snapshot of your overall health, and it will offer some suggestions on how to improve things. There's no subscription required for any of this, by the way, which is welcome news. Along with automatic workout detection, the ring can deliver heart rate alerts and nudge you to move around a little if it hasn't picked up much movement from you recently. Oh, and you can use the smart ring to remotely snap a photo with your Galaxy phone. The Galaxy Ring, which is said to run for up to seven days on a single charge and has a quick charging case, will run you $400. Pre-orders start today in the US. The wearable will start shipping on July 24. One other thing worth noting is that if you wear a Galaxy Ring and Galaxy Watch together, the battery life of the former will last for up to 30 percent longer, Samsung claims. Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6 Samsung's foldable phones are getting their annual refresh just in time to take them to the beach, perhaps to test how well those creases hold up these days. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6 are the slimmest and lightest models in their respective lineups yet, and Samsung says they're more durable than ever. The company says there's a strengthened folding edge to help support the dual-rail hinge, while \"enhanced layers\" for the main screen help improve the crease without diminishing strength. Both smartphones have Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 to help make them more durable too. The handsets run on a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset. On the cooling front, the Z Fold 6 has a larger vapor chamber than its predecessor. The Z Flip 6 is the first Z Flip to include a vapor chamber, which should improve cooling. Because it's 2024, the phones have a ton of AI features (some of which appeared in the Galaxy Ultra S24), including a fully integrated Google Gemini app. They can generate a more detailed image based on a sketch and draft emails based on a prompt, while there are a bunch of AI-powered camera upgrades. One admittedly cool feature for the Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 is that the Interpreter app makes the most of the dual screen format, so both the main and cover screens feature translations with the aim of fostering more natural conversations. The translations are handled on-device, rather than through the cloud. Speaking of the displays, those are slightly larger this year. The 7.6-inch main screen is 2.7mm wider, while the cover screen is 1mm wider. At 2,600 nits, the displays are also the brightest seen on a Galaxy Fold, matching that of the Galaxy S24. When it comes to the Z Flip 6, one of the major upgrades is a new camera system. The foldable boasts 50MP wide and 12MP ultra-wide sensors (the same as the base Galaxy S24). The former has 2x optical zoom with artificial intelligence powering a zoom function of up to 10x. Samsung has also bumped up the base memory from 8GB to 12GB. Both smartphones are available to pre-order today and general availability starts on July 24. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 starts at $1,900, while the Z Flip 6 starts at $1,100. Those who pre-order a Z Fold 6 will get a storage bump from 256GB to 512GB or 512GB to 1TB, while you can get a free 256GB to 512GB storage increase with a Galaxy Z Flip 6 pre-order. If you're interested in finding out more about the devices before taking the plunge though, you may be pleased to learn that we've had some hands-on time with them. You can read our first impressions of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 now or watch the video above. Galaxy Watch 7 and Galaxy Watch Ultra Of all the possible words Samsung could have chosen for its new premium smartwatch, it had to plump for \"Ultra.\" It's not like any of Samsung's major competitors has a smartwatch bearing that moniker or anything. Anyway, there's a new high-end Samsung smartwatch in town and it's called the Galaxy Watch Ultra. The Wear OS 5-powered device employs a new cushion design to bolster protection and what Samsung calls \"visual completeness.\" The Watch Ultra is designed for durability, perhaps with extreme athletes in mind. For one thing, it's said to work at a wider range of altitudes, from 500 meters below sea level to 9,000 meters above it. It's water resistant to a depth of 100 meters and has a titanium frame. Adventurers should not have to worry about the device running out of juice in a hurry as Samsung says it will run for up to 100 hours in power saving mode and 48 hours when exercise power saving is enabled. Either way, it should have the longest battery life of any Galaxy Watch. Other features include multi-course workout tracking (for things like triathlons), advanced Personalized Heart Rate Zone and an emergency siren to bolster safety. The screen has a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, so it should be visible in very sunny conditions, and there's a night mode too. Samsung says the Galaxy Watch Ultra can even look for signs of sleep apnea. On top of all that, there's a new programmable Quick Button. For those who just want the latest Samsung smartwatch without too many bells and whistles, there's the Galaxy Watch 7. This model is the first with a 3nm processor, which Samsung says can deliver three times faster CPU performance and 30 percent better power efficiency. It has a dual-frequency GPS system to boost location accuracy, health tracking upgrades and the ability to control the device via double pinch gestures. Hmm, where have we heard that one before? The Galaxy Watch Ultra is only available in a 47mm size and costs $650. As for the Galaxy Watch 7, that comes in 40mm and 44mm sizes. It starts at $300. It's the same deal as with all the other new gear: pre-orders are open now with shipments and general availability starting on July 24. We've also had the chance to go hands on with the Galaxy Watch Ultra, so you can read all about our first impressions of Samsung's stab at a higher-end smartwatch. Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro We have some new Galaxy Buds to go with the ring, watches and foldables. When the Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro are paired with a Z Flip 6 or Z Fold 6, the Interpreter app can translate audio live into your ears. That might be helpful for anyone studying abroad or taking a foreign language class. Both models use their mics to analyze internal and external sound to optimize audio quality and active noise cancellation. The Buds 3 Pro can automatically adjust for noise via the adaptive noise control, siren detect and voice detect features. The in-ear Buds 3 Pro have a new blade (i.e. stem) design with lights built in. You'll be able to control the audio by pinching or swiping up or down.

Apple TV+ has revealed that Severance season 2 will (finally!) premiere on Friday, January 17, 2025, nearly three years after season 1, followed by new episodes every Friday through March 21. There will be 10 episodes total. You can watch the date announcement trailer above. Here’s more: In Severance, Mark Scout leads a team at Lumon Industries, whose employees have undergone a severance procedure, which surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is called into question as Mark finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work… and of himself. In season two, Mark and his friends learn the dire consequences of trifling with the severance barrier, leading them further down a path of woe. Directed and executive produced by Ben Stiller and created, written, and executive produced by Dan Erickson, Severance stars Adam Scott, Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, Zach Cherry, Jen Tullock, Michael Chernus, Dichen Lachman, John Turturro, Christopher Walken, and Patricia Arquette.

Will Irving (John Turturro) and Burt (Christopher Walken) find a way to save their star-crossed romance? Will Mark reunite with his presumed-dead wife Gemma/Ms. Casey (Dichen Lachman)?

                    "text": "A teaser for the second season of Severance previews more tension and regret for Adam Scott, Zach Cherry, Britt Lower, and John Turturro. Although not much happens in the half-minute or so clip, it gives a sense of how Apple TV+’s pseudo-serious satire of Americans’ inability to achieve a work-life balance could continue when the series returns on Jan. 17. The clip begins with the four characters donning their company IDs as they enter the elevator, which severs their work life from their personal life. The voiceover replays them reading the contract they agreed to in the first season. “I am aware that this operation is comprehensive and irreversible,” Lower’s character says. This agreement separates people living in the outside world (“outies”) from those inside at work (“innies”). Once the doors close, the drama kicks off with motorcycle rides through hallways, Lower crawling through an air duct, and the four of them looking concerned at the camera in an empty office. The tagline for the season is “Like you never left.” In the first season, Scott’s character on both sides of the work-life balance begins to worry about himself and try to figure out the mystery of why he can’t remember anything. He ropes in the others to help him figure things out, and both worlds start to crumble. An official description of Season Two suggests the quartet “learn the dire consequences of trifling with the severance barrier, leading them further down a path of woe.” Other returning actors for the second season include Patricia Arquette, Christopher Walken, and Tramell Tillman. Sarah Bock (Bruiser) joins the cast as a regular for the season, and executive producer Ben Stiller directs five of the episodes. Series creator and executive producer Dan Erickson wrote the season.",

If the top finishers on the player ballot are already All-Stars, then MLB can select another replacement.Westburg gives the Orioles, who hold the AL's best record at 57-33, a total of four All-Star representatives. The 25-year-old is batting .282 with 15 home runs, 50 RBIs and 46 runs scored in 84 games.Another injury replacement was announced by the league Tuesday: Cincinnati Reds pitcher Hunter Greene was selected to fill the spot of Los Angeles Dodgers right-hander Tyler Glasnow, who was placed on the 15-day injured list because of back tightness.Read more: Dodgers Place Another All-Star on Injured ListGreene, 24, is 5-4 with a 3.45 ERA in 18 starts for the Reds.

                    "text": "BOSTON (AP) — Brayan Bello fanned a career-high 11 batters – getting each of his first 10 outs by strikeout – and Wilyer Abreu and Dominic Smith homered on back-to-back pitches in an eight-run second inning Tuesday night to help the Boston Red Sox beat the Oakland Athletics 12-9. On the day he was scratched from the All-Star Game with a sore shoulder, Rafael Devers had two hits and a walk, driving in three runs and scoring twice as the Red Sox won for the seventh time in eight games and improved to a season-high 10 games over .500. Bello (9-5) is the first Red Sox pitcher since at least 1961 – and the first in the majors this year – to record his first 10 outs by strikeout. Even as he struggled in the first inning, when the A’s took a 2-0 lead on three hits and a wild pitch, Bello got all three outs on K’s. Bello struck out three more (while allowing two baserunners) in the second, and then struck out the side in a 1-2-3 third inning. He fanned Lawrence Butler for the first out in the fourth, and then with runners on first and second he finally induced a groundout, by Max Schuemann. By that time, the Red Sox led 11-2. Bello was charged for three more runs in the sixth, when he gave up a pair of singles and Butler’s 457-foot homer. In all, the Red Sox right-hander allowed five runs on nine hits and two walks. Oakland scored another run in the seventh and made it 12-9 with two outs in the ninth when Zack Gelof hit a three-run homer — his third hit of the game — off of Trey Wingcenter. Wingcenter, who was making his major league debut, got Butler on a popup in the infield to end it. Joey Estes (3-4) gave up hits to the first four batters in the first, with Boston taking a 3-2 lead on Devers’ two-run single. But it was the second inning when the Red Sox chased Estes and broke things open with eight runs on seven hits, a walk and a hit batter. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, it’s the first time since 2011 that every member of a major league lineup had at least one hit and one run in the first two innings. The Red Sox last did it in 2003. Estes, who hadn’t allowed more than two runs in any of his last three starts, was charged with eight runs on seven hits and one walk in 1 2/3 innings. Alex Cora earned his 490th victory as Red Sox manager, surpassing Bill Carrigan for fourth-most in club history. It was Cora’s 900th game – more than 100 fewer than Carrigan (1,003). UP AND DOWN The Red Sox recalled utilityman Jamie Westbrook from Triple-A Worcester and selected right-hander Trey Wingenter to the roster. Utilityman Enmanuel Valdez was optioned to Worcester and righty Naoyuki Uwasawa was designated for assignment. TRAINER’S ROOM A’s: LHP Hogan Harris, whose wife is expecting their first child, was placed on the paternity list and RHP Michel Otañez was recalled from Triple-A Las Vegas to take his spot on the roster. Red Sox: Cora said Devers had a nagging shoulder injury that will benefit from rest over the four-day All-Star break. UP NEXT Game 2 of the three-game series will feature right-hander Nick Pivetta (4-5) against JP Sears (5-7). ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

                    "text": "BOSTON (AP) — Brayan Bello fanned a career-high 11 batters – getting each of his first 10 outs by strikeout – and Wilyer Abreu and Dominic Smith homered on back-to-back pitches in an eight-run second inning Tuesday night to help the Boston Red Sox beat the Oakland Athletics 12-9. On the day he was scratched from the All-Star Game with a sore shoulder, Rafael Devers had two hits and a walk, driving in three runs and scoring twice as the Red Sox won for the seventh time in eight games and improved to a season-high 10 games over .500. Bello (9-5) is the first Red Sox pitcher since at least 1961 – and the first in the majors this year – to record his first 10 outs by strikeout. Even as he struggled in the first inning, when the A’s took a 2-0 lead on three hits and a wild pitch, Bello got all three outs on K’s. Bello struck out three more (while allowing two baserunners) in the second, and then struck out the side in a 1-2-3 third inning. He fanned Lawrence Butler for the first out in the fourth, and then with runners on first and second he finally induced a groundout, by Max Schuemann. By that time, the Red Sox led 11-2. Bello was charged for three more runs in the sixth, when he gave up a pair of singles and Butler’s 457-foot homer. In all, the Red Sox right-hander allowed five runs on nine hits and two walks. Oakland scored another run in the seventh and made it 12-9 with two outs in the ninth when Zack Gelof hit a three-run homer — his third hit of the game — off of Trey Wingcenter. Wingcenter, who was making his major league debut, got Butler on a popup in the infield to end it. Joey Estes (3-4) gave up hits to the first four batters in the first, with Boston taking a 3-2 lead on Devers’ two-run single. But it was the second inning when the Red Sox chased Estes and broke things open with eight runs on seven hits, a walk and a hit batter. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, it’s the first time since 2011 that every member of a major league lineup had at least one hit and one run in the first two innings. The Red Sox last did it in 2003. Estes, who hadn’t allowed more than two runs in any of his last three starts, was charged with eight runs on seven hits and one walk in 1 2/3 innings. Alex Cora earned his 490th victory as Red Sox manager, surpassing Bill Carrigan for fourth-most in club history. It was Cora’s 900th game – more than 100 fewer than Carrigan (1,003). UP AND DOWN The Red Sox recalled utilityman Jamie Westbrook from Triple-A Worcester and selected right-hander Trey Wingenter to the roster. Utilityman Enmanuel Valdez was optioned to Worcester and righty Naoyuki Uwasawa was designated for assignment. TRAINER’S ROOM A’s: LHP Hogan Harris, whose wife is expecting their first child, was placed on the paternity list and RHP Michel Otañez was recalled from Triple-A Las Vegas to take his spot on the roster. Red Sox: Cora said Devers had a nagging shoulder injury that will benefit from rest over the four-day All-Star break. UP NEXT Game 2 of the three-game series will feature right-hander Nick Pivetta (4-5) against JP Sears (5-7).",

                    "text": "Michael Douglas has a few pointers for whomever prepped Biden for the debate, as he echoed George Clooney’s concerns as shared in a New York Times op-ed that called for Biden to step down during his Wednesday appearance on The View. “First of all, they should have just told the president to stand up, put a little makeup on for the debate and then where to look,” Douglas said as he shared his thoughts following Biden’s performance during last month’s presidential debate. Upon being asked about Clooney’s op-ed, in which he wrote that “Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024” by allowing himself to be replaced as the Democratic nominee, Douglas said, “I think it’s a valid point.” “I’m deeply, deeply concerned,” he continued. “It’s difficult because the Democrats have a big bench, they’ve got a lot of heavy hitters, a lot of talent. And I do worry with the difficulty with the debate.” Douglas also said that Biden should have been advised not to “deal with all of your facts—just deal with [Trump’s] lies.” While many in the realm of politics have shared their belief that Biden should withdraw from the race due to the mental state implicated by his debate performance and subsequent interview with George Stephanopoulos (who also expressed his doubts about the President’s abilities, though he later apologized for doing so), others in Hollywood aside from Clooney and Douglas have expressed their concerns as well. Movie director Rob Reiner took to X over the weekend to express that very thing, when he wrote “It’s time to stop fucking around” and “It’s time for Joe Biden to step down.” A week prior to his tweet, both Reiner and actress icon Jane Fonda were said to be at a debate watch party in Los Angeles, according to CNN, which reported that early on into the broadcast, Reiner expressed his worry about Biden losing the election, and Fonda had tears in her eyes. A week before the debate, Fonda told Wolf Blitzer that Biden was “just fine” and pointed out that she’s five years older than he is. Reiner had hosted a fundraiser for the incumbents. To be sure, not all celebs have turned their backs on the president. Earlier this week, Whoopi Goldberg, also on The View, vowed that she’d vote for Biden even “if he poops his pants,” despite his performance on the debate stage. But that performance still rattled many of his other otherwise loyal celebrity donors and endorsers—and only time will tell whether he can win them back. For his part, during his appearance on The View and despite expressing his concerns, Douglas did not call for Biden to step down.",

On ABC’s \"The View,\" he was asked about calls from the media and some of his fellow Democrats for Biden to abandon his re-election campaign. Douglas seemed torn, describing Biden’s political career in glowing terms, but wondered if this year’s race is too \"crucial\" to risk on him losing to former President Trump. \"This just happens to be one of these elections that is just so crucial, and it’s really hard,\" Douglas said. GEORGE CLOONEY RUBS ELBOWS WITH BIDEN AT STAR-STUDDED LA FUNDRAISER AFTER CALLING WHITE HOUSE WITH COMPLAINT Co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin asked Douglas if he agreed with fellow actor George Clooney’s new opinion piece in the New York Times calling on Biden to step aside, admitting the president had clearly declined. \"Well, I think it’s a valid point,\" Douglas replied. \"I mean, I’m deeply, deeply concerned. I mean especially, it’s difficult because the Democrats have a big bench. I mean, they’ve got a lot of heavy hitters … A lot of talent.\" The show co-hosts also asked if he agreed with other Democratic Party leaders who seem to be cooling in their support for Biden’s re-election campaign following the debate. They specifically brought up former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., whom co-host Joy Behar noted \"seems on the fence.\" CHARLAMAGNE SAYS ‘ALL I HEAR IS EGO’ FROM BIDEN, CALLS ON DEMOCRATS TO CHALLENGE HIM FOR NOMINATION AT DNC Douglas told the panel that he’s not concerned about Biden's age now, but he would be worried about it during a potential second term. \"I don’t worry necessarily today or tomorrow, but a year down the line, I worry. I am concerned,\" he said. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., told CNN on Tuesday he thought Biden could lose in a \"landslide\" to Trump. Several House Democrats have outright called on him to step aside, but Biden has repeatedly said he will continue to run. Douglas said some Democratic politicians seem to be \"going back and forth\" on whether they want to keep the president on the ticket. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We need courage.

                    "text": "Actor Michael Douglas, a longtime supporter and fundraiser for President Joe Biden, expressed during a Wednesday appearance on ABC’s The View that he was ‘deeply, deeply concerned” about the president’s cognitive health. “Do you agree for calls for him to step aside? Even Nancy Pelosi seems on the fence about him stepping aside,” co-host Joy Behar asked the actor. “Such a tough one. I adore the guy. 50 years of public service,” Douglas responded. Behar chimed in, “Lovely man.” “A wonderful guy, and this just happens to be one of these elections that is just so crucial, and it’s really hard. I don’t worry necessarily today or tomorrow but a year down the line, I worry,” Douglas added. “I am concerned. You know, and so I’d make a back and forth and looking at some of our politicians who spoke about Biden dropping out last week, and then all of a sudden this week they’re hedging their bets.” Host Alyssa Farah Griffin pressed the Hollywood star to weigh in on fellow actor George Clooney’s New York Times op-ed calling on the president to step aside. “George Clooney came out with an op-ed calling for President Biden to step aside. The stakes are too high. Would you like to respond to that?” she asked him. “I think it’s a valid point,” Douglas said. “I mean, I’m deeply, deeply concerned. I mean, especially, it’s difficult because the Democrats have a big bench. I mean, they’ve got a lot of heavy-hitters… a lot of talent.” The 79-year-old star admitted he was not impressed with Biden’s performance at the debate and worried about the president’s abilities in the long term. “I don’t worry necessarily today or tomorrow, but a year down the line, I worry. I am concerned,” he said. The longtime Democratic Party supporter admitted that politics and this election have created a divide in his own family. Douglas said he has a brother who “is on the other side of the fence on this.” “Yeah, and we finally started not being able to talk to each other. We had to take it off the table. That old story about if you take out religion and politics, you can talk to anybody,” Douglas said. In April, Douglas and his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones held a campaign fundraiser at their Westchester County home for Biden with 100 guests who paid at least $3,000 and up to $100,000 each person to attend. While at the fundraiser, according to a White House pool report, Biden became confused and forgot the date of the Jan. 6 riots. “We’ll certainly never forget the dark days of June 6, Jan. 6, excuse me,” the president reportedly said.",

                    "text": "A specialist website focused on naval activities around the world has shared an image it says shows a Russian Navy support ship docked at a Black Sea port in occupied Georgia where Moscow has vowed to establish a permanent naval base despite Tbilisi's objections. Naval News reported that the Russian Project 22870 craft shown in the satellite imagery it published on July 10 was \"observed in Ochamchire on July 4 and 5.\" It did not cite a source. There does not appear to have been any official reaction from either Russia or Georgia to the ship's alleged presence. But the appearance of a Russian Navy ship that is supporting the ongoing invasion of Ukraine at a port in Georgia's internationally recognized waters would almost certainly escalate Western concerns at Moscow's strategic and territorial ambitions in the region and could reignite tensions with Tbilisi. Russia has effectively occupied Abkhazia and the neighboring region of South Ossetia, which make up around one-fifth of Georgian territory, since a five-day war in 2008. The Georgian Dream party's government in Tbilisi has recently reestablished economic and other limited ties with Moscow despite a continued cutoff in formal diplomatic relations. Naval News said the craft had gone \"missing\" after being seen on June 28 at its home port of Novorossiisk, about 370 kilometers northwest of Ochamchire, which is in the region of Abkhazia. The Russian-backed separatists in Abkhazia announced in October 2023 that a deal had been signed to establish a Russian naval base at Ochamchire. Georgia's Foreign Ministry immediately condemned the plan as a \"blatant violation\" of Georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity. The separatists then announced in January that construction had begun on the base. Georgia is not a member of the European Union or NATO, though the military alliance calls Tbilisi one of its \"closest partners\" as it aspires for membership. Moscow has repeatedly criticized the NATO and EU membership aspirations of Georgia and other former Soviet republics, and in Georgia's case has kept Russian troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In November 2023, dozens of Georgian lawmakers appealed in a public statement to NATO and the European Union for condemnation of Russia's \"occupation, militarization, and other actions aimed at annexation of the occupied regions of Georgia.\" Tbilisi's candidacy for EU membership has been stalled by the recent passage of so-called \"foreign agent\" legislation seemingly modeled on laws used by Russian authorities to silence dissent and civil society. The U.S. military last week postponed \"indefinitely\" military exercises planned with Georgia for July 25-August 6 over what it said were \"false accusations\" leveled against the United States by Tbilisi. In the wake of the passage of the \"foreign agent\" legislation, U.S. officials said they were conducting a comprehensive review of Washington’s relations with Georgia.",

Brooklyn resident Salimdzhon Nasriddinov, 53, and Canadian national Nikolay Goltsev, 38, both pleaded guilty in a federal court in Brooklyn on Tuesday to conspiracy to commit export control violations for their roles in a global procurement scheme on behalf of sanctioned Russian companies, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York. “The defendants flouted U.S. law to help Russia in its war against Ukraine, but they were stopped in their tracks and swiftly brought to justice,” said Breon Peace, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Among the sanctioned companies that received some of the 300 shipments of restricted electronics—worth over $7 million—were companies with Russian military contracts. Some of the electronic components shipped by the defendants were found in seized Russian weapons platforms and signals intelligence equipment in Ukraine, per the Justice Department. The defendants each face up to 20 years in prison and a maximum supervised release term of 3 years, and a forfeiture money judgment of $4 million, per the plea agreement for Mr. Nasriddinov, which was identical to the one for Mr. Goltsev. “The defendants shipped millions of dollars’ worth of electronic components to Russia, including the exact type of parts found in Russian weapons and drones used to attack Ukraine,” Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen said in a statement. “We know the devastation and destruction that these weapons cause and the Justice Department is committed to holding accountable those who violate U.S. laws to supply the Russian war machine.” In February 2024, a third co-defendant, Kristina Puzyreva, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder the proceeds of the export scheme. She is currently awaiting sentencing. The Justice Department said that the defendants used two Brooklyn companies, SH Brothers Inc. and SN Electronics Inc., to illegally procure and ship millions of dollars worth of dual-use electronics from U.S. manufacturers, which were critical to Russia’s precision-guided weapons systems, including ones used to attack Ukraine. The defendants rerouted the components through intermediary companies in countries like Turkey, Hong Kong, India, China, and the UAE, before the parts reached Russia. The Justice Department said the defendants knew the military applications of these electronics. For instance, in November 2022, they discussed a detained shipment at JFK Airport, highlighting the scrutiny due to Ukraine’s allegations of being bombed with U.S.-sourced parts. Accordingly, they planned to diversify their shipping methods to avoid detection, per the Justice Department, which cited messages exchanged between the two defendants that were obtained by investigators. The actions that led to the defendants’ arrest were coordinated by the Justice and Commerce Departments’ Disruptive Technology Strike Force and the Justice Department’s Task Force KleptoCapture, which target illicit actors and seek to prevent critical technology acquisition by hostile states.",

                    "text": "Elon Musk won the dismissal of a lawsuit claiming he refused to pay at least $500 million of severance to thousands of Twitter employees he fired in mass layoffs after buying the social media company now known as X. U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson in San Francisco ruled on Tuesday that the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act governing benefit plans did not cover the former employees’ claims, and therefore she lacked jurisdiction. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment today. Musk’s lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests. The case is one of many accusing Musk of reneging on promises to former Twitter employees, including former Chief Executive Parag Agrawal, and vendors after buying the company for $44 billion in October 2022. Musk also runs the electric car company Tesla, and is the world’s richest person, according to Forbes magazine. According to the complaint, Twitter’s 2019 severance plan called for employees who stayed on after the buyout to receive two or six months of pay, plus one week of pay for each year of employment, if they were laid off. The plaintiffs Courtney McMillian, who oversaw Twitter’s compensation and benefits, and Ronald Cooper, an operations manager, said Twitter instead offered fired employees just one month of pay as severance, with no benefits. Thompson said ERISA didn’t apply to Twitter’s post-buyout plan because there was no “ongoing administrative scheme” where the company reviewed claims case-by-case, or offered benefits such as continued health insurance and out placement services. “There were only cash payments promised,” she wrote. The judge said the plaintiffs can try amending their complaint, but only for claims not governed by ERISA. The case is McMillian et al v. Musk et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 23-03461.",

                    "text": "A federal judge yesterday granted Elon Musk's motion to dismiss a class-action complaint alleging that laid-off Twitter employees were wrongfully denied the severance they were entitled to under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The employees may be able to latch onto another lawsuit against Twitter that alleges different severance-related violations, but their claim under ERISA was denied by US District Judge Trina Thompson in the Northern District of California. \"Plaintiffs are not without recourse,\" Thompson wrote, noting that they may benefit from similar cases ongoing against the Musk-owned firm. \"Indeed, there are other cases brought against Twitter for the failure to pay wages or provide employee severance benefits during the same or overlapping period that Plaintiffs allege Defendants denied them and the putative class sufficient severance benefits under the severance plan at issue here.\" The putative class action that was denied yesterday was filed last year by former Twitter employees Courtney McMillian and Ronald Cooper, who were offered one month of severance pay. They claim that the \"severance Twitter has offered to date is a fraction of what employees are entitled to as Plan participants,\" and they wanted to represent a class defined as all participants in the severance plan who were terminated from Twitter after Musk bought the company in October 2022. They alleged that \"terminated employees remain entitled to no less than $500 million.\" That would be the total amount allegedly due to thousands of ex-employees laid off after the Musk buyout. Twitter, now X Corp., claimed that the company did not maintain a severance plan governed by ERISA. Plaintiffs claimed that for several years before the Musk takeover, there was a \"formalized policy\" and pointed to \"documents that provide a uniform and detailed policy framework for the numerous post-termination benefits Twitter provided to employees.\" Plaintiffs said employees were promised severance based on the reason of departure, length of tenure, job level, department, issuance of stock units, and other factors. No discretion To be governed by ERISA, a severance plan must be an \"ongoing administrative program for processing claims and paying benefits.\" The Twitter plan doesn't qualify, Thompson wrote in an order granting Musk's motion to dismiss. A severance plan with a single lump sum payment can be governed by ERISA under certain conditions, Thompson wrote. Under a precedent cited by plaintiffs, a severance plan can be covered by ERISA if lump-sum payments are based on a discretionary analysis performed on a case-by-case basis. \"Here, by contrast, Twitter paid and offered to pay severance payments based on basic employment criteria that involved mathematical calculations, which does not involve a 'case-by-case' analysis or 'discretionary application' of the Twitter severance benefits' terms,\" Thompson wrote. \"Twitter's payments were 'fixed, due at known times, and [did] not depend on contingencies outside the employee's control.'\" Thompson found that the relevant severance plan is the one applied after the Musk takeover. She wrote that \"the operative complaint's facts do not show that there was any discretion required in determining which employees were eligible because all employees qualified for the severance plan upon termination due to the acquisition and subsequent merger.\" There was also no discretion in bonuses for laid-off employees \"because there was a formula for calculating severance payments that staff could apply before issuing payment.\" Thompson dismissed the ERISA claims and said that any attempt to amend those claims \"would be futile.\" Other severance lawsuits still alive Plaintiffs can file an amended complaint but only for non-ERISA claims, such as breach of contract or promissory estoppel. An amended complaint may \"state claims based on the deficient severance benefits offered or provided to terminated employees pursuant to the severance plan that applied due to the 2022 and 2023 mass layoffs,\" Thompson wrote. If plaintiffs go that route, \"this Court will consider issuing an Order finding this case related to one of the cases currently pending, such as Cornet,\" Thompson wrote. If the case is found to be related to Cornet, it could be transferred to the District of Delaware, where Cornet is being heard. The Cornet v. Twitter lawsuit alleges violations of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. The lawsuit says that Twitter did not give all employees the required 60 days' advance written notice before layoffs and that Twitter did not give payments in lieu of the notice. Both cases concern Twitter's allegedly \"deficient severance payments following mass layoffs in November 2022, December 2022, February 2023, and September 2023,\" Thompson noted. In addition to alleged WARN Act violations, the Cornet suit claims that Twitter violated promises made during the months before Musk completed the acquisition. As Thompson wrote, the \"Cornet plaintiffs assert contract-based claims for severance benefits on behalf of a nationwide putative class of X Corp employees and former employees that had been promised that 'if there were layoffs, employees would receive benefits and severance at least as favorable as the benefits and severance that Twitter previously provided to employees.'\" In September 2023, Musk's X Corp. agreed to settlement talks on arbitration claims from about 2,000 employees laid off after the sale. However, the talks didn't end in a deal, and the severance lawsuits continue.",

                    "text": "Elon Musk has won the dismissal of a lawsuit alleging he refused to dole out at least $500 million in severance payments to thousands of employees he fired after buying Twitter in 2022. The lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in California in July 2023, claimed that about 6,000 laid off employees were owed severance under provisions in the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). But U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson ruled Tuesday that the law doesn’t apply to this case and that it is out of her jurisdiction. The lawsuit is one of several cases filed against Twitter, now renamed X, and Musk by former employees. Several top executives, including former CFO Ned Segal and former CEO Parag Agrawal, sued in March, saying they are owed more than $128 million in severance payments. Former Chief Accounting Officer Robert Kaiden filed a lawsuit last month accusing Musk of failing to pay more than $3.75 million in severance. The lawsuit thrown out Tuesday was filed by Courtney McMillian, who oversaw compensation and benefits for Twitter, and Ronald Cooper, an operations manager. Twitter’s severance plan was supposed to include, “at minimum,” two months base salary, performance bonuses, and other benefits, according to the complaint.But the plaintiffs said Twitter offered fired employees just one month of pay as severance, with no benefits. Thompson wrote that ERISA could not apply to this case because there was no “ongoing administrative scheme,” noting that the company told workers that any workers let go would only receive cash payments. The judge said employees fired in Twitter’s mass layoffs in 2022 and 2023 can amend the complaint based on claims that are not covered by ERISA.",

                    "text": "A US court on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit claiming Elon Musk refused to pay at least $500m in severance to thousands of Twitter employees he fired in mass layoffs after buying the social media company now known as X. US district judge Trina Thompson in San Francisco ruled on Tuesday that the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (Erisa) governing benefit plans did not cover the former employees’ claims, and therefore she lacked jurisdiction. The decision marks a legal victory for Musk, who still faces numerous lawsuits over his business practices at companies including X, Tesla and SpaceX. The cases range from allegations of gender discrimination and defamation to engaging in retaliatory firings. The case is one of many accusing Musk of reneging on promises to former Twitter employees, including the chief executive Parag Agrawal, and vendors after he bought the company for $44bn in October 2022. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. Musk’s lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests. Musk, one of the richest people in the world, was accused of failing to pay Twitter employees appropriate severance after claiming to have fired about 80% of the company in the months after his takeover. Plaintiffs alleged employees received only one month of severance pay with no benefits, instead of the far more generous package they were entitled to as part of a 2019 severance plan. Thompson said Erisa did not apply to Twitter’s post-buyout plan because there was no “ongoing administrative scheme” in which the company reviewed claims on a case-by-case basis, or offered benefits such as continued health insurance and outplacement services. “There were only cash payments promised,” she wrote. The judge said the plaintiffs could try amending their complaint, but only for claims not governed by Erisa. Musk’s lawyers were also in court this week for the latest legal battle over his contested multibillion-dollar pay package as CEO of Tesla. A judge must rule whether lawyers who successfully argued for the court to invalidate Musk’s payment should be awarded $7bn in legal fees, a sum that would be the largest of its kind in the history of US courts.

                    "title": "Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs. OnePlus Open: Which foldable phone should you buy?",
                    "text": "It's year six for Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold, but unlike previous years, the foldable landscape has become much more competitive. At the company's Unpacked event today in Paris, it unveiled the Galaxy Z Fold 6, with notable upgrades to its design, software features, and durability. Also: Everything announced at Samsung Unpacked July 2024 I went hands-on with the Z Fold 6 ahead of Unpacked and found it to be Samsung's most refined model to date, with a slimmer and lighter form factor that reminded me of the OnePlus Open, a late bloomer phone from last year that ended up stealing the foldable crown from Samsung. So, with the two devices at the top of the class, here's a breakdown of the key reasons why you should buy one over the other. Specifications You should buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 if... 1. You want a foldable that thrives in the AI age The big feature push with the new Galaxy Z Fold 6 is AI -- specifically, how you can interact with the larger screen to research information, generate images, and better communicate with your friends and family. Tools like Interpreter Mode, which displays live translations on both the inner and outer screen when you're conversing with another person, and Sketch to Image, which turns your doodles into polished graphics, are not yet available on the OnePlus Open. Also: I went hands-on with Samsung's $1,900 Galaxy Z Fold 6, and it still feels like a dream With Samsung's commitment to seven years of software updates and security patches, you can expect the Z Fold 6 to stay feature-relevant until at least 2031. That's compared to OnePlus' commitment to four years of software updates. 2. You want the most durable foldable (and better repair support) Besides having an upper hand with an official IP48 rating for water and dust resistance, the Galaxy Z Fold 6, on paper, is built more durably than the OnePlus Open. Some new improvements include a Dual Rail hinge that helps with shock distribution, a folding edge for enhanced resistance to pressure and sharp objects, more durable outer materials like armor aluminum and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and more. Perhaps more importantly, Samsung offers better after-market support than OnePlus, with repair availability across various retailers and stores nationwide. 3. You plan to accessorize your phone Whether you're picking up a case or S Pen stylus for sketching on the phone, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 launches with a wider variety of accessories -- both first- and third-party ones -- than the OnePlus Open. Notably, Samsung itself has created several high-quality cases for the Galaxy Z Fold 6, including a Slim S Pen Cover and a faux leather option. You should buy the OnePlus Open if... 1. You want a specced-out foldable for less money If we're playing the numbers game, the OnePlus Open offers a much better value for the money than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6. It certainly helps that Samsung raised the price of its foldable by $100 this year, making it a $200 difference between the competing devices. Also: 3 reasons why I ditched my Samsung Galaxy foldable for the OnePlus Open But that's only if we compare the retail prices. With the OnePlus Open now being several months old, I've seen it go down to as low as $1,399 during major sales events. If you shop for a used model, you'll likely find it for even less. Those couple of hundred dollars can be spent on new earbuds or smartwatches or saved for later. 2. You value the OnePlus fix-ins (faster charging, multitasking, etc.) Both reasons number one and two are equally as compelling for potential buyers because the OnePlus Open has several game-changing features unique to the brand, such as 65W SuperVooc charging, which gives the phone a healthy amount of battery within minutes of charging, and Open Canvas, which lets you quickly tap between floating windows for seamless multitasking. Since using Open Canvas, I've found traditional split-screen multitasking cumbersome and clunky. I attribute the fluidity of the Open to its 16GB of RAM configuration, which is slightly more than Samsung's 12GB. You also get a base storage of 512GB, double that of the Galaxy Z Fold 6's 256GB. Again, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 costs $200 more to start. Alternatives to consider",

                    "text": "Samsung Unpacked just opened the doors to a slew of new and exciting tech, including two new wearable devices. The event also showcased the latest flagship foldable Samsung smartphones, like the Samsung Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6. Meant to work like an old-school flip phone with a modern AI-powered twist, the new Z Flip 6 isn't your dad's old Motorola Razr -- heck, even the Razr isn't your parents' old flip phone. Also: Everything announced at Samsung Unpacked July 2024: Galaxy Z Fold 6, Watch Ultra, Smart Ring, more If you want to dive back into the flip phone universe or upgrade from an older device, you may consider both the Z Flip 6 and the previous generation, the Z Flip 5. Since Samsung is giving us a largely iterative update, you may not need the latest device and could probably afford to save some cash and go for the Z Flip 5, but both models have their advantages. Let's explore how they square up. Specifications You should buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 if... 1. You want a better camera The Galaxy Z Flip 6 may be an iterative upgrade, but the camera takes a big leap forward from the previous model's 12MP main camera to a 50MP one. The new 50MP wide-angle camera supports 2x optical zoom and AI-powered zoom with up to 10x. The FlexCam is also getting an update with new creative features like Auto Zoom, which automatically adjusts the image framing by detecting the subject and zooming in and out to find the best framing option. 2. You want to dive into more AI features Galaxy AI is fully integrated into the new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, with new features coming to the FlexWindow and an AI-forward Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor. While the 3.4-inch FlexWindow offers new widgets and notification options, it also gives users access to new Galaxy AI features without opening the Z Flip 6. Users can quickly reply to texts with suggested replies, which use AI to analyze the context of the text conversation and give accurate suggestions. Also: The best foldable phones (and how they compare) The Flip 6 also features an AI-powered wallpaper option that changes in real-time. The Photo Ambient feature changes the wallpaper depending on the time and weather and can even analyze your wallpaper to suggest where to place the clock and change the frame color. 3. You're a bit clumsy If you're looking to get a new flip phone and are choosing between the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Flip 5, there's one less obvious feature you should consider, especially if you're a bit clumsy, like I am. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6 are the first foldable phones to get a formal dustproofing score. Though most flagship devices boast an IP68 rating for water resistance and dustproofing, older Samsung foldables have an IPX8 rating. The Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6 now have an IP48 rating, which means they can resist dust particles larger than 1mm in size. This may not sound like a big deal, but other foldables on the market, including the latest Motorola Razr Plus (2024), OnePlus Open, Google Pixel Fold, and previous Samsung foldables have an IPX8 rating or lower. IPX8 indicates that devices can resist continuous water immersion of up to 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes. Foldable smartphones aren't as dust-tight and water-resistant as flagship Samsung S24 devices or iPhones because they've got more hinges and small crevices that can hold particles. You should buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 if... 1. You want to wait for a bigger upgrade Samsung has only made a few upgrades to its flip phone this time after making some big advancements to performance and the hinge with the Flip 4 and Flip 5. The Z Flip 5's Flex Hinge gave the device the more solid feel of a smartphone unit rather than a device split in two halves, one of the biggest problems with foldables. The hinge also made the device thinner when folded and it was a quieter mechanism than in previous versions. Also: Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 review: Three features I love Waiting for a bigger upgrade also means you could get the Galaxy Z Flip 5 for a discounted price. It's already $100 cheaper than the Z Flip 6, starting at $1000 at its full price, but the launch of a new model is sure to drive that cost down, though you can already get up to $500 in trade-in credit. 2. You want a specific (discontinued) color Though Samsung is releasing the Z Flip 6 in six colors, including new Peach and White options, it's also discontinuing the Lavender and Green colors we saw with the Z Flip 5. While color isn't a big deal to many smartphone users, it can be more important for foldable fans, who mostly see the device's exterior when the phone is closed. If you're not excited about the new colors and prefer the Lavender or Green options, it's probably best to stick with the Galaxy Z Flip 5. Alternatives to consider",

                    "title": "Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 vs. Motorola Razr+ (2024): Which phone should you buy?",
                    "text": "Samsung today unveiled the Galaxy Z Flip 6 during its Unpacked event in Paris, touting a more durable and thinner design, new software features, and an improved camera system, among other things. Also: Everything announced at Samsung Unpacked July 2024 I went hands-on with the Z Flip 6 ahead of Unpacked and found it to be Samsung's best flip phone yet, with a bigger battery and some fancy outer-screen tricks that had me fidgeting with the devices for hours. So, how does the device compare to its biggest competitor, the Motorola Razr+ (2024)? While our hands-on time with the Galaxy Z Flip 6 remains limited, there are some notable differences already worth pointing out, as listed below. Specifications You should buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 if... 1. You want a more customizable flip phone Both Samsung and Motorola say that the main reason people are flocking to their flip phones is because of the customization aspect, with the ability to personalize the outer wallpaper, stylize with fun and quirky cases, and more. Influencers and content creators are also embracing the ability to take hands-free selfies thanks to the foldable nature of these devices. Also: I went hands-on with Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6, and it's basically a high-tech fidget spinner That's to say, while both models offer more customization settings than your typical slab phone, Samsung wins out thanks to its abundance of color options, new Interactive Wallpapers feature (which basically turns the phone into the most advanced fidget toy ever), and thoughtful cases. Specifically, the new FlipSuit cases use NFC and wireless charging that makes them light up whenever you unfold and fold the phone. 2. You want an ultrawide camera for group selfies and landscape shots While Motorola opted for a 50MP telephoto lens with the Razr+ this year, Samsung's stuck with a 50MP ultrawide, making it more practical for taking group photos and landscapes -- when you want to capture a wider and taller area. Historically, Samsung's photo processing has performed better than Motorola's, too, so you can expect better-quality shots both from the main and ultrawide lenses. 3. You'll be taking lots of photos/downloading plenty of apps Or perhaps you just want the peace of mind of having ample storage on your phone. Samsung offers a 512GB configuration for the Galaxy Z Flip 6, while Motorola doesn't -- the Razr is capped at 256GB. So, if you typically don't rely on the cloud for storing photos, files, and other data and maybe even find yourself struggling to manage 256GB of space, you'll do much better with the Samsung. The upgrade comes at a cost, of course. You should buy the Motorola Razr+ (2024) if... 1. You want a larger outer screen While Samsung has the more customizable outer screen, Motorola wins when it comes to display size, with a four-inch OLED panel that refreshes at 120Hz. Does the difference make a big difference? Not significantly, but aesthetically speaking, the Razr+ (2024) looks much more futuristic than the Galaxy Z Flip 6. You can also run any app or service you want on the outer screen, so the extra real estate comes in handy regarding viewability. Also: I tested Motorola's new Razr Plus (2024) and it made the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip feel outdated Managing the outer screen and phone when folded is also easy thanks to Motorola's stylish back covers, which include vegan leather and vegan suede finishes. There's also a \"Hot Pink\" option for those who miss the old-school Razr. 2. You want a more affordable flip phone Technically, you'll get an even better deal out of Motorola's non-Plus Razr model this year, which retails for $699, but even the Razr+ (2024) can be had right now for $899 ($100 off retail). That's compared to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, which sells for $1,099. Motorola's connections with major retailers and carriers also put it on near equal footing with Samsung when it comes to exclusive offers and discounts for customers, so you may find just as good of a deal for the Razr+ as the Galaxy Z Flip.

                    "text": "Now that Samsung has unveiled the new Z Flip 6 at its Galaxy Unpacked event, we can formally compare the other clamshell foldable that launched last month, the Motorola Razr Plus 2024. While we've formally reviewed the latter and only just seen the former, we can still compare specs and show how the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 vs. Motorola Razr Plus 2024 showdown shakes out on paper. The rivalry between these two foldables goes back to when the first versions of the Razr and Z Flip launched in 2020, and they've come a long way since, releasing various versions with bigger cover screens until today, when both have exterior displays that cover nearly the whole front cover of either phone. Unlike book-style foldables, these two clamshell foldables unfold to a traditional smartphone size and close up to have half the footprint, making them easier to slip into a pocket or bag -- and the Galaxy Z Flip and 6 Razr Plus 2024 are the best versions of these phones yet, though with several differences. For some, price is the most important issue, and Samsung chose to make its foldables $100 more expensive this year. The Z Flip 6 has a launch price of $1,100, while the Razr Plus remains at $1,000. Otherwise, the biggest difference is in the external screen, visible when the clamshell is folded closed. Technically, the Razr Plus 2024's 4-inch cover display is larger, though it extends around the two outer camera lenses; the Z Flip 6's 3.4-inch screen simply has a cutout for its outer cameras, so size is a bit of a wash. But the Razr Plus's screen is superior in its HD (1,272 x 1,080 pixel) resolution with maximum 165Hz refresh rate for a likely sharper and smoother picture compared to the Z Flip 6's 720p (720 x 748 pixel) resolution and 60Hz maximum refresh rate. When unfolded flat, both phones have roughly similar inner displays, with the Z Flip 6 sporting a 6.7-inch AMOLED screen (2,640 x 1,080 pixel) with up to 120Hz refresh rate and the Razr Plus packing a 6.9-inch pOLED (2,630 x 1,080 pixel) screen with up to 165Hz refresh rate. With that slightly larger screen, the Razr Plus is slightly longer and wider than the Z Flip 6, though it has the same thickness. Cameras are another area where the foldables differ. While both have a 50-megapixel main camera, the Z Flip 6 opts for a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera for its second rear shooter, while the Razr Plus opted for a 50-megapixel 2x telephoto camera -- a switch Motorola told CNET Managing Editor Patrick Holland was made because users were taking more zoom shots than ultrawide ones. While that makes the Razr Plus a bit less useful for group shots when taking selfies while folded closed, it could be more useful in the phone's overall kit. When the phones are unfolded, the Z Flip 6 has a 10-megapixel selfie camera above its inner display while the Razr Plus has a 32-megapixel one. Both foldables have slightly different hardware, too. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 has the most powerful of Qualcomm's mobile chips with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, while the Razr Plus 2024 has the slightly less powerful Snapdragon 8S Gen 3, which Holland found came in behind last year's Galaxy Z Flip 4 (and its Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset) in benchmarks, though he didn't notice any performance slowdown. Both phones have 12GB of RAM and the Razr Plus only comes in one configuration of 256GB of storage, while the Z Flip 6 has both 256Gb and 512GB options For software, both phones run Android 14 out of the box, and the Galaxy Z Flip 6 gets seven years of updates. That's far more, and closer to the industry standard with Google pledging the same, than the Razr Plus, which only gets three years of Android and four years of security updates. Lastly, but not least for some buyers, the phones also differ in colors offered. The Z Flip 6 comes in yellow, a light green mint, dark gray silver shadow and a powdery blue in retail stores, though you can also get it in crafted black, peach and white if buying online at Samsung.com. The Razr Plus comes in four vibrant hues: the iconic hot pink, light green, dark blue and a yellow-ish peach fuzz. That's the rundown on the differences between these two clamshell foldable titans -- here's the full list of specs for folks to compare",

                    "text": "Ellen DeGeneres doesn’t have encouraging news for fans who hoped to be seeing more of her after upcoming Netflix special. While speaking at a Q&A following a stand-up show at the Luther Burbanks Center for the Arts in Santa Rosa, California, last week, the comedian told the crowd not to expect much of her after the current tour. “This is the last time you’re going to see me,” DeGeneres said, according to SFGate.com. “After my Netflix special, I’m done.” She ended her long-running talkshow “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” two years ago following a controversy that alleged she fostered a toxic environment for her staff. “Let me catch you up on what’s been going on with me since you last saw me,” DeGeneres said. “I got chickens. Oh yeah, and I got kicked out of show business for being mean.” The comic continued, “I used to say, ‘I don’t care what people say about me.’ Now, I realize I said that during the height of my popularity.” However, DeGeneres remained adamant that she isn’t actually cruel, saying, “I can be demanding and impatient and tough. I am a strong woman … I am many things, but I am not mean.” The “Finding Dory” star issued an apology to her staff via memo in July 2020. The accusations came from former employees and one, at the time, current staffer. “On Day 1 of our show, I told everyone in our first meeting that ‘The Ellen DeGeneres Show’ would be a place of happiness — no one would ever raise their voice, and everyone would be treated with respect. Obviously, something changed, and I am disappointed to learn that this has not been the case. And for that, I am sorry,” DeGeneres wrote in the letter. “Anyone who knows me knows it’s the opposite of what I believe and what I hoped for our show.” DeGeneres previously confirmed her upcoming Netflix special would be her last. “To answer the questions everyone is asking me — Yes, I’m going to talk about it,” she said in the May announcement. “Yes, this is my last special. Yes, Portia [de Rossi] really is that pretty in real life.”",

                    "text": "Ellen DeGeneres is ready to walk away from show business. The comedian, 66, said that she’s “done” with being in the public eye after her Netflix stand-up special comes out later this year. DeGeneres made the declaration at her comedy show in Santa Rosa, Calif., on July 1. “This is the last time you’re going to see me. After my Netflix special, I’m done,” she said, according to SFGate. When a fan asked DeGeneres if she’ll voice Dory again from “Finding Nemo” and “Finding Dory,” she replied, “No, I’m going bye-bye, remember.” DeGeneres is currently on her “Ellen’s Last Stand…Up” tour. She recently canceled four shows with no explanation. Before the tour, DeGeneres stayed under the radar after her eponymous talk show ended with Season 19 in May 2022 following toxic workplace claims. In 2020, current and former staffers spoke anonymously about their alleged experience on set of the talk show for a BuzzFeed News report. She apologized to staff at the time and producers Ed Glavin, Kevin Leman and Jonathan Norman exited the show. “As we’ve grown exponentially, I’ve not been able to stay on top of everything and relied on others to do their jobs as they knew I’d want them done. Clearly some didn’t,” she wrote at the time in a memo, per the Hollywood Reporter. “That will now change and I’m committed to ensuring this does not happen again.” DeGeneres reportedly addressed the controversy at her July 1 stand-up show. “I got kicked out of show business for being mean,” she told the crowd, per SFGate. “I can be demanding and impatient and tough. I am a strong woman. I am many things, but I am not mean,” she added. The Emmy winner went on, “I used to say, ‘I don’t care what people say about me.’ Now I realize I said that during the height of my popularity.” DeGeneres previously spoke about the accusations against her while performing in West Hollywood in April. “The hate went on for a long time and I would try to avoid looking at the news. The ‘be kind’ girl wasn’t kind. That was the headline,’ ” she said to fans at the Largo. She also joked that she became the “most hated person in America.” Two weeks before “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” aired its final episode, the former Oscars host told The Hollywood Reporter that her decision to end the show had nothing to do with behind-the-scenes controversy. “When you’re a creative person, you constantly need to be challenged – and as great as this show is, and as fun as it is, it’s just not a challenge anymore,” she insisted. DeGeneres’ upcoming Netflix special was announced in May. “To answer the questions everyone is asking me — Yes, I’m going to talk about it. Yes this is my last special,” the comedian said in a press release.",

                    "text": "LIMA, Peru—Twenty two years ago, an avalanche buried American climber Bill Stampfl as he made his way up one of the highest peaks in the Andes mountains. His family knew there was little hope of finding him alive, or even of retrieving his corpse from the thick fields of snow and the freezing ice sheets that cover the 6,700-meter (22,000-foot) tall Huascaran peak. But in June, Stampfl’s son got a call from a stranger, who said he had come across the climber’s frozen, and mostly intact body, as he made his own ascent up Huascaran. “It was so out of left field. We talk about my dad, we think about him all the time,” Joseph Stampfl said. “You just never think you are going to get that call.” He then shared the news with his family. “It’s been a shock” said Jennifer Stampfl, the climber’s daughter. “When you get that phone call that he’s been found your heart just sinks. You don’t know how exactly to feel at first.” On Tuesday, police in Peru said they had recovered Stampfl’s body from the mountain where he was buried by the avalanche in 2002, when the 58-year-old was climbing with two friends who were also killed. A group of policemen and mountain guides put Stampfl’s body on a stretcher, covered it in an orange tarp, and slowly took it down the icy mountain. The body was found at an altitude of 5,200 meters (17,060 feet), about a nine-hour hike from one of the camps where climbers stop when they tackle Huascaran’s steep summit. Jennifer Stampfl said the family plans to move the body to a funeral home in Peru’s capital, Lima, where it can be cremated and his ashes repatriated. “For 22 years, we just kind of put in our mind: ’This is the way it is. Dad’s part of the mountain, and he’s never coming home,'” she said. Police said Stampfl’s body and clothing were preserved by the ice and freezing temperatures. His driver’s license was found inside a hip pouch. It says he was a resident of Chino in California’s San Bernardino County. The effort to retrieve Stampfl’s remains began last week, after an American climber came upon the frozen body while making his way to the Huascaran summit. The climber opened the pouch and read the name on the driver’s license. He called Stampfl’s relatives, who then got in touch with local mountain guides. Joseph Stampfl said they worked with a Peruvian mountain rescue association to retrieve his father’s body, which was about 915 to 1,200 meters (3,000 to 4,000 feet) below where he and his two friends were believed to have been killed. “He was no longer encased in ice,” the son said. “He still has got his boots on.” A team of 13 mountaineers participated in the recovery operation—five officers from an elite police unit and eight mountain guides who work for Grupo Alpamayo, a local tour operator that takes climbers to Huascaran and other peaks in the Andes. Eric Raul Albino, director of Grupo Alpamayo, said he was hired by Stampfl’s family to retrieve the body. Lenin Alvardo, one of the police officers who participated in the recovery operation, said Stampfl’s clothes were still mostly intact. The hip pouch with his driving license also contained a pair of sunglasses, a camera, a voice recorder and two decomposing $20 bills. A gold wedding ring was still on the left hand. “I’ve never seen anything like that” Alvarado said. Huascaran is Peru’s highest peak. Hundreds of climbers visit the mountain each year with local guides, and it typically takes them about a week to reach the summit. Stampfl was with friends Matthew Richardson and Steve Erskine in trying to climb Huascaran in 2002. They had travelled the world to climb challenging mountains and had reached the peaks of Kilimanjaro, Rainier, Shasta and Denali, according to a Los Angeles Times report at the time. Erskine’s body was found shortly after the avalanche, but Richardson’s corpse is still missing. Ms. Jennifer Stampfl said a plaque in memory of the three friends was placed at the summit of Mount Baldy in Southern California, where the trio trained for their expeditions. She said they may return to the site with her father’s remains. Janet Stampfl-Raymer, who was Stampfl’s wife, said that when her husband wasn’t working as a civil engineer, he loved to be a mountaineer. “He was a kind man. He was humble. He loved God, and he loved the mountains,” she said. “We all just dearly loved my husband. He was one of a kind,” she said. “We’re very grateful we can bring his body home to rest.” Stampfl carefully planned his mountaineering expeditions, his daughter said. She also said he was very humble and did not like to draw attention to himself. “The fact that he is in the news, it is so not my dad,” she said.",

Hundreds of climbers visit the mountain each year with local guides, and it typically takes them about a week to reach the summit. However, climate change has affected Huascaran and the surrounding peaks higher than 5,000 meters, known as the Cordillera Blanca.

You don’t know how exactly to feel at first.” On Tuesday, police in Peru said they had recovered Stampfl’s body from the mountain where he was buried by the avalanche in 2002, when the 58-year-old was climbing with two friends who were also killed. A group of policemen and mountain guides put Stampfl’s body on a stretcher, covered it in an orange tarp, and slowly took it down the icy mountain. The body was found at an altitude of 17,060 feet, about a nine-hour hike from one of the camps where climbers stop when they tackle Huascaran’s steep summit. Jennifer Stampfl said the family plans to move the body to a funeral home in Peru’s capital, Lima, where it can be cremated and his ashes repatriated. “For 22 years, we just kind of put in our mind: ’This is the way it is. Dad’s part of the mountain, and he’s never coming home,'” she said. Police said Stampfl’s body and clothing were preserved by the ice and freezing temperatures. His driver’s license was found inside a hip pouch. It says he was a resident of Chino in California’s San Bernardino County. The effort to retrieve Stampfl’s remains began last week, after an American climber came upon the frozen body while making his way to the Huascaran summit. The climber opened the pouch and read the name on the driver’s license. He called Stampfl’s relatives, who then got in touch with local mountain guides. Joseph Stampfl said they worked with a Peruvian mountain rescue association to retrieve his father’s body, which was about 3,000 to 4,000 feet below where he and his two friends were believed to have been killed. “He was no longer encased in ice,” the son said. “He still has got his boots on.” A team of 13 mountaineers participated in the recovery operation — five officers from an elite police unit and eight mountain guides who work for Grupo Alpamayo, a local tour operator that takes climbers to Huascaran and other peaks in the Andes. Eric Raul Albino, director of Grupo Alpamayo, said he was hired by Stampfl’s family to retrieve the body. Lenin Alvardo, one of the police officers who participated in the recovery operation, said Stampfl’s clothes were still mostly intact. The hip pouch with his driving license also contained a pair of sunglasses, a camera, a voice recorder and two decomposing $20 bills. A gold wedding ring was still on the left hand. “I’ve never seen anything like that” Alvarado said. Huascaran is Peru’s highest peak. Hundreds of climbers visit the mountain each year with local guides, and it typically takes them about a week to reach the summit. However, climate change has affected Huascaran and the surrounding peaks higher than 5,000 meters, known as the Cordillera Blanca. According to official figures, the Cordillera Blanca has lost 27% of its ice sheet over the past five decades. Stampfl was with friends Matthew Richardson and Steve Erskine in trying to climb Huascaran in 2002. They had traveled the world to climb challenging mountains and had reached the peaks of Kilimanjaro, Rainier, Shasta and Denali, according to a Los Angeles Times report at the time. Erskine’s body was found shortly after the avalanche, but Richardson’s corpse is still missing. Jennifer Stampfl said a plaque in memory of the three friends was placed at the summit of Mount Baldy in Southern California, where the trio trained for their expeditions. She said they may return to the site with her father’s remains. Janet Stampfl-Raymer, who was Stampfl’s wife, said that when her husband wasn’t working as a civil engineer, he loved to be a mountaineer. “He was a kind man. He was humble. He loved God, and he loved the mountains,” she said. “We all just dearly loved my husband. He was one of a kind,” she said. “We’re very grateful we can bring his body home to rest.” Stampfl carefully planned his mountaineering expeditions, his daughter said. She also said he was very humble and did not like to draw attention to himself. “The fact that he is in the news, it is so not my dad,” she said. Comments are not available on this story.",

                    "title": "Bipartisan Senate group pushes ban on lawmaker stock trading",
                    "text": "A bipartisan group of Senators unveiled a new proposal that would ban members of Congress, their spouses and dependent children from trading individual stocks. Oregon Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, Michigan Senator Gary Peters, Georgia Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff and Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley are outlining a new version of a measure dubbed the \"ETHICS Act,\" Ending Trading and Holdings in Congressional Stocks. Peters, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee, is expected to take up the bill in his committee later this month. Merkley previewed the new proposal in an exclusive interview with NPR, saying, \"if you want to serve in Congress don't come here to serve your portfolio, come here to serve the people.\" He argued the the issue cuts across party lines, \"The public is absolutely united in saying stock trading is wrong,\" Merkley said, pointing to a University of Maryland poll indicating 85% of the public backed banning trading by members of Congress. There current law requires lawmakers to disclose when they trade individual stocks, but critics say it's unevenly enforced and insufficient. The STOCK (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge) Act, enacted in 2012, directs members of congress and their spouses to disclose any trades for transactions over $1,000 within 45 days. Insider trading laws apply to lawmakers, but the push more to require more transparency about their investments came after the 2009 financial crisis. Several lawmakers made large profits after trading financial services stocks before major banks began to fold. Those trades raised questions about whether they were profiting from information they learn on congressional committees. \"The fact that members of Congress do better than a generalized portfolio suggests that there's privileged information that folks hear about — may not be inside information, maybe it's early information, maybe it's an insight that comes from working on a sector through your committee work or so on an so forth, But that is an issue,\" Merkley said. The new bill, if passed, would direct lawmakers to stop buying any new individual stocks immediately and at the beginning of the next session of congress in 2027 lawmakers will be required to divest from any individual assets. Previous reform proposals directed lawmakers to shift assets into blind trusts, but this measure specifies mutual funds. Congressional staffers are not covered by the proposal. \"We've struggled for along time whether to include blind trusts, they're complicated and it's really simplification in this case. People will not be holding stocks and that's the cleanest, most pure form of this,\" Merkley said. Several House and Senate bipartisan efforts have been introduced in recent years, but none have made it far enough to be considered by committees. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi—who doesn't trade stocks, but whose husband is an active trader—initially opposed new reforms, but opened the door to passing legislation around the 2022 midterms. Several amendments to change the law have been pushed unsuccessfully in the Senate, but no panel has moved legislation to address concerns since the STOCK act passed. The current law includes an enforcement mechanism that experts say is weak, with lawmakers facing a $200 fine for failing to report trades within the required deadline, which advocates say is the only way to track whether investments could be related to official duties. But members of both parties admit they have failed to file reports on time, and some file weeks or even more than a year late. The Senate proposal would expand penalties. Under the plan, a failure to divest would result in fines of either the value of lawmaker's monthly salary or 10% of the values of each asset that's in violation of the law - whichever is greater. \"The fines are huge in this bill,\" Merkley said, stressing the penalties are assessed monthly, noting, \"a person who is in violation would run up huge impacts very, very quickly.\" Under the new Senate proposal all lawmakers and new members elected would have to alter existing portfolios by March 31, 2027. They would be given 120 days to divest all covered investments. The proposal also includes a provision requiring a certificate of divestiture covering both the President and the vice president. If lawmaker leaves public service there would be a 90 day \"cooling off\" period during which they would still be barred from investing in individual stocks. It would also increase the penalty for non-reporting to $500 and require that all disclosures be in a searchable public database. The disclosures that lawmakers currently file have prompted financial services companies to create products that model lawmakers' investments. Those funds have consistently beat the market — a dynamic that non profit groups pushing for reforms demonstrate that the public doesn't trust their elected officials. Merkley acknowledged that it's unlikely the proposal would get a standalone vote, but he says he is aiming to get it attached to another must pass bill this year. He admitted moving the issue has been difficult when pushing a law impacting lawmakers financial portfolios, saying \"members of Congress get very twitchy and when you say your family will be covered too, they have concerns.\"",

                    "text": "July 10 (UPI) -- A bipartisan group of senators unveiled Wednesday an agreement on legislation that would ban members of Congress, including the president and vice president, from stock trading. The renewed effort is being lead by Sens. Gary Peters, D-Mich., Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Jon Ossoff, D-Ga. \"Americans deserve to have confidence that their federal elected officials are making decisions that are in the best interest of the American public and not in the interest of any personal finances,\" Peters, the Senate's Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee chair, said Wednesday at a press conference in Washington, adding that the Senate panel would take the \"historic step\" to consider the bill on July 24. This will be the first time Congress has formally considered such legislation. Under the bill's framework, members of Congress would be \"immediately\" banned from trading stocks if it becomes law, according to Merkley. The legislation if passed beginning March 2027 would then prohibit lawmakers' spouses and dependent children from trading stocks as well. Also starting that year, the U.S. president, vice president and all members of Congress would have to divest from any \"covered investments.\" But Hawley says he is not sure now if enough members will support the measure to get it passed. \"Congress should not be here to make a buck,\" the Missouri Republican said Wednesday on Capitol Hill. \"There is no reason why members of Congress ought to be profiting off of the information that only they get.\" Experts say the privileged information given to members of Congress in both the House and Senate chambers provides an unfair advantage in investing not afforded to a typical American. Ossoff in 2022 joined Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., introducing a similar bill to prohibit congress members from trading stocks while in office, a move that was followed when Hawley introduced a similar bill of his own. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., whose own husband Paul Pelosi is a wealthy investor who often makes trades, only last year began to soften in her opposition to such legislation, dismissing such ideas to prevent lawmakers from participating in the \"free market economy.\" But Pelosi's switch on the issue was only after she got a letter singed by 27 House members -- two Republicans and 25 Democrats -- urging members of Congress be banned from trading or owning stocks. That letter also was addressed to then-Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. In September last year, former Rep. Stephen Buyer, R-Ind., was sentenced to nearly 2 years behind bars after being convicted of four counts of securities fraud stemming from two insider trading schemes allegedly created with non-public information. However, the alleged crimes took place after Buyer had left Congress in 2011. Former President Barack Obama signed the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, known as the STOCK Act, on April 4, 2012, a law that only then officially banned insider trading by members of Congress. Meanwhile, it took until 2022 for the Federal Reserve to enact rules banning or restricting certain investment and trading activities by Fed officials, designed to \"support public confidence in the impartiality and integrity of the Committee's work by guarding against even the appearance of any conflict of interest.\"",

Starting March 2027, the bill would prohibit representatives’ spouses and dependent children from trading stocks and require the president, vice president and members of Congress to divest from any covered investments. The penalty for not divesting investments would be either the representative’s monthly salary or 10% of the value of each asset in violation, whichever is higher. The proposal piggybacks off of the STOCK Act – existing legislation that prohibits insider trading among members of Congress – and proposes an amendment to increase penalties for STOCK Act violations. The bill is part of a longtime battle to ban members of Congress from stock trading amid claims that representatives have an unfair advantage when stock trading because of their access to confidential information. “Why should members of Congress be spending their time day trading rather than focusing on the priorities the American people sent us here to achieve and focus on?” Hawley said. Ossoff has pushed for similar stock trading bans since he first joined the Senate in 2021. Calls to ban stock trading among members of Congress grew during the pandemic, when several senators sold stocks in a profitable move in the early days of the crisis just before the market crashed. The Department of Justice launched a probe into the trades, though no charges were made and the matter was closed. Then, former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dropped her opposition to the stock trading ban before the 2022 midterm elections. Pelosi – whose husband Paul Pelosi is a millionaire investor – initially opposed the ban. Hawley introduced a similar stock trading ban in early 2023 called the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act – or PELOSI Act.",

                    "text": "The Israeli military said Wednesday it has ordered the evacuation of Gaza City, which was an early target of the war that is now seeing renewed fighting. The military dropped leaflets on the city, calling on people to head south and saying “Gaza City will remain a dangerous combat zone.” The evacuation order could signal that Israel is expanding an incursion into the city, where it has been operating in several outlying neighborhoods in recent days. It was the latest sign that Hamas is regrouping in areas that Israel previously said it had cleared of militants. Israeli airstrikes early Wednesday killed 20 Palestinians in central Gaza, including six children and three women, some of them inside a purported “safe zone” declared by the Israeli military, hospital authorities said. This second straight night of deadly strikes in the central town of Deir al-Balah and nearby refugee camps came as U.S., Egyptian and Qatari mediators as well as Israeli officials came together in the Qatari capital, Doha, for talks trying to push through a long-elusive deal for a cease-fire and hostage release. Israel and Hamas had appeared to narrow the gaps in recent days, but obstacles remain. Strikes early Wednesday hit three houses in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing 12 people including five children, said authorities at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the casualties were taken. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies. The camp, like others around Gaza, was originally erected to house Palestinians driven from their homes during the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation. It has grown into an urban neighborhood in the decades since. A fourth strike early Wednesday killed four men, three women and a child when it hit a home in Deir al-Balah, an area that is located within the “humanitarian safe zone” where Israel has told Palestinians to seek refuge as it conducts offensives in multiple parts of the Gaza Strip. The overnight bombardment came hours after Israeli warplanes struck the entrance of a school sheltering displaced families outside the southern city of Khan Younis. The toll from the strike rose to 31 people killed, including eight children, and more than 50 wounded, officials at the nearby Nasser Hospital said Wednesday. Footage aired by Al-Jazeera television showed kids playing soccer in the school’s yard when a sudden boom shook the area, prompting shouts of “a strike, a strike!” The Israeli army said the airstrike near the school and reports of civilian casualties were under review, and claimed it was targeting a Hamas militant who took part in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, though it provided no immediate evidence. The military blames civilian deaths on Hamas because the militants fight in dense, urban areas. But the army rarely comments on what it is targeting in individual strikes, which often kill women and children. In nine months of bombardment and offensives in Gaza, Israel has killed more than 38,200 people and wounded more than 88,000, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Nearly the entire population has been driven from their homes. Many have been displaced multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are packed into sweltering tent camps. Israel’s onslaught was triggered by Hamas’ cross-border raid on Oct. 7, during which militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel, most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities. The militants took roughly 250 people hostage. About 120 are still in captivity, with about a third said to be dead. This week, Israeli troops have also been waging a new ground assault in Gaza City in the north of the territory — its latest effort to battle Hamas militants regrouping in areas the army previously said had been largely cleared. Large parts of Gaza City and urban areas around it have been flattened or left a shattered landscape by previous Israeli assaults, and much of the population fled earlier in the war. But the latest incursions and bombardment prompted a new flight of people. After Israel on Monday called for an evacuation from eastern and central parts of Gaza City, staff at two hospitals — Al-Ahli and the Patients Friends Association Hospital — rushed to move patients and shut down, the United Nations said. The Israeli military said Tuesday that it told hospitals and other medical facilities in Gaza City they did not need to evacuate. But hospitals in Gaza have often shut down and moved patients at any sign of possible Israeli military action, fearing raids. In the past nine months, Israeli troops have attacked at least eight hospitals, causing the deaths of patients and medical workers along with massive destruction to facilities and equipment. Israel has claimed Hamas uses hospitals for military purposes, though it has provided only limited evidence. Only 13 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are functioning, and those only partially, according to the United Nations’ humanitarian office. International mediators were making a new concerted effort to push through a proposed cease-fire deal. An Egyptian official said the head of Egypt’s General Intelligence Service, Abbas Kamel, went to Doha to join discussions over the deal. The official said U.S. and Israeli officials were also attending. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the press on the meetings. A day earlier, CIA Director William Burns, who has led the American mediation, met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi in Cairo Obstacles remain in the talks, even after Hamas agreed to relent on its key demand that Israel commit to ending the war as part of any agreement. Hamas still wants mediators to guarantee that negotiations conclude with a permanent cease-fire. Israel has rejected any deal that would force it to end the war with Hamas intact. Hamas on Monday accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of “putting more obstacles in the way of negotiations,” including the operations in Gaza City.

                    "text": "By WAFAA SHURAFA and SAMY MAGDY Associated Press DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The Israeli military urged all Palestinians to leave Gaza City and head south Wednesday, pressing ahead with a fresh offensive across the north, south and center of the embattled territory that has killed dozens of people over the past 48 hours. The stepped-up military activity came as U.S., Egyptian and Qatari mediators were meeting with Israeli officials in the Qatari capital, Doha, for talks seeking a long-elusive cease-fire deal with Gaza’s Hamas, which has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada and the European Union. Israel says it is pursuing Hamas fighters regrouping in various parts of Gaza nine months into the war. But heavy strikes in recent days along the length of the territory also could be aimed at hiking up pressure on Hamas in the cease-fire talks. In a visit Wednesday to central Gaza, Israel’s military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said forces were operating in different ways, in multiple parts of the territory “to carry out a very important mission: pressure. We will continue operating to bring home the hostages.” Israel informed people in Gaza of the evacuation order by dropping leaflets urging “all those in Gaza City” to take two “safe routes” south to the area around the central town of Deir al-Balah. Gaza City, it said, will “remain a dangerous combat zone.” Months ago, Israel ordered residents of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, to flee south, and much of the population left earlier in the war. Large parts of Gaza City and urban areas around it have been flattened or left a shattered landscape by previous Israeli assaults. The United Nations says about 200,000 Palestinians have remained in the hard-hit north, and many say they have nowhere safe to go. Most of Gaza’s 2.3 million people are crammed into squalid tent camps in central and southern Gaza. Israeli ground troops have pushed into parts of Gaza City in recent days, triggering the flight of thousands of Palestinians trying to escape shelling and airstrikes. This past week, the military ordered Palestinians to evacuate from eastern and central parts of the city. There was no immediate mass exodus out of the city following Wednesday’s order. Many Palestinians have concluded that there is no refuge in war-stricken Gaza. The evacuation order came after a series of deadly strikes over the past two days in other parts of the territory. Israeli bombardment early Wednesday hit four houses in Deir al-Balah and the nearby Nuseirat refugee camp, killing 20 Palestinians. Among the dead were six children and three women, according to officials at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the casualties were taken. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies.

                    "title": "Will There Be a Your Honor Season 3? Everything We Know So Far",
                    "text": "Your Honor, the Showtime drama series, is a whirlwind of moral dilemma, existential woes and strife for justice with Bryan Cranston leading the charge as Judge Michael Desiato. When it originally debuted, the title was intended to be a one-season miniseries but ultimately became a two-season phenomenon. Seasons 1 and 2 aired on Showtime from 2020 to 2022 and became available to stream for Showtime subscribers on Paramount+ — until the drama became available on Netflix in late May 2024. Since then, Your Honor has consistently remained in the top 10 list, eventually dethroning Bridgerton for the No. 1 spot in early July 2024. Your Honor centers on the story of a New Orleans judge, Michael Desiato (Cranston), who compromises his ethics to protect his son, Adam (Hunter Doohan), after a fatal hit-and-run accident involving the Rocco Baxter (Benjamin Wadsworth), son of a notorious mob boss, Jimmy Baxter (Michael Stuhlbarg). Desiato’s decision to safeguard his son from harm paradoxically sets off a chain of events with compounding consequences, ultimately ending in tragedy and Desiato behind bars ... twice. The show’s grip lies in the minute-by-minute turns that distort and dissect themes of justice, truth, redemption and morality — echoing similar thematic cores of Cranston’s iconic reign as Walter White in Breaking Bad. With millions of new fans and viewership skyrocketing, chatter of a third season has left viewers wondering if the season 2 finale is really the end of the story. Here’s everything to know about the drama series dominating streaming charts, and the possibility of a Your Honor season 3. What is Your Honor about? Your Honor follows the descent of Desiato, a respected judge in New Orleans whose life takes a dark turn when his son Adam accidentally kills Rocco, the son of Baxter, a notorious mob boss, in a hit-and-run accident. To protect Adam, Desiato makes a series of increasingly dubious decisions, drawing himself further into the realms of the organized crime world that he originally intended to shield his son from. As Desiato’s lies escalate, they offset a series of consequences, including the death of Kofi (Lamar Johnson) — an innocent man framed for Adam’s crime, and later killed in prison by the victim’s brother, Carlo (Jimi Stanton). In the middle of all this, Adam starts dating Fia (Lilli Kay), the sister of Carlo and Rocco, further intertwining himself into the family affected by the death he caused. The first season concludes as Kofi’s brother, Eugene (Benjamin Flores Jr.) seeks revenge after the Baxters firebomb Kofi’s home, killing his mother. Eugene attempts to shoot Carlo in retaliation but accidentally kills Adam instead — the irony being, of course, that Adam is technically the reason for both of their brothers' deaths. But the question of whether he deserved that kind of justice or if he was even truly at fault is what makes the show brutally agonizing and captivating. How did season 2 of Your Honor end? Desiato’s involvement in underground crime only broadens in season 2 as the former judge, now in prison, works with Assistant U.S. Attorney Olivia Delmont (Rosie Perez) to take down Baxter. While Desiato does confess the truth to Detective Costello (Amy Landecker), his confession is buried by Delmont — who instead concocts a plan to send Desiato to prison for tax evasion, so Baxter won’t suspect Desiato was the one who implicated him. The series unfolds as Desiato is released from prison and becomes more entangled with both past and present deceptions, an unsettling proximity to the Baxter family and a courtroom breaking point in the season finale. When Desiato is forced to testify at Eugene’s trial for Adam’s murder, he takes the stand and confesses everything — Adam killing Baxter’s son in the hit-and-run, covering it up and the web of lies that ultimately led to Kofi’s death, and later Eugene’s mother. Meanwhile, Baxter is shot and left hospitalized after his wife, Gina (Hope Davis), convinces her father, Carmine (Mark Margolis) — a high-ranking mob boss with mounting resentment against Baxter — to take him out. Afterward, Gina has her dad arrested for the crime thus giving her complete control over the crime syndicate. The season concludes with Desiato returning to prison — this time for crimes he did commit — and he's content with his fate. Will there be a Your Honor season 3? As of now, Your Honor hasn’t been renewed for a third season — but there are still glimmers of hope for fans. Cranston told Deadline in April 2023 that it’s not entirely out of the question. “There is some discussion. Showtime has indicated there is interest and we’re very proud to know that every episode in Season 2 increased in the audience from the previous week,” the actor said, adding that he’d “be very interested in producing that.” Despite Cranston expressing interest in being involved in the project, it doesn’t necessarily mean his character will be. The actor explained that he’d only reprise his role as Desiato if the season explored the reality of a father grieving his son. “I said, ‘This guy, if this really happened and you lost a child, it changes your life forever,” Cranston told Deadline. “So if you really want to show a man in abject despair, if there is any possibility of a life beyond that, let’s do it. But it has to be incrementally discovered,’ [Showtime] were willing to do that.” However, no official news of a third season of Your Honor has been confirmed.",

                    "text": "A Wonder Woman game is currently in the works at Monolith Productions, the studio behind Middle-earth: Shadows of Mordor and Middle-earth: Shadow of War. Slated to be an action-adventure game with open-world elements, the Wonder Woman game will have you step into the shiny boots of beloved DC hero Wonder Woman as she fights against the forces of evil. While we don't know much about the game as of yet, there are a few details we can piece together from the preview trailer as well as Monolith Productions' history. For instance, Monolith has a great track record when it comes to adapting beloved settings. The Middle-earth series was full of action-packed setpieces and captivating cuts that really did justice to J.R.R. Tolkien's timeless The Lord of the Rings universe. While they didn't distinguish themselves quite enough to earn a place on our lists of the best single-player games and the best story games, both titles are still well worth playing if you're a fan of fantasy action. Here's what we know about Wonder Woman so far. Wonder Woman game: cut to the chase What is it? An open-world Wonder Woman gameWhen does it come out? TBCWhat can I play it on? TBCWho is making it? Monolith Productions Wonder Woman gameplay We don't have a lot of information on Wonder Woman's game mechanics right now. We know it'll use the 'Nemesis System', previously seen in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War. The system created a procedurally generated hierarchy across enemy orcs, giving them more personality than your standard grunts. Considering we don't know who Diana will be facing, it's yet unknown how the system will be implemented. Unfortunately, the teaser trailer was purely cinematic and offered no real hints, beyond telling us that Diana's returning home to face a new threat. All we otherwise have is this official statement from David Hewitt, vice president and studio head at Monolith, who told us: \"The stories our players share inspire us every day, and we are honored to take players on a unique personal journey, driven by the values embodied in Wonder Woman. The Nemesis System raised the bar for player-driven storytelling and we’re excited to push the open-world genre forward, combining cutting-edge action with inventive narratives to create a Wonder Woman game everyone will want to play.\" Wonder Woman trailer The Wonder Woman announcement teaser trailer doesn't give much away, but it does give us a close-up look at the hero herself, complete with her iconic Lasso of Truth. There may not be much to go on, but we're suitably impressed with Monolith Production's take on Diana Prince when it comes to visual design. Besides the teaser, we are yet to see any other previews. In the meantime, we advise keeping an eye on Warner Bros. Games' official YouTube channel for new announcements down the line. Wonder Woman news Leaked concept art surfaces on job page As reported by our pals over at GamesRadar, Wonder Woman concept art has leaked online, showing character models for three characters in the upcoming superhero game. A developer at Monolith Productions was spotted with a piece of Wonder Woman concept art as their LinkedIn header image. It has since been removed. Procedural storytelling The upcoming Wonder Woman game will apparently have procedural storytelling. This was revealed in a Tweet from the game’s narrative director Tony Elias, who said that development studio Monolith was looking for a senior game writer to work on the Wonder Woman game. Wonder Woman: what we want to see An iconic lineup of enemies to fight We currently don't know who Diana's main adversaries with be in the Wonder Woman game, but it's almost certain that we'll see some familiar faces from the DC universe. We're hoping that Ares is the primary villain in Monolith's title, with the likes of Cheetah, Giganta, Circe, and Doctor Psycho making appearances in some form - perhaps sitting just below Ares in the Nemesis System ranks. What's more likely (and makes more sense) is that Wonder Woman will take on Villainy Incorporated. The Nemesis System would do a great job at capturing the dynamic of an evil organization, complete with its own rank structures and internal politics. An invisible jet Sure, it's cheesy, but we would love to see Monolith (somehow) make Wonder Woman's invisible jet cool. Wonder Woman 1984 did - kind of - but it would be great to see the developer integrate the jet into gameplay in a way that doesn't feel shoehorned. Combat that feels good One thing we've learned from recent superhero games is that how a hero feels to play is a make-or-break factor. We're hoping that Wonder Woman feels as strong as she is meant to be, with powerful melee attacks and - of course - the ability to Lasso of Truth our enemies. Utilizing the power of the PS5 and Xbox Series X Going off our last point, we would love to see Monolith adding haptic feedback and adaptive controller support to the Wonder Woman game, so we can really feel the tension in the lasso or the feel of kicking Cheetah in the face (hopefully). We're also expecting (more than hoping) that Wonder Woman will have minimal loading screens despite being an open-world title. You Might Also Like...

                    "title": "‘Stranger Things’ Season 5: Everything We Know So Far About The Final Season (July 2024 Update)",
                    "text": "Plot Stranger Things season 5 begins with the sound of “COLD WIND.” If that doesn’t get you excited, maybe this will? The final season will be “heartbreaking,” “bonkers,” and “completely insane.” It’s eight episodes long, which doesn’t sound like a lot considering how many mysteries still need to be solved, but some — if not all — of the episodes will be movie length. “We’re making basically eight movies,” Maya Hawke, who plays Robin (and Anxiety in Inside Out 2), said on the Podcrushed podcast. “Season 4 and season 5 are very connected. Season 4 had a part I and part II because they separated them, so the last two episodes came out at a different time, which is unusual for streaming. But this is its own season. It is a continuation, but it’s the finale. And it has been a long time since last season.” (Note: she said “eight movies” instead of “an eight-hour long movie,” a small but important distinction, because an eight-hour movie sounds terrible.) Unlike in season 4, where the characters were spread across the globe, season 5 will be more “isolated,” according to Finn Wolfhard (Mike Wheeler). “Not being around everyone all the time was definitely a bummer about filming 4, but 5 is the opposite,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “We’re all together all the time, and a bunch of us live around the corner and across the street from each other in real life. So the cast is really seeing each other a lot, and we’re in a lot of the same scenes, which has been really great.” And yes, at long last, there will (probably) be deaths. And maybe time jumps. Cast Most of the familiar faces will be black, albeit three years older than the last time we saw them. The confirmed season 5 cast includes “wifey” Millie Bobby Brown (Eleven), feet fan David Harbour (Jim Hopper), Winona Ryder (Joyce Byers), Finn Wolfhard (Mike Wheeler), Noah Schnapp (Will Byers), Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin Henderson), Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas Sinclair), Sadie Sink (Max Mayfield), Charlie Heaton (Jonathan Byers), Natalia Dyer (Nancy Wheeler), Joe Keery (Steve Harrington), Maya Hawke (Robin Buckley), Brett Gelman (Murray Bauman), Priah Ferguson (Erica Sinclair), Jamie Campbell Bower (Vecna), Cara Buono (Karen Wheeler), and Amybeth McNulty (Vickie). Newcomers include The Terminator legend Linda Hamilton. “I don’t know how to be a fangirl and an actress at the same time,” she said about appearing on the show. “I’m gonna work on that.” As for Joseph Quinn, who played Eddie Munson in season 4, the A Quiet Place: Day One and Gladiator II star teased that “chances are high” he’ll spend more time with his former co-workers. Maybe the Quiet Place cat can make a cameo? And/or be the one to kill Vecna.",

                    "text": "Jon Bon Jovi’s mom, Carol Bongiovi, has died three days ahead of her 84th birthday. The rocker confirmed his parent’s Tuesday passing to Page Six, remembering her as a “force to be reckoned with.” The Grammy winner, 62, continued, “Her spirit and can-do attitude shaped this family. She will be greatly missed.” Bon Jovi released the statement on behalf of his family, which includes her husband of 63 years, John Bongiovi Sr., and sons Anthony Bongiovi and Matthew Bongiovi, as well as their respective wives Nina and Desiree. Carol is also survived by her eight grandchildren. Bon Jovi is a father of four, with the singer sharing Stephanie, 31, Jesse, 29, Jake, 22, and Romeo, 20, with his wife, Dorothea Hurley. The “Livin’ on a Prayer” crooner has long gushed over Carol as an early supporter of his career — and the 83-year-old even founded his eponymous fan club. “[My parents] were always supportive of me, which in retrospect, was incredible,” Bon Jovi told the Big Issue in 2020 of launching his band in his teens. “I could get home at one or two in the morning, and have to still be in school by eight o’clock,” he recalled. “They just said, ‘Show up on time for school, you know that is your responsibility, but pursue your dream.'” Before becoming a mother, Carol was a Playboy Bunny and a member of the U.S. Marine Corps. She met John while serving, and the couple raised their family in Sayreville, N.J., before ultimately settling in Holmdel, N.J. Holmdel Funeral Home is handling Carol’s private funeral arrangements. Bon Jovi has had a busy year, with his band’s Hulu docuseries, “Thank You Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story,” airing in April. The musician sent tongues wagging with his scandalous comments about his marriage while doing press for the project, from admitting he wasn’t a “saint” to confessing he got “away with murder.” Additionally, two of the guitarist’s children made headlines for their weddings, with Jesse walking down the aisle in Las Vegas in May and Jake marrying “Stranger Things” star Millie Bobbie Brown that same month.",

                    "text": "Jon Bon Jovi’s mother, Carol A. Bongiovi, died yesterday, July 9, at the Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, New Jersey. She was 83. Bon Jovi confirmed his mother’s death in a statement, though no cause was given. She died just three days before her 84th birthday. “Our mother was a force to be reckoned with, her spirit and can-do attitude shaped this family,” Bon Jovi said. “She will be greatly missed.” Bongiovi played an important role in fostering her son’s musical ambitions. She’s probably best known for launching the Bon Jovi fan club and running it out of the flower shop she ran in Woodbridge, New Jersey. But she also encouraged Bon Jovi’s love of performing and music as a kid, buying him his first acoustic guitar when he was just seven, according to Laura Jackson’s Bon Jovi biography. In the 2021 video for Bon Jovi’s “Story of Love,” the musician honored his whole family, but especially the long relationship between his mother and father, John Bongiovi, Sr. The clip found Bon Jovi singing the song in a room filled with old family heirlooms and photos, including a prominent portrait of his parents when they were younger. Bongiovi was born Carol Sharkey and grew up in Erie, Pennsylvania. She enlisted in the Marines in 1959, met her future husband there, and the couple soon married and moved to Sayreville, New Jersey. The couple had three kids, Jon (real name John Francis Bongiovi Jr.), Anthony, and Matthew. In a 2007 interview with The Telegraph, Bon Jovi said of his childhood, “‘It was your typical 1960s-1970s kinda upbringing. I really admire that my parents stayed together; they toughed it out, the good and the bad.” While Carol eventually became a florist (and John Sr. ran a beauty salon), she famously spent some time working as a bunny at one of the Playboy clubs in Manhattan. In a 2006 interview with Larry King, Bon Jovi recalled, “I did go there as a kid. Oh God, did I have the stories and the pictures. They had their little outfit and my dad was like this hip cat because he was married to a Playboy bunny.” Speaking with the Big Issue in 2020 about his parents’ influence on his life, Bon Jovi said he got from them the “ability to make the dream reality.” He continued: “Even if you truly weren’t any good at your craft, if you believed you were, you could work on it. As I got older I realized that was a great gift that I got from my folks. They truly believed in the John Kennedy mantra of going to the moon. ‘Yeah, of course you can go to the moon. Just go, Johnny.’ And there I went.”",

No cause of death was given.The loss comes just three days before Carol's 84th birthday. \"Our mother was a force to be reckoned with. Her spirit and can-do attitude shaped this family. She will be greatly missed,\" the singer said in a statement shared to People Magazine.Bon Jovi's mother, born Carol Sharkey in Erie, Pennsylvania, was described as an entrepreneur with many businesses, and used to work as a Playboy Bunny. She joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1959, which is where she met her husband, John Bongiovi Sr. The couple would go on to raise their family in Sayreville, New Jersey, before moving to Holmdel, New Jersey, where she lived for the remainder of her life.Bon Jovi's parents Carol and John were featured in the music video for \"Story of Love,\" released in 2021. Carol was the founder of Jon Bon Jovi's official fan club, and ran it out of the flower shop she owned in Woodbridge, New Jersey, when his band began to find fame.She is survived by her husband of 63 years, her three sons and daughters-in-law, as well as her eight grandchildren, per her obituary shared on the Holmdel Funeral Home website.The family's loss comes after Bon Jovi, wife Dorothea Hurley, son Jake Bongiovi, 22, and his new wife, Millie Bobby Brown, 20, were enjoying a vacation in Porto Cervo, Sardinia. The family was all smiles in photos obtained by Page Six on the vacation, which also seemed to be a honeymoon for newlyweds Jake and Brown. The young couple tied the knot in a secret, \"low-key\" ceremony in May 2024, but are reportedly planning a larger ceremony in Italy for later this summer.Brown and Jake had also celebrated their honeymoon at Universal Studios Orlando in June 2024. The pair shared a joint Instagram post featuring a carousel of loved-up photos on June 3. Brown showed off her new marital status by sporting a \"wife of the party\" baseball cap, in addition to denim shorts and a bracelet emblazoned with the word \"wifey.\"",

                    "text": "Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has been accused of not disclosing a yacht trip to Russia and a private helicopter flight to a palace in President Vladimir Putin’s hometown, among a slew of other gifts and loans from businessman Harlan Crow. Buried on page 14 of a letter that two Democratic senators sent to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday, in which they urged Garland to appoint a special counsel to probe Thomas, was an astonishing list of dozens of “likely undisclosed gifts and income” from Crow, Crow’s affiliated companies, and “other donors.” In the letter, Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) said Thomas, one of the court’s staunchly conservative justices, even may have committed tax fraud and violated other federal laws by “secretly” accepting the gifts and income potentially worth millions. “The Senate is not a prosecutorial body, and the Supreme Court has no fact-finding function of its own, making the executive role all the more important if there is ever to be any complete determination of the facts,” reads the letter requesting the appointment of a special prosecutor. “We do not make this request lightly,” said the letter. The list of potentially secret gifts also includes a loan of more than $267,000 provided by Thomas’ close friend Anthony Welters, the yacht trip to Russia from the Baltics, and the helicopter ride to Yusupov Palace in St. Petersburg. ProPublica first reported last year on the existence of extensive undisclosed gifts and lavish trips from Crow. Additionally, Justice Thomas is accused of not disclosing tuitions for his grandnephew, free lodging, real estate transactions, and home renovations. The action escalates Democratic senators’ efforts to hold Thomas accountable for perceived ethics controversies. According to the senators, Thomas’ conduct could violate the Ethics in Government Act, which requires officials like Supreme Court justices to file annual reports disclosing gifts and income accepted from outside sources. “It is a crime,” reads the report, “To knowingly and willfully fail to file or report such information.” Since 2023, two Senate committees have been looking into the 1991 loan from Welters that was connected to Thomas’ purchase of a luxury motor home. Welters previously responded to a New York Times request for comment on the loan only to say that it was “satisfied.” Thomas, for his part, belatedly disclosed some—but not all—gifts from Crow this year and has defended the gifts as “personal hospitality” from some of his and his wife’s “dearest friends.” “The evidence assembled thus far plainly suggests that Justice Thomas has committed numerous willful violations of federal ethics and false-statement laws and raises significant questions about whether he and his wealthy benefactors have,” Durban and Wyden wrote.",

                    "text": "A few years after former President George W. Bush claimed he looked into Putin's eyes \"and saw his soul,\" U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas enjoyed a yacht trip to Saint Petersburg, where Vladimir Putin was born. The Daily Beast found buried on page 14 of a senate letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland that Thomas neglected to mention yet another free trip on a yacht. Raw Story reported that Democratic senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) submitted a letter alleging several “likely undisclosed gifts and income.\" Read Also: How Trump and Senate Republicans are circling the wagons to save Clarence Thomas “The Senate is not a prosecutorial body, and the Supreme Court has no fact-finding function of its own, making the executive role all the more important if there is ever to be any complete determination of the facts,” the letter says asking for the appointment of a special prosecutor. The Beast dug into the report to compare the list of improprieties with previous reports published by ProPublica over the past year. There's a full list of secret gifts to Thomas, including a loan for more than $267,000 from Anthony Welters. It also included the secret 2003 yacht trip to Russia from the Baltics and a helicopter ride to the Yusupov Palace. The Senate list includes \"likely undisclosed gifts and income from Harlan Crow,\" the big GOP donor previously named for large contributions and luxury vacations. It also lists \"likely undisclosed gifts and income from other donors.\" One of those individuals is Wayne Huizenga, who died in 2018 but paid for a private plane trip from South Florida to Tampa in 2003. In 2004 he used Miami Dolphins cash to fly Thomas around on a private plane, according to the reports. Another big donor was the former NatsJets CEO David Sokol, who footed the bill for the Jackson Hole, WY trip, flights to several states and Washington, D.C., and tickets to a Nebraska football and volleyball game. Paul Anthony Novelly, of Apex Oil, only provided a few private plane trips for Thomas. Read the remainder of the details here. See the screen captures below or at the link here.

                    "text": "Texas is receiving federal aid for Hurricane Beryl later than needed because state leaders were slow to request an official disaster declaration from the White House, President Joe Biden told the Houston Chronicle Tuesday. With Gov. Greg Abbott out of the country on an economic development trip in Asia, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has served as acting governor amid the storm, making him responsible for putting in the state’s request for aid. A White House spokesperson told the Chronicle that officials had tried multiple times to reach Abbott and Patrick, and Biden said he only connected with Patrick Tuesday, after which he issued the disaster declaration. Beryl came ashore on Texas' Gulf Coast early Monday morning, bringing heavy rain and winds that wreaked havoc over Houston and other parts of southeast Texas. Patrick denied Biden's account, writing on social media that the president was \"falsely accusing\" him of being unreachable. \"I am disappointed that President Biden is turning Hurricane Beryl into a political issue,\" Patrick said, describing a \"cordial call\" with Biden earlier Tuesday in which the president granted his request for a major disaster declaration. Patrick added that state officials \"needed to determine what our outstanding needs were\" before they could make an official request. \"We were working on that with local officials as we traveled the impacted areas,\" Patrick said. \"As I was being briefed today, the president called.\" An Abbott spokesperson added that Biden's comments were \"a complete lie\" and said the president and his administration \"know exactly how to get in contact with the Governor and have on numerous occasions in the past.\" \"The State of Texas has been working closely with FEMA and other federal partners ahead of and throughout the storm to get the support Texas needs,\" Abbott press secretary Andrew Mahaleris said in a statement. \"The State of Texas had all necessary disaster declarations in place well before today, despite what President Biden said.\" As Beryl approached the Texas coast, Patrick issued a state disaster declaration authorizing the use of \"all available resources of state government\" needed to respond to the storm. At issue Tuesday, though, was the state's request for federal aid, which Patrick made earlier in the day. The major disaster declaration from Biden allows federal officials to help Texas pay for debris removal and emergency supplies and goods. In a statement early Tuesday evening, Biden noted that FEMA resources had been on the ground in Texas “since well before the storm.\" That included 500,000 meals and 800,000 liters of water that were \"ready to distribute at the state's request,\" FEMA officials said in a statement Monday. The agency also deployed 60 generators \"to provide power to critical infrastructure, if needed.\" The disaster declaration includes 121 counties, including Harris County and other parts of southeast Texas that were hit hard by Beryl, Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said at a press conference Tuesday afternoon. Biden, a Democrat, has frequently butted heads with Abbott, Patrick and other Texas GOP leaders over immigration policy and other areas. Politics have also regularly infused the response to past Texas storms, most recently when then-Land Commissioner George P. Bush, a Republican, feuded with then-Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, over Hurricane Harvey aid. Bush also accused the Biden administration of using \"red tape\" and \"complex regulations\" to slow the distribution of aid. The political sparring came as millions of Texans remained without power as temperatures climbed into the 90s in parts of the state, one day after Beryl’s deadly winds and rain caused widespread damage.

At issue Tuesday, though, was the state's request for federal aid, which Patrick made earlier in the day. The major disaster declaration from Biden allows federal officials to help Texas pay for debris removal and emergency supplies and goods. In a statement early Tuesday evening, Biden noted that FEMA resources had been on the ground in Texas \"since well before the storm.\" That included 500,000 meals and 800,000 liters of water that were \"ready to distribute at the state's request,\" FEMA officials said in a statement Monday. The agency also deployed 60 generators \"to provide power to critical infrastructure, if needed.\" The disaster declaration includes 121 counties, including Harris County and other parts of southeast Texas that were hit hard by Beryl, Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said at a press conference Tuesday afternoon. A TDEM spokesperson said the state had been able to fulfill all requests from local officials, and FEMA officials had been in briefings with Kidd and Patrick \"before, during, and after\" Beryl and have \"a permanent seat in our State Emergency Operations Center.\" Biden, a Democrat, has frequently butted heads with Abbott, Patrick and other Texas GOP leaders over immigration policy and other areas. Politics have also regularly infused the response to past Texas storms, most recently when then-Land Commissioner George P. Bush, a Republican, feuded with then-Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, over Hurricane Harvey aid. Bush also accused the Biden administration of using \"red tape\" and \"complex regulations\" to slow the distribution of aid. The political sparring came as millions of Texans remained without power as temperatures climbed into the 90s in parts of the state, one day after Beryl's deadly winds and rain caused widespread damage.

This batch of cases may be the first indication of the legal upheaval that could play out across the judiciary in the U.S. now that one of the most widely cited Supreme Court decisions has been overturned. Several conservative anti-regulation groups have been preparing for the post-Chevron world by planning legal challenges and lobbying efforts, according to a new report. Four days after the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Loper Bright Enterprises vs. Raimondo, overturning the 40-year-old precedent known as the Chevron deference, the justices announced they would be sending nine cases back to lower courts in light of their ruling. This batch of cases may be the first indication of the legal upheaval that could play out across the United States judiciary now that one of the most widely cited Supreme Court opinions has been reversed. \"The majority's decision today will cause a massive shock to the legal system,\" Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissenting opinion. By reversing its 1984 ruling in the case of Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council — which let judges defer to federal agencies' interpretation of statutes when language was unclear — the court slashed the authority of regulators and empowered the judiciary. It also called into question the fate of the more than 19,000 past federal cases that cite the precedent. In his majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts appeared to anticipate this consequence. \"The holdings of those cases that specific agency actions are lawful — including the Clean Air Act holding of Chevron itself — are still subject to statutory stare decisis,\" he wrote, referring to the legal principle of adhering to judicial precedent. But Roberts' stipulation may not be enough to stop the \"legal earthquake\" that the court created with its ruling, according to Cary Coglianese, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Penn Program on Regulation. The Supreme Court protected agencies' past actions, Coglianese explained, but it said little about the agencies' past interpretations of laws, leaving the door cracked open for prior cases to be challenged. \"On some reading of what the court has done, those opportunities to reopen [previously closed cases] are still there,\" he said, \"and you can expect that people will try to exploit those.\" Seizing the moment In two of the cases remanded to lower courts in light of the Loper decision, the plaintiffs share the same lawyer: the Pacific Legal Foundation, or PLF.

                    "text": "President Joe Biden will sit down with NBC News anchor Lester Holt for an interview on July 15 in Austin, Texas. The full Monday night interview will air in its entirety on NBC during a primetime special at 8 p.m. ET and will also stream on NBC News NOW. Portions of the interview will air earlier in the day on “NBC Nightly News With Lester Holt” at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT and clips and coverage will be available on NBCNews.com. The full interview and unedited transcript will also be available following the primetime special on NBCNews.com. Biden’s second major interview comes in the wake of a sit-down with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos on Thursday that was intended to control the damage done by his disastrous debate performance. That ABC interview did little to quell concerns from Democrats who believe Biden is not fit enough to defeat Donald Trump in the presidential election this November. The number of Democrats, donors and celebrities calling for Biden to step aside continues to grow. Early Wednesday, George Clooney — a lifelong Democrat and major donor who threw a fundraiser for Biden just last month — penned an op-ed calling for Biden to bow out of the presidential race. “The one battle he cannot win is the fight against time,” Clooney said. “None of us can. It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe ‘big F-ing deal‘ Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.” The president has rebuffed calls for him to step aside, sending a letter to congressional Democrats on Monday reiterating his intention to run. “I have heard the concerns that people have — their good faith fears and worries about what is at stake in this election. I am not blind to them,” Biden wrote. “I wouldn’t be running again if I did not absolutely believe I was the best person to beat Donald Trump in 2024.”",

                    "text": "President Biden is remaining defiant on his media tour as calls for him to withdraw from the 2024 race continue to mount. NBC News announced Wednesday that Biden will be sitting down with \"NBC Nightly News\" anchor Lestor Holt for a primetime special Monday airing at 9 p.m. ET, coinciding with the first night of the RNC convention in Milwaukee. The interview follows a string of post-debate media appearances including on ABC and MSNBC as well as his upcoming press conference scheduled for Thursday. BIDEN INTERVIEWERS SHED LIGHT ON HIS FRAILTY BEHIND THE SCENES: ‘IT’S IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO NOTICE' Biden has repeatedly vowed that he is staying in the race through November and intends to defeat former President Trump. But Democrats have been in disarray on Capitol Hill as they clash over whether to rally behind the beleaguered president or call for him to step aside. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., added fuel to the fire Wednesday morning during her appearance on MSNBC when saying \"I want him to do whatever he decides,\" suggesting there's an open door for Biden to step aside despite his letter to Democratic lawmakers on Monday reiterating he is staying in the race. Meanwhile, at least eight House Democrats have publicly called for Biden exit the race. ABC'S GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS AFTER BIDEN INTERVIEW: ‘I DON’T THINK HE CAN SERVE FOUR MORE YEARS' Another bombshell that dropped on Wednesday was the scathing guest essay published by Hollywood liberal George Clooney in The New York Times. Clooney, who had just hosted the star-studded Biden fundraiser in Los Angeles last month, called for a new nominee on the Democratic ticket and starkly revealed he witnessed the same Biden that the country saw at the presidential debate. \"It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney wrote. CRITICS PILE ON BIDEN FOLLOWING ABC INTERVIEW, BLAST HIS REFUSAL TO COMMIT TO COGNITIVE TEST: ‘DISQUALIFYING’ Last week's ABC interview with George Stephanopoulos was widely seen as a test for Biden to show he has the mental capacity to continue his reelection bid. However, the 22-minute sit-down has not eased tensions within his party. Biden raised eyebrows when he expressed uncertainty about whether he had watched the CNN debate, telling Stephanopoulos \"I don't think so, no.\" He shocked the country when he refused to commit to a cognitive test, repeatedly insisting he is tested every day in the role as the commander in chief. Biden also enraged Democrats when he said he would be content with a hypothetical defeat against former President Trump as long as he as he \"gave it [his] all.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP After the interview, Stephanopoulos went viral Tuesday in a video obtained by TMZ saying he didn't think Biden could serve four more years. The anchor later released a statement saying \"Earlier today I responded to a question from a passerby. I shouldn’t have.\" A spokesperson for ABC News told Fox News Digital \"George expressed his own point of view and not the position of ABC News.\"",

NBC’s Monica Alba announced the upcoming interview, writing on X, “BREAKING: @NBCNews anchor Lester Holt will sit down with President Biden for an exclusive one-on-one interview on Monday in Austin, Texas.” The entire interview is expected to air during a primetime special at 9:00 p.m. Eastern that same day. BREAKING: @NBCNews anchor Lester Holt will sit down with President Biden for an exclusive one-on-one interview on Monday in Austin, Texas. The full interview will air in its entirety during a primetime special that evening at 9 p.m. ET/8 p.m. CT. on NBC. — Monica Alba (@albamonica) July 10, 2024 Just days before the announcement, the outlet’s streaming channel, NBC News Now, ran an unhinged segment where a guest claimed Biden “definitely” has Parkinson’s disease. NBC gave Dr. Tom Pitts, a neurologist who has never examined or assessed the president in person, over six minutes to diagnose Biden based only on video clips. The upcoming interview comes as Biden wards off the concerns of Democrats following his poor debate performance, which showcased Biden oftentimes looking confused, freezing up, mumbling, and repeating thoroughly debunked talking points. RELATED — What Was That?! Biden Coughs, Stumbles, Rambles His Way Through Debate After Week of Rest and Prep Courtesy of CNN Presidential Debate Despite initial reactions, Biden has made it clear to congressional Democrats that he does not intend to step aside, writing in a letter this week that, “The Democratic Party have voted.” “They have chosen me to be the nominee of the party. Do we now just say this process didn’t matter?” Biden asked. “The voters don’t have a say?” “I decline to do that,” he continued, adding, “I feel a deep obligation to the faith and the trust the voters of the Democratic Party have placed in me to run this year. It was their decision to make. Not the press, not the pundits, not the big donors, not any selected group of individuals, no matter how well intentioned.” “The voters — and the voters alone — decide the nominee of the Democratic Party. How can we stand for democracy in our nation if we ignore it in our own party?” Biden posed. “I cannot do that. I will not do that.” This morning, I sent a letter to my fellow Democrats on Capitol Hill. In it, I shared my thoughts about this moment in our campaign. It’s time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump. pic.twitter.com/ABtAaJrr0n — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) July 8, 2024 Surely the issue will come up during the interview, as voters have yet to see solid cohesion in the Democrat Party. While some Democrats are standing behind Biden, others are walking the line, and some are still outright calling on the 81 year old to drop out of the race. This is the second interview Biden will have completed post-debate, the first of which occurred with ABC News’s George Stephanopoulos.",

                    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — The remnants of Hurricane Beryl spawned at least one tornado and threatened flooding Wednesday as the system churned toward Canada and the northeastern U.S. after leaving millions in the Houston area without power. Beryl, which landed in Texas on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, was a post-tropical cyclone and centered over southeastern Michigan around midday Wednesday with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph, the National Weather Service reported. A flood watch was in effect for parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, and rainfall warnings were issued for portions of southern Canada. The storm dumped 3 to 6 inches of rain in northern Indiana, saturating the ground and putting trees at risk of toppling in strong winds forecast for Wednesday afternoon. Parts of northern New York and New England could see heavy rain Wednesday, said Bob Oravec, a weather service forecaster. After Thursday, only a few showers can be expected across New England, he said. A tornado touched down Tuesday in Posey County in southwestern Indiana, officials said. The storm collapsed much of a warehouse and ripped off roofs, derailed train cars and damaged mobile homes. No injuries were reported. Jerrod Prather, a supervisor for Nutrien Ag Solutions, told the Evansville Courier & Press that he watched the tornado on a security camera. “I saw it come down and kind of lift back up, and then come down again,” he said. Beryl has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths — one in Louisiana and six in Texas — and at least 11 in the Caribbean. More than 1.6 million homes and businesses in Texas still lacked electricity late Wednesday morning, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. More than 56,000 homes and businesses lacked power in Indiana, Michigan and Ohio. Associated Press writer Sarah Brumfield in Silver Spring, Maryland, contributed to this report.",

                    "text": "The Russian prosecutor general's office on Wednesday declared The Moscow Times, an online newspaper popular among Russia’s expatriate community, as an “undesirable organization.” The designation comes amid a crackdown on critical news media and the opposition. It means the newspaper must stop any work in Russia and it subjects any Russian who cooperates with the paper to up to five years in prison. It is a more severe measure than the “foreign agent” designation applied to the news outlet in November, which subjects individuals and organizations to increased financial scrutiny and requires any of their public material to prominently include notice of being declared a foreign agent. The Moscow Times already moved its editorial operations out of Russia in 2022 after the passage of a law imposing stiff penalties for material regarded as discrediting the Russian military and its war in Ukraine. It publishes in English and in Russian, but its Russian-language site was blocked in Russia several months after the Ukraine war began. The publication began in 1992 as a daily print paper distributed for free in restaurants, hotels and other locations popular with expatriates, whose presence in Moscow was soaring after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It later reduced its print edition to weekly, then became online only in 2017. Russia in recent years has methodically targeted people and organizations critical of the Kremlin, branding many as “foreign agents” and some as “undesirable.\" Other news outlets declared as undesirable include the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, whose editor Dmitry Muratov won a Nobel Peace Prize, and and the online news site Meduza. Russia also has imprisoned prominent opposition figures including anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, who was President Vladimir Putin’s most persistent domestic foe, and dissidents Vladimir Kara-Murza and Ilya Yashin.",

                    "text": "A specialist website focused on naval activities around the world has shared an image it says shows a Russian Navy support ship docked at a Black Sea port in occupied Georgia where Moscow has vowed to establish a permanent naval base despite Tbilisi's objections. Naval News reported that the Russian Project 22870 craft shown in the satellite imagery it published on July 10 was \"observed in Ochamchire on July 4 and 5.\" It did not cite a source. There does not appear to have been any official reaction from either Russia or Georgia to the ship's alleged presence. But the appearance of a Russian Navy ship that is supporting the ongoing invasion of Ukraine at a port in Georgia's internationally recognized waters would almost certainly escalate Western concerns at Moscow's strategic and territorial ambitions in the region and could reignite tensions with Tbilisi. Russia has effectively occupied Abkhazia and the neighboring region of South Ossetia, which make up around one-fifth of Georgian territory, since a five-day war in 2008. The Georgian Dream party's government in Tbilisi has recently reestablished economic and other limited ties with Moscow despite a continued cutoff in formal diplomatic relations. Naval News said the craft had gone \"missing\" after being seen on June 28 at its home port of Novorossiisk, about 370 kilometers northwest of Ochamchire, which is in the region of Abkhazia. The Russian-backed separatists in Abkhazia announced in October 2023 that a deal had been signed to establish a Russian naval base at Ochamchire. Georgia's Foreign Ministry immediately condemned the plan as a \"blatant violation\" of Georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity. The separatists then announced in January that construction had begun on the base. Georgia is not a member of the European Union or NATO, though the military alliance calls Tbilisi one of its \"closest partners\" as it aspires for membership. Moscow has repeatedly criticized the NATO and EU membership aspirations of Georgia and other former Soviet republics, and in Georgia's case has kept Russian troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In November 2023, dozens of Georgian lawmakers appealed in a public statement to NATO and the European Union for condemnation of Russia's \"occupation, militarization, and other actions aimed at annexation of the occupied regions of Georgia.\" Tbilisi's candidacy for EU membership has been stalled by the recent passage of so-called \"foreign agent\" legislation seemingly modeled on laws used by Russian authorities to silence dissent and civil society. The U.S. military last week postponed \"indefinitely\" military exercises planned with Georgia for July 25-August 6 over what it said were \"false accusations\" leveled against the United States by Tbilisi. In the wake of the passage of the \"foreign agent\" legislation, U.S. officials said they were conducting a comprehensive review of Washington’s relations with Georgia.",

Sajak will be returning to television as host of the upcoming season of Celebrity Wheel of Fortune, which premieres on October 7. According to a press release from ABC, this is the beloved game show host’s “final spin” on the franchise. PEOPLE has reached out to Sony Pictures Entertainment for additional comment. This news comes just one month after Sajak’s last episode of his long-running hosting gig on Wheel of Fortune aired in early June. He had been on the show for 41 seasons — since 1981 — when he stepped in to replace former host of five-years Chuck Woolery. When introducing himself to viewers at the time, Sajak, 77, immediately gave a glimpse into the humor fans would later know him for. \"Please do not adjust your sets at home, Chuck Woolery has not shrunk,\" he joked, poking fun at the height difference between him and his predecessor. From then until last June, Sajak was the face of the family favorite game show. When he decided it was time to retire, he took to X to announce the decision. \"Well, the time has come. I’ve decided that our 41st season, which begins in September, will be my last,\" he wrote. \"It’s been a wonderful ride, and I’ll have more to say in the coming months. Many thanks to you all. (If nothing else, it’ll keep the clickbait sites busy!)\" Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. While Sajak wraps up with Celebrity Wheel of Fortune, Ryan Seacrest will be taking over for him on Wheel of Fortune. Following the news of Seacrest's new gig, the longtime radio personality wrote a sweet message for Sajak on Instagram. “Pat, congratulations on an incredible run with Wheel of Fortune!” Seacrest began his caption alongside a photograph of himself, Sajak and fellow co-host Vanna White. “Your dedication, charm, and wit have made the show a beloved part of American television for decades,\" he continued. \"Your partnership with Vanna has been nothing short of iconic, and together, you’ve created countless wonderful memories for viewers.” Sajak has since ushered Seacrest into the role in a teaser for the next season. After telling Seacrest “the contestants are going to love you,” he offered a look into what he can expect from the position. “I think what you are going to enjoy most is meeting the players and getting to know the audience at home,” Sajak told him, later adding, “People love this show — they come up every day and thank us for a half hour where they can watch it with the whole family,” he shares.",

                    "text": "Just when you thought he was out, he’s back — for a short while. Although Pat Sajak retired in June after a record breaking stretch of over four decades hosting “Wheel of Fortune,” he will return to host the upcoming season of “Celebrity Wheel of Fortune” premiering October 7. According to an ABC press release, this is his “final spin” on the franchise. He is only finishing his run for the show and not returning for more full-time hosting, the Post has learned. This news comes just one month after Sajak, 77, retired, with fanfare. The notoriously snarky game show host bade farewell to “Wheel of Fortune” on June 7 after hosting the famous game show for more than 8,000 episodes across 41 seasons. Sajak, who will be replaced by Ryan Seacrest on the main “Wheel of Fortune” show, ended his final episode with footage from his 1981 debut, and revealed “Chicago, Illinois” as the first puzzle answer — a possible nod to his hometown. A round was cut from the program to make room for Sajak’s goodbye message, but he gave each contestant $5,000 to make up for it. “Well, the time has come to say goodbye,” Sajak said on-air. “It’s been an incredible privilege to be invited into millions of homes night after night, year after year, decade after decade.” Sajak said he was proud of making the show “a safe place for family fun. No social issues, no politics, nothing embarrassing, I hope. Just a game.” In an additional video before his final episode aired, Sajak addressed fans directly in the camera. “Well, the time has come to say goodbye,” he began. “I have a few thanks and acknowledgments before I go, and I want to start with all of you watching out there. It’s been an incredible privilege to be invited into millions of homes night after night, year after year, decade after decade.” Sajak added, “Kids learned their letters, where people from other countries honed their English skills, where families came together along with friends and neighbors, and entire generations,” he added. “What an honor to play even a small part in all of that. Thank you for allowing me into your lives.” He also bade goodbye on camera to his co-host, Vanna White, 67. “Finally, to my professional other half,” he said. “We’ve seen a lot of changes in our lives over the years but we’ve always been there for each other,” he gushed. “While I’ll very much miss working with her, I take solace that we live about five miles apart. So we’ll see plenty of each other.”",

                    "text": "A bipartisan group of senators on Wednesday launched a renewed effort to ban members of Congress from trading stock. \"Congress should not be here to make a buck,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said at a press conference Wednesday on Capitol Hill. \"There is no reason why members of Congress ought to be profiting off of the information that only they get.\" The proposal is the latest chapter in a years-long saga in Congress to pass regulations that limit lawmakers' ability to buy and sell stocks. And it will be the first of these to get formal consideration by a Senate committee — in this case the Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee on July 24. Ethics experts say that members of Congress have access to so much information in the course of their work that is not available to the public, that they have an unfair investing advantage. Wednesday's amendment to an existing stock trading ban bill would immediately forbid members of Congress, the president and the vice president from purchasing stocks and other covered investments. It would also give lawmakers 90 days to sell their stocks. Sens. Hawley, Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., Jeff Merkley, D-Or., and Gary Peters, D-Mi. negotiated and announced the new details. If passed, the bill would also prohibit lawmakers' spouses and dependent children from trading stocks, beginning March 2027. Also starting that year, the U.S. president, vice president and all members of Congress would have to divest from any covered investments. The penalty for violating the divestment mandate, as proposed by the senators, would cost a lawmaker the greater amount of either their monthly salary, or 10% of the value of each covered asset in violation. The effort to bar members of Congress from trading stocks has been an uphill battle since at least the start of the Biden administration. Sen. Ossoff first introduced a ban in 2021 and put his own stock portfolio in a blind trust as an example. The effort was turbocharged by disclosures that several senators made very profitable trades in the earliest days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when members of Congress were getting classified briefings that warned of how disastrous the virus could be for the U.S. economy. The FBI launched insider trading investigations into three senators, but eventually ended them without criminal charges. The effort picked up more steam ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, after former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dropped her opposition to it. Pelosi's husband is a multimillionaire investor Paul Pelosi, who regularly makes large and profitable stock trades. The then-Speaker had previously written off the trading ban as a misguided effort to prevent lawmakers from participating in the \"free market economy.\"",

The proposed bill comes amid bipartisan calls for the practice to be stopped, given accusations that elected officials might be using privileged knowledge to make profitable trades. The investments that the people covered in the bill would be banned from trading include securities, commodities, futures, options, trusts, and other comparable holdings. Sens. Gary Peters (D-MI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Josh Hawley (R-MO), and Jon Ossoff (D-GA) are behind the plan. “Americans deserve to have confidence that their federal elected officials are making decisions that are in the best interest of the American public and not in the interest of any personal finances,” Peters said Wednesday, according to Politico. The law would go into effect as soon as the president signs it into law for members of Congress, the president, and the vice president, but it wouldn’t be effective until 2027 for their spouses and dependents. There will also be a 90-day “cooling-off period” for such trades from the covered people once they leave office. Violations of the divestment requirements will result in penalties.

Today, after leading intensive bipartisan negotiations, I can report progress toward this necessary reform,” Ossoff said in a press release. “Georgians overwhelmingly agree: Members of Congress should not be playing the stock market while we make Federal policy and have extraordinary access to confidential information. We still have a long way to go to pass this bill, but today’s bipartisan announcement is a major step forward.” Sen. Ossoff Announces Bipartisan Progress to Ban Congressional Stock Tradingwww.youtube.com The proposal also calls for steeper penalties for violating financial disclosure law. Failure to divest would result in a fine of the value of the member’s monthly salary or 10% of the value of the assets in violation, whichever is greater, NPR reported. Currently, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, which was passed by Congress in 2012 to defend against conflicts of interest, curb insider trading and enhance public transparency, assesses a $200 fine for violations of the law — which is often waived. The STOCK Act requires members of Congress to publicly report — within 45 days — most purchases, sales and exchanges of stocks, bonds, commodity futures, securities and cryptocurrencies. Raw Story has found that at least 51 members of the 118th Congress have violated the STOCK Act. Numerous bills have previously been introduced over the past two congressional sessions that would at least in part ban stock trading by members of Congress and their spouses or require stricter punishments for violators. Such bills include the Ban Conflicted Trading Act, the Ban Stock Trading for Government Officials Act — which Ossoff sponsored, the Bipartisan Restoring Faith in Government Act, the TRUST in Congress Act and the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act. None of these bills have yet been voted upon by either the U.S. House or Senate. Peters is chairman of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Hawley and Ossoff are members of the committee. Ossoff and Merkley were unavailable for an immediate interview. The congressional offices for Peters and Hawley did not respond to Raw Story’s interview request by the time of publication.",

                    "text": "By Daphne Psaledakis and Humeyra Pamuk WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The first batch of U.S.-built F-16 fighter jets are already being transferred to Ukraine from Denmark and the Netherlands and will be flying over Ukrainian skies this summer, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday. Blinken, speaking at an event on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington, said a robust package for Ukraine will be unveiled over the next couple of days that will build a clear and strong bridge for Ukraine's NATO membership. \"I'm also pleased to announce that as we speak, the transfer of F-16 jets is underway, coming from Denmark, coming from the Netherlands,\" Blinken said. \"And those jets... will be flying in the skies of Ukraine this summer to make sure that Ukraine can continue to effectively defend itself against the Russian aggression.\" Reinforcing air defenses has been crucial for Ukraine as it fights a Russian invasion. Moscow renewed its aerial assaults on Ukraine's national power grid in the spring, causing sweeping blackouts. F-16s have been on Ukraine's wish list for a long time because of their destructive power and global availability. The fighter jet is equipped with a 20mm cannon and can carry bombs, rockets and missiles. \"We are preparing to meet modern fighter jets in the Ukrainian skies,\" Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said in a post on X after meeting with his Dutch and Danish counterparts. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week that he wanted to double Ukraine's air defense capacity over the summer and that his country needed at least seven additional Patriot systems to protect itself. NATO members have announced the delivery of five additional Patriot and other strategic air defense systems to help Ukraine. Still more aid announcements were expected at this week's summit in Washington, which marks the alliance's 75th anniversary. A joint statement from the leaders of the United States, Denmark and the Netherlands said the Danish and Dutch governments were in the process of donating American-made F-16s to Ukraine. Denmark has committed to donate 19 jets in total, while the Netherlands has promised to deliver 24 aircraft. Both countries have been driving forces behind an international coalition to supply Ukraine with F-16s. Norway also said on Wednesday that it would donate six F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine and that the deliveries were planned to start this year.

                    "text": "WASHINGTON—Ukraine is in the process of getting fighter jets from Denmark and Holland, announced U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. At the annual NATO Summit on July 10, Mr. Blinken said that U.S.-made F-16s are being transferred from those alliance members to Kyiv “as we speak.” This development was announced a day after President Biden said that some NATO members, including the United States, will be sending Ukraine five missile defense systems as it has been fending off Russia’s invasion for more than two years. The summit will also feature a tighter commitment to Ukraine’s joining NATO, which consists of 32 members. Ukraine already has been using F-16s in its war against Russia. Norway, which is one of the world’s biggest donors to Ukraine, will donate six F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv, Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store announced on July 10. No date was announced as to when Norway will donate the six jets, but Mr. Gahr Store said, “We aim to start the donations during 2024.” He said Kyiv’s “ability to defend itself against attacks from the air is absolutely crucial in its defensive battle against Russia.” Last year, Mr. Gahr Store said during a trip to Kyiv that Norway would donate F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine but didn’t specify how many. After 42 years of service, the Nordic NATO member phased out its aging fleet of F-16 fighters in 2021 and is replacing them with new F-35A Joint Strike Fighter jets. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Moscow could consider launching strikes at facilities in NATO countries if they host the warplanes used in Ukraine. “If they are stationed at air bases outside the Ukrainian borders and used in combat, we will have to see how and where to strike the assets used in combat against us,” Mr. Putin said last year. “It poses a serious danger of NATO being further drawn into the conflict.” In March, the Russian leader again warned Ukraine’s Western allies against providing air bases from where the F-16s could launch sorties against the Kremlin’s forces. Those bases would become a “legitimate target,” he said. “F-16s are capable of carrying nuclear weapons, and we will also need to take that into account while organizing our combat operations,” Mr. Putin stated. Ukraine has struck back with regular missile and drone attacks on Moscow-occupied territories and areas inside Russia. The United States and other NATO allies have responded to the latest Russian offensive by allowing Ukraine to use weapons they deliver to Kyiv to carry out limited attacks inside Russia. The decision could impede Moscow’s ability to concentrate its troops for a bigger offensive near Kharkiv and other border areas. The United States has not always been in favor of Ukraine getting fighter jets. Long shadowing the Biden administration’s calculation were worries that such a move could escalate tensions with Russia. U.S. officials also argued that learning to fly and logistically support the advanced F-16 would be difficult and time-consuming. However, the U.S. position shifted to supporting Ukraine in getting fighter jets.",

                    "text": "Travis Kelce’s 2024 Super Bowl suite tab for Taylor Swift and their families didn’t come cheap. The Kansas City Chiefs tight end suggested a hefty price tag for the private box seats in a conversation with the San Francisco 49ers’ George Kittle in an episode of Netflix’s “Receiver” that debuted on Wednesday. “They’re f–king three million dollars,” Kelce said. Kittle apparently decided that number was too big to pull the trigger. “It’s just like, ‘You guys are gonna be fine,’” Kittle said of his family. In the days leading up to the big game, Kelce joked on his “New Heights” podcast that he is “counting how much money I’m spending on this damn Super Bowl for family and friends to come” and “just making sure I’m on top of those finances and losing all this money.” TMZ reported at the time that the 34-year-old would be taking care of the bill for his supporters’ suite at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. Kelce purchased the suite last-minute after his mother, Donna Kelce, floated the possibility of sitting in the stands on the “Today” show on the Wednesday before the Super Bowl. “Well, you can understand that the boxes in Vegas are multi-million dollars, so I have a feeling I’m not in a box,” she said. “I have a feeling I am in the stands. … As far as I know, I’m in the stands with everyone else because it is a pricey Super Bowl.” While Kelce splurged on the expensive suite, one player was able to get a bargain on one, according to the pair of tight ends. Christian McCaffrey, Kittle said, got a “nice deal” on a suite for his now-wife Olivia Culpo and their loved ones. Kelce’s costly setup wasn’t short on star talent, though. Swift and Donna were joined by a long list of A-list stars, including Travis’ brother, Jason Kelce, Blake Lively, Ice Spice, Keleigh Teller, who is married to actor Miles Teller, model Cara Delevingne and Patrick Mahomes’ wife, Brittany.",

                    "text": "Super Bowl suites don’t come cheap, even if you’re playing in the game. In an episode of Netflix’s new series Receiver, which premiered July 10, Travis Kelce seemingly revealed how much Taylor Swift’s Super Bowl suite cost — and it had a *hefty* price tag. In the episode, Kelce was filmed having a conversation with George Kittle, who plays for the San Fransisco 49ers. (Reminder: The Chiefs played the 49ers in the 2024 Super Bowl.) During their convo, Kittle explained that his family was planning on sitting in the stands — not a suite — for the big game. Kelce responded, per Page Six, “Because they’re f*cking three million dollars?” Swift sat in a VIP box for the Super Bowl, along with plenty of other celebs like Blake Lively, Ice Spice, and Miles and Keleigh Teller. Paul McCartney even stopped by to say hello at one point. Plus, Lana Del Rey was sitting just below Swift’s seat. Swift’s parents (Scott and Andrea) and Kelce’s family (Donna, Ed, Jason, and Kylie) were also there to show support and watch the game. As expensive as the suite was, Kelce was definitely able to afford it. With his new contract, signed in April 2024, the Chiefs tight end will earn $34.25 million over two years, per ESPN. The contract made him the highest-paid tight end ever. After signing the updated deal, Kelce expressed his gratitude during a May 1 episode of his New Heights podcast. “I'm so fricking thankful to Brett Veach [Chiefs general manager], Mark Donovan [Chiefs president], coach Reid — Big Red, I love you, big guy — and obviously Clark Hunt [Chiefs owner,” he said at the time, per the NFL. “I'm gonna love the next two years playing here in Kansas City, and we'll see what happens after that, but I am so excited and so thankful to this organization for getting it done and making me feel appreciated and compensated the right way,” Kelce continued. “On top of that, I got to move the needle for the tight end room. It's everyone else's job to go out there and keep making that tight end AAV [average annual value] number go up and up with every single contract that's better than mine in the future.”",

                    "text": "Jon Bon Jovi is mourning the death of his beloved mother who died Tuesday at age 83. The rocker’s mom, Carol Biongovi, died at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, N.J., just three days before she was set to turn 84. “Our mother was a force to be reckoned with,” the “Livin’ on a Prayer” hitmaker, 62, told People in a statement on behalf of his family. “Her spirit and can-do attitude shaped this family. She will be greatly missed.” Her cause of death was not immediately announced. Carol, who was born in Erie, Penn., founded the official fan club for her son’s rock band, Bon Jovi, in the 1980s. Before that, she served as a US Marine, where she met her future husband, John Bongiovi, Sr. The pair later moved to Sayreville, N.J. and welcomed three boys: Jon, Anthony and Matthew. Speaking to The Big Issue in November 2020, the “You Give Love a Bad Name” hitmaker credited his parents with giving him “the ability to make the dream reality.” “Even if you truly weren’t any good at your craft, if you believed you were, you could work on it,” he said at the time. “As I got older I realized that was a great gift that I got from my folks. They truly believed in the John Kennedy mantra of going to the moon. ‘Yeah, of course you can go to the moon. Just go, Johnny.’ And there I went.” The rocker also praised his parents for supporting his dream of becoming a rock star. “They were always supportive of me, which in retrospect, was incredible,” he said. “Because I could get home at one or two in the morning, and have to still be in school by eight o’clock. They just said, show up on time for school, you know that is your responsibility, but pursue your dream.” Carol is survived by her three sons and their wives, as well as eight grandchildren. Carol’s death comes less than two months after the rocker’s son, Jake Bongiovi, secretly tied the knot with “Stranger Things” actress Millie Bobby Brown. Bon Jovi confirmed reports of the pair’s private nuptials during an appearance on BBC’s “The One Show” in May. “They’re great, they’re absolutely fantastic, it was a very small family wedding and the bride looked gorgeous and Jake is happy as can be,” he shared.",

                    "text": "Jon Bon Jovi paid loving tribute to the Bongiovi family matriarch on Wednesday (July 10), a day after his mother, Carol Bongiovi, died at 83. The Bon Jovi front man’s mom died of undisclosed causes on Tuesday (July 9) at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, N.J. just a three days short of her 84th birthday. “Our mother was a force to be reckoned with, her spirit and can-do attitude shaped this family. She will be greatly missed,” Bon Jovi, 62, said in a statement from the family; Bon Jovi (born John Francis Bongiovi Jr.) has two younger brothers, Anthony and fellow musician Matthew Bongiovi. In addition to being a former Playboy playmate and florist, Carol was married to barber and fellow Marine veteran John Francis Bongiovi Sr. and operated her son’s fan club for many years. According to an obituary from the Holmdel Funeral Home, the family matriarch enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1959, where she met her future husband. The couple moved to Sayreville, N.J. after their hitch in the military, where they raised their family before moving to Holmdel, N.J. The woman affectionally referred to as “Mom Jovi” by the Garden State legends’ fans made a cameo, along with his dad, in the singer’s 2021 “Story of Love” video. In the visual, Jon strummed an acoustic guitar in front of a wall of family photos — including a giant black and white snap of his folks with their eldest son — as he sang about familia love. “Father love daughters like mothers love sons,” he sang. “They’ve been writing our story before there was one/ From the day you arrive/ ‘Til you walk, ‘Til you run/ There is nothing but pride, there is nothing but love/ They can offer advice that you don’t wanna hear/ Words that cut like a knife and still ring in your ear.” In an interview with the Big Issue in 2020, Bon Jovi, 62, spoke lovingly of the lessons he learned from his parents, especially their unwavering support after his admittedly “terrible” first talent show performance as a teen. “What I got from my parents was the ability to make the dream reality. They always instilled that confidence in their kids which, in retrospect, I realize was so incredibly valuable,” he told the mag at the time. “Because even if you truly weren’t any good at your craft, if you believed you were, you could work on it. As I got older I realized that was a great gift that I got from my folks. They truly believed in the John Kennedy mantra of going to the moon. ‘Yeah, of course you can go to the moon. Just go, Johnny.’ And there I went.” Carol Bongiovi was born Carol Sharkey in Erie, Pennsylvania on July, 12, 1940 and is survived by her husband of 63 years, their three sons and daughters-in-law as well as eight grandchildren.",

A representative for Bon Jovi confirmed the news to Entertainment Weekly and provided a statement from the musician on behalf of the family that said, \"Our mother was a force to be reckoned with. Her spirit and can-do attitude shaped this family. She will be greatly missed.\" A cause of death was not disclosed. In addition to being Bon Jovi's mom, the woman born Carol Starkey was the founder of her son's eponymous band's fan club, as well as a former Playboy bunny, U.S. Marine, and entrepreneur. Born and raised in Erie, Pa., she enlisted in the Marine Corps at 19. During her duty, she met her husband, John Bongiovi, Sr., and the couple later settled down in Sayreville, N.J., where they raised three sons. Their romance takes center stage in the music video for the 2020 Bon Jovi song \"Story of Love,\" which features the frontman performing the track in front of a wall covered in family heirlooms and photographs of the couple taken in their youth. Bon Jovi shared a snippet of the video Wednesday on Instagram and wrote, \"Momma, we carry you with us always.\" Carol Bongiovi was always an avid supporter of her son's dream to be a musician. She gave him his first acoustic guitar when he was 7, according to Laura Jackson's 2004 biography of the artist. A true entrepreneur, Bongiovi also operated the official Bon Jovi fan club out of her Woodbridge, N.J., flower shop and would often phone local newspapers to tell them about her son's musical talents. She was also \"one of the original [Playboy] bunnies,\" Bon Jovi recalled during a 2006 interview with Larry King. \"I did go there as a kid,\" he said of the nightclub. \"Oh God, did I have the stories and the pictures. They had their little outfit and my dad was like this hip cat because he was married to a Playboy bunny.\" Bongiovi is survived by her husband of 63 years, their three sons, three daughters-in-law, and eight grandchildren. Funeral services will be private, but those seeking to leave condolences may leave a message on her Holmdel Funeral Home tribute page.",

                    "text": "Derrick White’s dream summer just got even more spectacular. After winning his first NBA championship last month and then signing a four-year, $125.9 contract extension with the Celtics, White now can add “Olympian” to his resume. The 30-year-old guard on Wednesday was added to Team USA’s roster for the 2024 Paris Olympics, according to multiple reports. He replaced Kawhi Leonard, who withdrew from the team due to injury. White’s addition meant Boston players now make up one-quarter of the star-studded 12-man squad, as fellow Celtics champions Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday both were selected to the initial Olympic roster. Tatum is coming off three consecutive first-team All-NBA seasons and led the Celtics in points, rebounds and assists during their playoff run before signing the largest contract in NBA history (five years, $314 million) earlier this month. White and Holiday are ultra-versatile veterans who formed the league’s best defensive backcourt this past season. Both also shot better than 40% from three during the postseason, ranking fourth and fifth among the 55 playoff participants who averaged at least 4.5 3-point attempts per game. White, who previously represented the U.S. at the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup, recently told the Herald he’d gladly accept an Olympic invite. While he might be the least flashy name on a roster loaded with All-Stars and future Hall of Famers, his unselfishness should make him a valuable depth piece for head coach Steve Kerr. “Any chance you can play for your country and just try to win a gold medal, I think that would definitely be something that, if Kawhi (can’t play) and they ask me, I’ll definitely be looking forward to,” White said. Leonard had been participating in Team USA’s training camp in Las Vegas — where it practiced against a select side featuring Celtics backup Payton Pritchard — and wanted to play in Paris, according to a statement from USA Basketball. But both the federation and Leonard’s team, the Los Angeles Clippers, preferred he sit out as he recovers from a lingering knee injury that sidelined him for four of LA’s six playoff games. “Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas,” the statement read. “He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it’s in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.” The U.S. is scheduled to play five exhibition games before departing for France, facing Canada in Vegas on Wednesday night, Australia and Serbia in Abu Dhabi next week, and then South Sudan and Germany in London. Olympic group play then opens with a game against Serbia on July 28, followed by matchups with South Sudan on July 31 and Puerto Rico on Aug. 3 before the knockout rounds begin. The men’s gold and bronze medal games will be played on Saturday, Aug. 10 at Paris’s Bercy Arena. The Americans enter the Games as heavy favorites after winning gold each of the last four Summer Olympics and seven of the last eight. Tatum and Holiday both were part of the team that topped the podium in Tokyo in 2020.",

                    "text": "The recently-crowned champion Celtics will have one more representative at the Olympics playing for Team USA. Derrick White, 30, is joining the U.S. according to a team announcement on Wednesday afternoon. The news follows a Team USA statement earlier in the day announcing that Clippers forward Kawhi Leonard — originally named to the roster — will not play at the Summer Games as he works his way back from a knee injury sustained at the end of the NBA regular season. “Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas,” USA basketball said in the statement. “He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it’s in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.” The addition of White gives Team USA a trio of Celtics, with White joining teammates Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday. Fresh off winning a title, it gives the Boston contingent the chance to achieve wins in multiple competitions in only a few months. White’s previous experience with the national team came at the 2019 FIBA World Cup, though it ended in disappointing fashion as the U.S. lost back-to-back games against France and Serbia, eventually finishing seventh. Tatum and Holiday were both members of the gold medal run by Team USA at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The United States are winners of the last four consecutive gold medals in men’s basketball. They are the favorites to do so once again in Paris, but will face difficult competition from several nations, including Serbia, Germany (which defeated the U.S. at the 2023 FIBA World Cup), and hosts France.",

Leonard, who missed 12 of the Clippers' final 14 games in 2023-24 because of right knee issues, was set to make his Olympic basketball debut. White, 30, averaged 15.2 points, 5.2 assists and 4.2 rebounds per game over 73 starts last season for the NBA champion Boston Celtics. He is on track to make his Olympic debut in Paris.

                    "text": "LAS VEGAS — Derrick White of the NBA champion Boston Celtics has replaced the Los Angeles Clippers’ Kawhi Leonard on the U.S. team for the Paris Olympics, USA Basketball said Wednesday in the first shakeup to a roster that was announced in the spring. Leonard missed 12 of the Los Angeles Clippers’ final 14 games this past season with right knee inflammation, though he said in recent days that he felt fine and the knee was doing well. USA Basketball said it, along with the Clippers, made the decision on Leonard’s status for Paris. “Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas,” USA Basketball said in a statement. “He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it’s in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.” White averaged 15.2 points and 5.2 assists for the Celtics this past season. His selection gives Boston three of the 12 players on the U.S. roster; Celtics teammates Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday also are Paris-bound. White is expected to be in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, later this week to join the U.S. squad. The team will fly to Abu Dhabi from Las Vegas on Thursday and is scheduled to practice there Saturday ahead of exhibition games against Australia on July 15 and Serbia on July 17. “I am happy to announce that Derrick will compete at his first Olympic Games on the heels of a championship season in Boston,” USA Basketball Managing Director Grant Hill said. “We look forward to him joining the team in the coming days as we continue preparations for Paris. “I want to thank Kawhi for his commitment to the USA Men’s National Team,” Hill added. “He earned the opportunity to represent the United States, but USA Basketball and Clippers leadership felt it’s important to allow Kawhi to prepare for the NBA season.” White – a second-team All-Defensive selection after this past NBA season, meaning he’ll clearly take some of the on-ball defending duties that the Olympic team likely envisioned Leonard having – has some USA Basketball experience, including being part of the 2019 World Cup team that finished seventh in China. He and the Celtics agreed on a four-year extension worth nearly $126 million after the playoff run, one in which he led Boston with 65 made 3-pointers on a team-best 40.4% shooting from beyond the arc. Leonard is a two-time NBA champion, six-time All-Star and six-time All-NBA player, but injury issues have been a recurring theme in his career. USA Basketball had monitored him closely in recent weeks, making sure he was doing well enough to be on the court after his season with the Clippers ended prematurely. He has missed 256 regular-season games over the last seven years, including all of the 2021-22 season with knee trouble. He appeared in 68 games this past season for the Clippers, his most since playing in 74 for San Antonio during the 2016-17 season. “This is just my journey,” Leonard said earlier this week, discussing his injuries. “I can’t lay out the perfect script for me. Last year I tried to play as much as possible, felt great and at a certain period of time I couldn’t go. I tried the best that I could, but it’s just my journey. I don’t want to be in a situation that (I’m) in, but I’ve got to take it for what it is. And a lot of people are watching, supporters or doubters. But I motivate a lot of people, so I’ve got to keep doing what I’m doing.” Leonard – part of a 592-person Olympic team formally named by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee earlier Wednesday – had said earlier this week that his knee was fine and he was able to resume on-court training about three weeks ago to get ready for the Games. “I’m ready to go,” Leonard said then. “I’m playing now so, I’m happy.” A couple of days later, hours before the first U.S. exhibition game against Canada and one day before the team departs for Abu Dhabi – the first of two international stops for more games and practices before arriving in France for the Olympics – Leonard was gone. Leonard’s departure leaves the U.S., at least until White arrives, with 10 available players. Kevin Durant will not play against Canada because of a calf strain and could not compete in the team’s four-day training camp in Las Vegas that ended Tuesday. USA Basketball is working under the expectation that Durant will be ready for increasingly more on-court activity in the coming days. Leonard had been invited to be part of USA Basketball teams in the past and had to decline for various reasons, primarily injury issues or long playoff runs. “I always wanted to play against other talent overseas or just other basketball styles and players,” Leonard said. “It is one of the reasons why I play the game.” « Previous",

                    "text": "July 10 (UPI) -- More than 1.6 million homes in Texas still had no power by Wednesday morning in the middle of sweltering heat in the aftermath of Hurricane Beryl as it still could be several more days until power is fully restored in some places. President Joe Biden on Tuesday granted a federal emergency disaster declaration to help speed recovery efforts in 121 Texas counties that were affected by Hurricane Beryl. Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott is away on a diplomatic mission. The declaration will reimburse Texas up to 75% of recovery efforts. According to the National Weather Service, a heat advisory is currently in effect for all of Southeast Texas where a large part of the state is still with no power. The heat index is expected to feel 106 degrees Fahrenheit. \"With power outages continuing across [Southeast Texas,] the lack of air conditioning will aggravate the risk of heat-related illnesses as high temperatures warm into the lower and mid-90s,\" NWS in Houston advised. CenterPoint Energy, the Houston area's main energy supplier, said Tuesday night that power had already been restored to 850,000 customers which was one-third of the 2.26 million customers who had been impacted in Beryl's path. \"Right behind public safety is restoring city and county services with the highest priority of electricity and energy,\" Houston Mayor John Whitmire said Tuesday. \"We're doing everything we possibly can to see that your electricity is restored.\" CenterPoint officials said power would be restored to 1 million customers by Wednesday, according to Houston Chronicle. The company's website showed 1,357,077 customers affected by outages just before noon Wednesday with 11,653 active outages as 563,743 customers got power in the last 24 hours. More than 1.2 million of CenterPoint's more than 2.1 million Harris County customers reportedly still had no power by Tuesday afternoon as the company reported the \"main elements\" of its energy systems was intact following the hurricane. However, it claimed work crews had already walked 4,500 miles by foot to check circuits using helicopter and drone surveillance in preparation for the large task ahead. \"We have made solid progress and exceeded the number of customer restorations following Hurricane Ike,\" Lynnae Wilson, CenterPoint's Senior Vice President of Electric Business, told multiple news sources on Tuesday. \"But we have a lot of important work ahead, especially in the hardest-hit areas where the work will be more complex and time-consuming.\" Interactive maps provided by CenterPoint, which pointed to delays in reporting, indicated how the effort to restore is on an active \"Step 2\" phase. \"We know we have a lot of customers counting on us to do our jobs as safely and quickly as possible, and that will continue to be our highest priority,\" Wilson stated Tuesday. According to the map, work crews appear to be in the very active stages between assessing Beryl's damage and the scope of work needed with some already in active repairing stages, along with scattered power outages shown in the area. \"Please be prepared for restoration efforts to take several days,\" the company map advised. Texans have in recent years gone through a pattern of power outages and other electric grid issues as climate patterns change as both heat and freezing weather take their toll on the Texas power grid. Extreme heat knocked out power July 2022 during one Houston area news station's weather forecast. Meanwhile, the state suffered catastrophic power issues when 200 people died after the grid failed in February 2021. Then in May and June that year, the state's system was impacted by widespread solar farm shutdowns. Texas citizens have often been asked to conserve and cut back on their own electricity use as punishing heat wave like now across Texas drive record-high power demand. It arrives as the Biden administration in May unveiled an '\"unprecedented\" 21-state initiative to modernize the ailing U.S. power grid in a move Texas opted not to take part in.",

                    "text": "More than 1.6 million people in southeast Texas are still without power two days after being hit by Hurricane Beryl and are suffering under the intense Texas heat. While efforts to restore power are underway, downed trees and persistent flooding continue to hinder progress. On July 9, President Joe Biden approved Acting Texas Gov. Dan Patrick’s disaster declaration for Texas, which will provide federal funding and resources through FEMA. President Biden also addressed the intense heat. “The greatest concern right now is the power outages and extreme heat that is impacting Texans,” the president said in a statement. On July 10, at least one death from heatstroke was confirmed by Matagorda County Judge Bobby Seiferman. Judge Seiferman said it was the only storm-related death reported so far in his county. Fatality reports continue to come in, and Mr. Patrick told the media the count is “somewhere in the range of nine, 10, or 11 ... that we’re aware of.” He said exact numbers will continue to vary, with some deaths categorized later as being due to the storm. Most of the deaths in Texas occurred in the Houston, Harris County area. One death was previously reported in Louisiana. Cooling and distribution centers continue to be set up across the affected cities. At least 14 cooling centers spread across Houston, with churches and charitable organizations also stepping up to provide food, water, and ice to those in need. However, not everyone has been charitable during the outages. Two businesses were targeted. The suspects were arrested immediately. Mr. Garcia was shot in the leg and transported to the Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center. The latest report said he is in a stable condition. However, Mr. Patrick told reporters that the hospital was unable to give the police officer a room for the night. Hospitals across the region remain overcrowded and officials said they are unable to discharge patients to their homes without power. A field medical hospital is being set up that Mr. Patrick said will eventually hold 250 beds. “It’s in the patient’s best interest not to send them to a place that doesn’t have power [as] they can’t keep their medications refrigerated,” Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said. Mr. Kidd said Emergency Management was providing the additional facility “to ease the burden on ... hospitals right now.”",

                    "text": "The future of phones just got slightly more expensive...again. Samsung is raising the prices of its foldable and flippable phones with the release of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6. The devices will now cost $1,900 and $1,100, respectively, making them $100 more than their predecessors. Samsung debuted the handsets Wednesday during its Unpacked event, along with other gadgets like the Galaxy Ring and Galaxy Buds 3. The Galaxy Z Fold and Flip 6 incorporate Galaxy AI, the phone maker's suite of AI-powered software features. The features are designed to simplify various tasks, like translating conversations and editing photos. The latest Galaxy Z phones also come equipped with the Google Gemini app, offering an AI-powered assistant to help with writing, planning or to answer your questions more thoroughly. Users can also take advantage of Circle to Search for quicker results on a webpage, social media post or photo. The phones also feature upgraded hardware. Samsung says this is the \"slimmest and lightest Galaxy Z series ever,\" and is also more durable. The inner folding screens are improved, with \"enhanced layers on the main screen help to improve the crease while maintaining strength,\" the company added in a press release. This host of new features, to Samsung, seems to justify a higher price tag. But that $100 hike adds to an already prohibitive cost for a lot of consumers. The uptick also aligns with price increases on other recent devices from phone makers like Samsung and Apple. The Galaxy S24 Ultra, for instance, costs $100 more than last year's Galaxy S23 Ultra, and Apple's iPhone 15 Pro Max also starts at $100 more than the 14 Pro Max, since the company eliminated the lower-priced 128GB storage option. And with the entry price for many flagship phones looming around $1,000, any increase can feel like a major one. Stay tuned for CNET's first takes and reviews of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 to see how our experts feel about the host of new features and updates coming to the series. In the meantime, the Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 are available to preorder now, and will hit shelves (and mailboxes) July 24.",

                    "text": "PRE-ORDER NOW: Samsung's two newest foldable smartphones — the Galaxy Z Fold6 and Z Flip6 — are both available to pre-order as of July 10. They'll officially release on July 24, and start at $1,899.99 and $1,099.99, respectively. Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked press conference wrapped up Wednesday, and with it came a slew of new announcements on the brand's latest wearable tech and smartphones, among other things. The company introduced its Galaxy AI tech earlier in 2024, and now it's being brought to its two newest mobile devices — the Galaxy Z Fold6 and Z Flip6. Both of which are already up for preorder, and will officially ship out on July 24. Starting at $1,899.99, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6 is said to have its most advanced and durable display yet, even with fewer layers than the previous generation (which will thankfully make the device much easier to fold up). The maximum brightness of the screen has been upgraded, too, and will be easier to use in direct sunlight without too much glare. Mobile gamers will be happy to learn that the Z Fold6 is ray-tracing-enabled, and the phone's thinner bezels provide more screen real estate than ever. Starting at $1,099.99, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip6 was touted by the company as the slimmest and lightest version of the pint-sized foldable to date, but also the most powerful. The two main upgrades here are the camera and battery. The Z Flip6 features a 50MP wide-sensor lens, and has the ability to use AI tech to enhance your photos — this includes sharpening details, detecting lighting and objects, and helping you take the perfect hands-free group shot. The smartphone now has a 4,000mAh battery compared to 3,700mAh on the Flip5. The brand also says that the Flip6 employs its strongest display and hinge yet. Both handhelds take advantage of Samsung's Galaxy AI suite, including Note Assist, Circle to Search, Composer, live translations, and more. Plus, the Z Fold6 adds in Google's voice-enabled AI assistant, Gemini. Both phones are now available to pre-order, and will officially release on July 24.

Samsung clearly has embraced its purpose of being a compact, creativity-inspiring device with a clamshell design that pays homage to the decades-old flip phones before it.

                    "text": "The House passed a bill 221-198 on Wednesday to require proof of US citizenship when registering to vote — a measure strongly opposed by Democrats and the White House despite proof of non-citizens casting ballots in federal elections. A majority of 216 Republicans and five Democrats moved the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act over the finish line, including swing-district Reps. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), Vicente Gonzalez (D-Texas), Jared Golden (D-Maine) and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.). At least 198 Democrats opposed the measure, and no Republicans. It’s illegal for non-US citizens to vote in federal elections, but that hasn’t stopped hundreds from doing so, state and federal investigations have shown, and thousands from attempting to do so. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) whipped his caucus in opposition to what he called an “extreme MAGA Republican voter suppression bill,” before inaccurately stating: “There is no evidence that has been presented to suggest that undocumented individuals have been participating in federal elections.” The White House also issued a veto threat against the legislation on Monday. “It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in Federal elections—it is a Federal crime punishable by prison and fines,” the White House Office of Management and Budget said in a statement. “Additionally, making a false claim of citizenship or unlawfully voting in an election is punishable by removal from the United States and a permanent bar to admission,” the statement also reads. “This bill would do nothing to safeguard our elections, but it would make it much harder for all eligible Americans to register to vote and increase the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls.” Left-of-center groups like the Campaign Legal Center have further dismissed concerns about the loophole in registration being able to sway elections, but conservatives have remained unconvinced. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who introduced the bill, told The Post and other reporters on Tuesday that the claims it would disenfranchise US voters were “hogwash.” “We’ve seen that Democrats are now trying to abuse this,” Roy said. “And you’ve got, you know, in Oakland, and San Francisco and New York and D.C. and all across the country — Democrats are pushing to allow non-citizens to vote.” “They say — wink, wink — ‘Only in state and local elections,’” he suggested. Johnson’s office released a 21-page white paper on the legislation in June, urging Congress to pass it and thwart potential “foreign election interference” as a result of the record-breaking 6.4 million immigrants who have entered the US and taken up residence since President Biden took office in January 2021. The paper references another effort by Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas) last year to introduce legislation that would provide mass amnesty to migrants — even those who have illegally voted in past elections. “We have so many non-citizens in the country right now that if only one out of 100 of those illegal aliens voted, you’re talking about hundreds of thousands of votes being cast,” Johnson warned in his floor speech, adding that the number could “determine the future of this great Republic.” “As our dear friend, congresswoman [Mariannette] Miller-Meeks will tell you she won her election in 2020 by six votes,” he pointed out, referring to the Iowa Republican’s narrow win over Democrat Rita Hart that year. In the position paper, Johnson’s staff also pointed to an academic study that found non-citizen voter participation “has been large enough to change meaningful election outcomes including Electoral College votes, and Congressional elections.” If the same rate of non-citizen voter participation occurs in November, the paper claims it would be “sufficient enough to determine the outcome of the 2024 Presidential election.” Hans von Spakovsky, a former member of the Federal Election Commission and manager of the Election Law Reform Initiative at the Heritage Foundation, told The Post last month that it was “difficult to predict the actual numbers of aliens that may vote because so many states do absolutely nothing to verify the citizenship of registered voters.” The bill would help that by cleaning up voter rolls in US states by verifying people through federal databases at the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration. Voter rolls have been shown through audits in recent years to contain thousands of non-citizens — including the swing-states of Pennsylvania and Georgia. Under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and welfare offices nationwide are required to hand over voter registration forms in at least 46 states along with applications for driver’s licenses and federal benefit programs. In filling out the federal form, would-be voters only have to make a signed attestation of their citizenship, and in some states must also provide a driver’s license number or the last four digits of their social security number. Only three US states — Tennessee, Virginia and New Mexico — ask for the full social security number. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has expanded access to health care and other federal benefit packages like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, putting more migrants within reach of the forms. It has also provided avenues for asylum seekers, parolees and foreigners present in the US on work visas to obtain social security numbers. Additionally, 19 states and Washington, D.C., allow non-citizens to receive driver’s licenses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a move that Biden supported as a presidential candidate in 2020. “Perhaps the Democrat Party would prefer that we only identify fraudulent voters after the fact but after an election has already decided and the new members are sworn in,” Johnson said before the vote. “That’s not acceptable. That doesn’t instill trust. It doesn’t ensure the integrity of the system.” “Because the Democratic Party has shown time and time again that they want our borders wide open to every country on the planet, and that they want illegal aliens voting in our elections, we now have reached a fateful decision point,” Johnson concluded. “Since our elections are so razor thin, it’s not just our physical safety of our communities that are in jeopardy, it’s also the integrity of the ballot box.”",

                    "text": "WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voter registration, a proposal Republicans have prioritized as an election-year talking point even as research shows noncitizens illegally registering and casting ballots in federal elections is exceptionally rare. The legislation approved largely along partisan lines but with a few Democrats voting in favor, is unlikely to advance through the Democratic-led Senate. The Biden administration also says it’s strongly opposed because it says safeguards already are in place to verify voter eligibility and enforce the law against noncitizen voting. Still, the House vote will give Republicans an opportunity to bring attention to two of their central issues this year – border and election security. It also provides an opportunity to fuel former President Donald Trump’s claims that Democrats have encouraged the surge of migrants so they can register them to vote, which would be illegal. Noncitizens are not allowed to vote in federal elections, nor is it allowed for any statewide elections. Research and audits in several states show there have been incidences of noncitizens who successfully registered to vote and cast ballots, but it happens rarely and is typically by mistake. States have mechanisms to check for it, although there isn’t one standard protocol they all follow. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a key backer of the bill, said in a news conference earlier this week that the Democratic opposition means many Democrats “want illegals to participate in our federal elections; they want them to vote.” During a speech Wednesday, he called the vote a “generation-defining moment.” “If just a small percentage, a fraction of a fraction of all those illegals that Joe Biden has brought in here to vote, if they do vote, it wouldn’t just change one race,” he said. “It might potentially change all of our races.” On his Truth Social platform this week, Trump suggested that Democrats are pushing to give noncitizen migrants the right to vote and urged Republicans to pass the legislation – the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act – or “go home and cry yourself to sleep.” The fixation on noncitizen voting is part of a broader and long-term Trump campaign strategy of casting doubt on the validity of an election should he lose, and he has consistently pushed that narrative during his campaign rallies this year. Last month in Las Vegas, he told supporters, “The only way they can beat us is to cheat.” It also is part of a wider Republican campaign strategy, with GOP lawmakers across the country passing state legislation and putting noncitizen voting measures on state ballots for November. Democrats and voting rights advocates have said the legislation is unnecessary because it’s already a felony for noncitizens to register to vote in federal elections, punishable by fines, prison or deportation. Anyone registering must attest under penalty of perjury that they are a U.S. citizen. Noncitizens also are not allowed to cast ballots at the state level. A handful of municipalities allow them to vote in some local elections. They also have pointed to surveys showing that millions of Americans don’t have easy access to up-to-date documentary proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate, naturalization certificate or passport, and therefore the bill could inhibit U.S. citizen voters who aren’t able to further prove their status. During the Wednesday floor debate, Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, expressed concern that the bill would disenfranchise various American citizens. He mentioned military members stationed abroad who couldn’t show documentary proof of citizenship in person at an election office, as well as married women whose names have changed, Native Americans whose tribal IDs don’t show their place of birth and natural disaster survivors who have lost their documents. Morelle said he doesn’t see the bill as an attempt to maintain voter rolls but as part of larger GOP-led plans to question the validity of the upcoming election. “The false claim that there is a conspiracy to register noncitizens is a pretext for trying to overturn the 2024 election, potentially leading to another tragedy on January 6th, 2025,” he said. Yet Republicans who support the bill say the unprecedented surge of migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border creates too large a risk of noncitizens slipping through the cracks. They could purposely or inadvertently break the law to cast ballots that sway races amid narrow margins in November’s elections. “Every illegal vote cancels out the vote of a legal American citizen,” said Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the Republican chair of the House Administration Committee. If passed, the bill would require noncitizens to be removed from state voter rolls and require new applicants to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship. It also would require states to establish a process for applicants who can’t show proof to provide other evidence beyond their attestation of citizenship, though it’s unclear what that evidence could include. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose recently found 137 suspected noncitizens on the state’s rolls — out of roughly 8 million voters – and said he was taking action to confirm and remove them. In 2022, Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, conducted an audit of his state’s voter rolls specifically looking for noncitizens. His office found that 1,634 had attempted to register to vote over 25 years, but election officials had caught all the applications and none had been able to register. In North Carolina in 2016, an audit of elections found that 41 legal immigrants who had not yet become citizens cast ballots, out of 4.8 million total ballots cast. The votes didn’t make a difference in any of the state’s elections. In a document supporting the bill, Johnson listed other examples of noncitizens who had been removed from the rolls in Boston and Virginia. The elections departments there didn’t immediately answer questions from The Associated Press to verify the claims. Several secretaries of state, interviewed during their summer conference in Puerto Rico this week, said noncitizens attempting to register and vote is not a big problem in their state. Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, a Republican, said that his state already requires photo ID to vote and that most people use a driver’s license. “We don’t really have a problem with this in my state,” he said in an interview. Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a Republican who oversees elections, said she supports the legislation in concept but provided a cautionary tale about how aggressively culling voter rolls can sometimes result in the removal of qualified voters. A few years ago, everyone in her household received mail ballots for a municipal election, except her. She had been removed from the rolls because she had been born in the Netherlands, where her father was stationed with the U.S. Air Force. “I was the lieutenant governor, I was overseeing elections, and I got taken off because I was born in the Netherlands,” she said, “So I think we definitely have those checks and balances in the state of Utah, maybe to an extreme.” The House vote comes days after the Republican National Committee released its party platform, which emphasizes border security issues and takes a stand against Democrats giving “voting rights” to migrants living in the country illegally. Republicans are expected to shine a light on their immigration and election integrity concerns at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee, where Trump is scheduled to accept his third straight nomination for president.

                    "text": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. House of Representatives on July 10 passed legislation that would require voters to provide proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections. The bill was approved in a mostly party-line vote of 221–198. Five Democrats—Reps. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), Donald Davis (D-N.C.), Jared Golden (D-Maine), Vincente Gonzalez (D-Texas), and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.)—joined all Republicans in voting for the legislation. Other Democrats opposed the bill, arguing that it’s redundant due to existing prohibitions on noncitizen voting. The measure is likely dead-on-arrival in the Democrat-controlled Senate. The White House has expressed opposition to the bill. Under the bill, acceptable forms of proof of citizenship include a passport, birth certificate, a government-issued photo ID showing the person was born in the United States, or a military ID showing the same. It would also require states to purge their voter rolls of any current noncitizens, in part by giving states no-cost access to databases run by the Department of Homeland Security and Social Security Administration. Democrats say that under the terms of the bill, it would become more difficult for natural-born and naturalized citizens to register as well. “It is already illegal under current law for noncitizens to register to vote or to vote in federal elections,” Ms. Clark’s office said. Republicans, agree that federal law technically prohibits voting by illegal immigrants, but say there are loopholes that make it possible for an illegal immigrant to vote. “It’s a part of the federal statutes,” Mr. Johnson said. “The problem is ... there’s no mechanism to ensure that only those registering or voting are actually citizens.” Republicans’ concerns are primarily related to the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), dubbed the Motor Voter law, which allows people to register to vote at the same time that they pick up a driver’s license from their state’s Department of Motor Vehicles or other state agencies. Foreigners living permanently in the United States are encouraged to get a U.S. drivers license; 19 states and the District of Columbia allow illegal immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses. The White House has pushed back against the bill, saying states already have safeguards to verify voter eligibility and maintain the accuracy of voter rolls. “This bill would do nothing to safeguard our elections, but it would make it much harder for all eligible Americans to register to vote and increase the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls,” it said in a July 8 statement of administration policy.",

According to NOTUS Reports' Oriana Gonzalez, former Trump lead health adviser Katy Talento at the conference touted a plan referenced in Project 2025 to use the Comstock Act of 1873 to ban the mailing of abortion-related medications in the United States. \"There is a law that says organizations are not allowed to ship abortion pills... other devices and equipment used for abortions,\" Talento said, in reference to the Comstock Act. “This is on the agenda for a pro-life administration.\" Plans to use the Comstock Act to effectively suppress the distribution of abortion medications were first reported by the New York Times this past February. The original act made it illegal to use the United States Postal Service to send materials deemed to be obscene or related to criminal activities. ALSO READ: Trump’s ‘secretary of retribution’ has a ‘target list’ of 350 people he wants arrested Although passed in the 19th Century, the act is still used to prosecute people who send child pornography and other illicit materials through the mail. After the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, however, some opponents of legalized abortion have argued that the law can be used to prosecute people who send drugs such as mifepristone. While Trump has denied any involvement in Project 2025, progressive journalist Judd Legum earlier this week documented how deeply many former Trump officials are involved with it, as two-thirds of the project's authors served inside his administration. In addition to all this, Legum showed that Trump has openly embraced many of the ideas in the past that were pushed by the Heritage Foundation, the right-wing think tank that is behind Project 2025.",

                    "text": "Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro trolled Democrats over their focus on the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 in an appearance before the House Judiciary Committee. While testifying in front of the House Judiciary Committee over the Global Alliance for Responsible Media’s alleged targeting of his company, the Daily Wire, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) redirected the conversation toward Project 2025. Pointing out renewed popular interest in it, the California Democrat asked Shapiro if he agreed with its suggestions. “Like President Trump, I haven’t looked all that deeply at Project 2025, but it seems that Democrats on this committee are sort of like Peter Pan and Tinker Bell,” Shapiro responded. “If they say Project 2025 enough, their presidential candidate becomes alive again.” The remarks drew laughter from the crowd and a brief smile from Swalwell. Swalwell then moved to ask about certain parts of Project 2025, adding that he agreed with wanting to cut bureaucracy and increase government efficiency. “Congrats on becoming a Republican,” Shapiro quipped. “My parents would be proud,” Swalwell responded, chuckling. Shapiro was testifying following a report from the committee showing that GARM had likely illegally colluded to silence conservative figures and outlets. Project 2025 has taken on an almost mythic position in the eyes of Democrats, with fears over its policy suggestions becoming a cornerstone of President Joe Biden’s 2024 campaign.

                    "text": "DALLAS (AP) — Investigators say a Southwest Airlines jet that experienced an unusual “Dutch roll” in flight had been parked outside during a strong storm and then underwent routine maintenance, after which pilots noticed odd movements of the rudder pedals. After the May 25 incident, Southwest mechanics found “substantial” damage in the aircraft's tail, where the rudder is located, but the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday that it hasn't determined when the damage occurred. The plane, a Boeing 737 Max, was grounded for more than a month but resumed flights last week, according to data from Flightradar24.com. Dutch roll is a swaying, rhythmic combination of yaw, or the tail sliding sideways, and the wingtips rocking up and down. The Southwest jet experienced the movement at 34,000 feet and again after descending to 32,000 feet while flying from Phoenix to Oakland, California. The condition can be dangerous, and modern planes have a “yaw damper” to stop the oscillations that characterize Dutch roll. After the plane landed, Southwest mechanics found fractures in the metal bracket and ribs that hold a backup power control unit to the rudder system. Investigators examined the damaged parts last week in Ogden, Utah. The NTSB said the plane was parked overnight at the New Orleans airport on May 16 during thunderstorms that packed gusting winds up to 84 mph, heavy rain and a tornado watch. On May 23, the plane underwent scheduled maintenance, and afterward pilots noticed the rudder pedals moving when the yaw damper was engaged. Pilots on the May 25 flight felt the pedals moving during the Dutch roll and even after landing, the NTSB said. John Cox, a former airline pilot and now a safety consultant, said the NTSB preliminary report indicates that the plane was most likely damaged during the storm. He said the near hurricane-force winds could have caused the rudder on the parked jet to slam back and forth. Cox said there was “absolutely no way in the world” the Dutch roll caused such severe damage, nor does he think it was related to the maintenance work. “I do not see this as a Max issue. I do not see this right now as a 737 issue,” he said. “I see this as a one-off.” Southwest inspected its 231 Max jets last month and found no other cases of damage around the rudder power units and no problems in new planes it has received since, according to the NTSB. Dallas-based Southwest declined to comment. It could be a year or longer before the NTSB determines a probable cause for the incident.",

                    "title": "Simone Biles and LeBron James are among athletes expected to bid 'adieu' to the Olympics in Paris",
                    "text": "Icons of their sports. Voices for equality and social justice. Elite performers. Simone Biles and LeBron James lead the list of athletes likely competing at their final Olympics. Add in that Andy Murray will be retiring after the Paris Games and that Rafael Nadal may bid goodbye to tennis, too, and the stage is set for some emotional, high-profile goodbyes. Here’s a look at some of the top competitors expected to say “adieu” to the Olympics — or their sport in general — in the French capital: Simone Biles At 27, Biles is the oldest American woman to make an Olympic gymnastics team since the 1950s. Having returned from a two-year break last summer, Biles can add to her career haul of seven Olympic medals — four of them gold — when she competes at the Bercy Arena. LeBron James At 39, James is about to become the first U.S. men’s basketball player to compete at the Olympics in three different decades. To get an idea of what stage he’s at in his career, consider this: When James and the U.S. team opened their Olympic training camp in Las Vegas, his son, Bronny, was making his pro debut for the Los Angeles Lakers in the California Classic summer league. Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal Murray’s goodbye to Wimbledon didn’t go the way he had hoped. The British player is hoping for a better result in the Olympic tennis competition on the red clay of Roland Garros, home of the French Open. Paris will mark Murray’s fifth Olympics, having won back-to-back singles golds in 2012 and 2016. While Murray has indicated that he plans to end his career after the Olympics, Nadal’s status is less clear. But playing the Olympics at the site where he won 14 French Opens — and where there’s a statue of him outside Court Philippe Chatrier — will be special no matter what Nadal does next. Nadal has won Olympic gold in both singles (in 2008) and doubles (in 2016) and will team up with Carlos Alcaraz for doubles in Paris. Shelly-Anne Fraser Pryce Jamaican sprinter Fraser-Pryce has announced that the Paris Games will be her fifth and final Olympics. The 37-year-old Fraser-Pryce, who has won eight Olympic medals, wants to spend more time with her husband and 6-year-old son, Zyon. Fraser-Pryce will run against Sha’Carri Richardson in the 100 meters. Gianmarco Tamberi One of the biggest showmen in track and field, the Italian high jumper Tamberi wants to go out on top by defending the gold medal that he shared with his good friend Mutaz Barshim in Tokyo. Both Tamberi and Barshim have indicated this will be their final Olympics. Sarah Sjöström At age 30, Swedish swimming standout Sjöström will be competing in her fifth Olympics. A winner of four medals at the Olympics, Sjöström is focusing on one individual event for Paris. She’ll race the 50-meter freestyle — an event she holds the world record in — plus three relays. Sjöström made her Olympic debut in Beijing in 2008 at the age of 14. Tom Daley Daley was Britain’s youngest athlete in 2008 at 14. Three years ago in Tokyo he won his first Olympic gold with partner Matty Lee in 10-meter synchronized and now he’s back for a fifth Olympics. Daley drew attention for knitting between dives in Tokyo as a way of relaxing. Mikkel Hansen With his shoulder-length hair and headband, the powerful left back Hansen is one of the most familiar faces in Danish sports. A three-time men’s world player of the year, a record he shares with longtime rival Nikola Karabatić, Hansen is considered one of the best handball players ever. He led Denmark to gold in Rio and then silver in Tokyo. Teddy Riner The French heavyweight judoka Riner is one of host France’s top medal hopes. He’s looking to add to his haul of five Olympic medals, including three gold. He’s also won a record 11 golds at worlds. ___ AP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games",

Having returned from a two-year break last summer, Biles can add to her career haul of seven Olympic medals — four of them gold — when she competes at the Bercy Arena.

Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal Murray’s goodbye to Wimbledon didn’t go the way he had hoped. The British player is hoping for a better result in the Olympic tennis competition on the red clay of Roland Garros, home of the French Open. Paris will mark Murray’s fifth Olympics, having won back-to-back singles golds in 2012 and 2016. While Murray has indicated that he plans to end his career after the Olympics, Nadal’s status is less clear. But playing the Olympics at the site where he won 14 French Opens — and where there’s a statue of him outside Court Philippe Chatrier — will be special no matter what Nadal does next.

                    "text": "The heat wave is continuing to make its way across the nation, which in the MLB betting world means it is juicy home run weather.Heat + humidity = carry, which means more home runs on average. So, with that thought in mind let's dive into our favorite MLB home run props of the day.Play 1: Corey Seager to Hit a Home Run (+255) FanDuelTexas Rangers vs. Los Angeles Angels, 9:38 p.m. ETSeager has been on somewhat of a tear recently, and he has a great opportunity to continue that tonight. While he isn't quite on the run he had at the end of May where he hit eight home runs in eight games, he is still on a roll. He did not hit one yesterday, but he did hit two in a row on Sunday and Monday, and after an incredibly slow start to the season he has given himself respectable numbers on the year.His ISO rate is .210, barrel rate is 16.2% and his hard hit rate is 49%. Of course, if you look at the past two months that ISO rate jumps up to .323, barrel rate is 21.7% and hard hit rate is 59.7%. That would be a 60 day stretch where he would have the second-best ISO rate in the MLB, the second-best barrel rate and the third-best hard hit rate. Seager also hits right-handed pitching better, and he is facing a righty tonight in Griffin Canning, a pitcher who also happens to struggle against left-handed hitting. Seager's ISO rate on the entire year against RHP is .245.The biggest reason his ISO rate and power numbers are so much better against RHP is his fly ball rate increases from 34.2% against lefties to 47% against righties. For context, that 47% fly-ball rate would be good for the 16th-best in MLB. Canning, meanwhile, has seen roughly the same amount of righty and lefty hitters and 10 of his 17 home runs have come against lefties. Canning is also just a below-average pitcher in general, allowing a barrel rate of 8.2% (28th-highest in MLB), hard hit rate of 42.1% (12th-highest) and an average exit velocity of 90.4MPH (10th-highest in MLB) all while having a top 35 launch angle as well.Play 2: Francisco Lindor to Hit a Home Run (+350) FanDuelWashington Nationals vs. New York Mets, 7:10 p.m. ETThis Mets game is absolutely incredible from a weather perspective, and despite the fact that Patrick Corbin, who is pitching for the Nats, does not generally give up a lot of home runs, we are going to have two Mets batters for today. Let's start with the weather, which is just bananas. For starters it is very hot and humid on the east coast, which always helps with carry, but in New York specifically there are 18 MPH winds blowing out of the stadium. Generally, the 15 MPH mark is when the wind starts to make a real impact, so the fact that we are getting 18 MPH on top of the humidity is great for our cause.Lindor, meanwhile, is having an great year overall with an ISO rate of .202 and a barrel rate of 13.7%, both of which are in the \"great\" category as defined by FanGraphs. Lindor is also significantly better against left-handed pitching. His ISO rate goes from .181 against RHP all the way up to .260 against LHP, with all his stats from average to wRC+ all significantly better against LHP. While Corbin is more of a ground ball, contact type of pitcher -- which is why he is not known as being one of the worst home run pitchers -- his numbers are worse across the board against right-handed hitting, and Lindor is a switch-hitter who will be batting righty against Corbin.Corbin's ground-ball rate drops 10 percentage points going from LHH to RHH, while his fly ball rate increases by 14 points. Lastly, Lindor has crushed Corbin over the last three years. In 30 at-bats he has ten total hits, three home runs and another two extra-base hits. These two just faced off in June and Lindor took him yard, so let's hope he can do so once again today.Play 3: Brandon Nimmo to Hit a Home Run (+575) CaesarsWashington Nationals vs. New York Mets, 7:10 p.m. ETNow for another player on the Mets, this time going with Brandon Nimmo. So, Nimmo is a lefty, and while we just mentioned how much worse Corbin is against righties as opposed to lefties, this is another situation where the batter has great results against the pitcher. Nimmo has 21 at-bats against Corbin in the last three years, and he is batting .333 in those at-bats with one home run. Not quite as good as Lindor's numbers, but still very good overall.Nimmo also gets the same benefits as the weather as Lindor does, so if he can get the ball slightly in the air with some power the wind and weather will do the rest. Nimmo is similar to Lindor in that he is having a decent year overall. He has an ISO rate of .208 and a barrel rate of 12.3%, both of which are once again in the \"great\" category defined by FanGraphs. From there he has a hard hit rate of 50.7% (16th-best in MLB) and an average exit velocity of 92.7MPH (tied for 13th-best in MLB).Since June 1, though, Nimmo has been great. In that stretch he has hit eight home runs with an ISO rate of .279. His barrel rate is 12.4%, hard hit rate is 53.9% and his average exit velocity is 93.3MPH. While Nimmo is a lefty going up against a lefty, his stats are pretty equal across the board whether he is going up against RHP or LHP.Newsweek may earn an affiliate commission if you sign up through the links in this article.

                    "text": "Had a nice little 2-1 day yesterday, and today I love the Mets, love the Astros and love a pair of pitchers in San Francisco.Play 1: New York Mets vs. Washington Nationals -- Mets over 5.5 runs (+110) DraftKingsThe matchup cannot get any better for the Mets at home tonight against lefty Patrick Corbin and the Nationals.Before we even dive into that matchup, the weather in New York on Wednesday night -- temps in the 80s, dewpoint in the 70s, and the wind blowing out to left at 20 MPH -- is a hitter's paradise. So things are already looking good.And then when we look at the matchup ... batten down the hatches.Corbin is not good, and has not been good for years. And against righties ... yeesh. He's striking out 14.5% of righties, walking 7%, giving up a .228 ISO and .382 wOBA, and is getting barrelled at a 10% rate.Meanwhile, the Mets destroy lefties. They're fourth in the majors in wOBA and ISO against lefties, and the righty brigade is led by J.D. Martinez (.287 ISO, .401 wOBA against lefties over the last two years), Pete Alonso (.298 ISO, .371 wOBA) and Francisco Lindor (.284 ISO, .396 wOBA). Oh, and let's not forget Mark Vientos (.219 ISO, .355 wOBA), Harrison Bader (.199 ISO, .335 wOBA) and Francisco Alvarez (.178 ISO, .294 wOBA).On top of all of that, Lindor and Alonso have rich histories against Corbin, with Alonso smacking five dingers in 46 plate appearances against him, and Lindor with three of his own in 41 turns at the plate.Baseball is baseball and anything can happen, but the Mets -- on paper -- are primed to rock Citi Field tonight.Play 2: Houston Astros vs. Miami Marlins -- Astros -1.5 runs (-114) FanDuelThe Astros offense has certainly run hot and cold this year, but tonight they basically get a bullpen game against the Marlins, and the Marlins bullpen is middling at best, with a 4.00 ERA and 1.30 WHIP.So the Astros should be able to plate a run here, a run there.But the real damage is set to be done on the hill, with lefty Framber Valdez -- and his sinker -- keeping Marlins batters off the basepaths.The only batter in the Marlins lineup who has had any success against the sinker over the last two years is Jake Burger. Heck, he's really the only Marlin to have any success against lefties, period, as he's the only one with an ISO over .200.And Valdez is no ordinary lefty. He gets ground balls at a 60%+ rate, strikes out 20% of batters, and gets barrelled virtually never at 4.8%.This one isn't that hard. The Astros should coast at home.Play 3: San Francisco Giants vs. Toronto Blue Jays -- Under 7 runs (-105) CaesarsRuns are hard to come by at Oracle Park to begin with, and it won't get any easier tonight, with Logan Webb on the hill for the Giants going up against Chris Bassitt for the Jays.For starters, they're both sinkerballers, so the ball won't be getting in the air too much. And in the case of Webb against the Jays bats, the ball won't be getting in the air at all.Three of their best hitters -- George Springer, Vlad Guerrero, and Bo Bichette -- have fly ball rates of 12%, 12%, and 5%, respectively, against sinkers over the last two years. These three are ground ball hitters to begin with, and pitchers like Webb are their kryptonite.Meanwhile, Webb is dominant, especially when pitching in San Francisco. He's got a 2.13 ERA at home and has given up a laughable two homers in 55 innings.Webb should cruise tonight.Meanwhile, Bassitt is no slouch, and has been dominant -- like, Cy Young-levels of dominant -- against right-handed batters this year. A .036 ISO and .280 wOBA along with a 2.8% barrel rate.Against lefties, he's a mere mortal: A .142 ISO, .345 wOBA and an 11.8% barrel rate.The Giants will probably send a quartet of lefties against Bassitt, but only one -- LaMonte Wade -- has had any real success against the sinker, which is Bassitt's dominant pitch.So yep: A couple of sinkerballers in San Francisco is a recipe for very few runs. I love the under.Newsweek may earn an affiliate commission if you sign up through the links in this article. See the sportsbook operator's terms and conditions for important details.

They are favored again on Wednesday, listed at -140 in the latest MLB odds. Philadelphia has been a mainstay in winning MLB parlays throughout the season, leading the league with a 59-32 record. Should you include the Phillies in your Wednesday MLB parlay picks? Wednesday's MLB schedule also features showdowns like the Diamondbacks vs. Braves, Rays vs. Yankees and Cardinals vs. Royals. Meanwhile, the Red Sox vs. Athletics is the only game on the MLB odds board with a double-digit run total (10). Before making any MLB picks or parlays, be sure to check out the MLB predictions and betting advice from SportsLine's proven simulation model. The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every MLB game 10,000 times. It entered Week 16 of the 2024 MLB season a profitable 49-37 on all-top rated MLB picks this season. Dating back to last season, it is on a 24-9 roll on top-rated run-line picks (+1077). Anybody following has seen strong returns. For Wednesday, the model has locked in three confident MLB best bets for games that begin at 6:40 p.m. ET or later. If you successfully parlay the picks, you'd be looking at a payout of almost 8-1. You can see the model's MLB picks only at SportsLine. Top MLB picks today After simulating every game on Wednesday 10,000 times, the model is picking the Padres (-139) to beat the Mariners. San Diego has been a streaky team of late, rattling off three-game, four-game and five-game winning streaks since the middle of June. The Padres are currently riding a three-game losing skid, so they will be motivated to get back on track on Wednesday night. Starting pitcher Michael King is 7-5 with a 3.51 ERA this season, allowing just one earned run in three of his last four starts. He is facing a Seattle lineup that ranks last in the majors in batting average and has the fourth-lowest run total. The Mariners also lead the MLB in strikeouts, so San Diego is positioned to have success on Wednesday. See the model's top MLB picks here.

The model is projecting 2.3 total bases for the young star. The 24-year-old righty is absolutely mashing this season. He has a .324 batting average with a .564 slugging percentage and an OPS of .936. His 25 doubles, nine triples and 15 home runs are all pacing to be career highs. Those are all notable marks in this situation since one extra-base hit would make this prop hit.

The model is projecting 1.3 total bases for Happ and rates this as a five-star pick, which is its maximum confidence rating. Happ is red-hot in July, batting .417 with an .875 slugging percentage and a whopping 1.375 OPS. He's recorded at least one hit in five of his last six games. Burnes presents a tough matchup, but Happ has seen him plenty of times dating back to when Burnes pitched for the Brewers in the NL Central. Happ has a career .292 average and an OPS of .935 against Burnes, so the model is confident that he'll be able to record at least a base hit in this one, making it one of the top Cubs vs. Orioles prop picks.

                    "text": "Two decades after Bill Stampfl went missing during an avalanche while climbing Peru’s highest mountain, his daughter, Jennifer Stampfl, had more or less accepted that he was gone forever. Sometimes she still had dreams of him, alive in Peru, amnesiac and unaware that he had family in the United States. She knew he had hated the cold, so the idea of his being trapped in ice was unsettling. But she thought she had made her peace with the mountain keeping her father. Then, one Saturday last month, she got a call from her brother, Joseph Stampfl. He began: Are you sitting down? “He told me that they found Dad,” she said. “And I said, ‘What?’” A fellow American, Ryan Cooper, had tracked down Joseph Stampfl to tell him that he and a group of climbers had stumbled upon his father’s body on Mount Huascarán, a 22,205-foot peak in the Andes range. As climate change helped melt the mountain’s glaciers, Bill Stampfl’s body emerged from the ice that had preserved it since he went missing during an expedition with two friends in 2002, the Peruvian police said on Tuesday.",

                    "title": "Details emerge after body of American climber buried by avalanche 22 years ago is found in Peru ice: \"A shock\"",
                    "text": "An avalanche buried American climber Bill Stampfl 22 years ago as he made his way up one of the highest peaks in the Andes mountains. His family knew there was little hope of finding him alive, or even of retrieving his corpse from the thick fields of snow and the freezing ice sheets that cover the 22,000-foot tall Huascaran peak.But in June, Stampfl's son got a call from a stranger, who said he had come across the climber's frozen — and mostly intact — body, as he made his own ascent up Huascaran.\"It was so out of left field. We talk about my dad, we think about him all the time,\" Joseph Stampfl said. \"You just never think you are going to get that call.\"He then shared the news with his family.\"It's been a shock,\" said Jennifer Stampfl, the climber's daughter. \"When you get that phone call that he's been found your heart just sinks. You don't know how exactly to feel at first.\"Police in Peru said Tuesday they had recovered Stampfl's body from the mountain where he was buried by the avalanche in 2002, when the 58-year-old was climbing with two friends who were also killed.A group of policemen and mountain guides put Stampfl's body on a stretcher, covered it in an orange tarp and slowly took it down the icy mountain. The body was found at an altitude of 17,060 feet, about a nine-hour hike from one of the camps where climbers stop when they tackle Huascaran's steep summit.Jennifer Stampfl said the family plans to move the body to a funeral home in Peru's capital, Lima, where it can be cremated and his ashes repatriated.\"For 22 years, we just kind of put in our mind: 'This is the way it is. Dad's part of the mountain, and he's never coming home,'\" she said.Stampfl's body and clothing were preserved by the ice and freezing temperatures, police said. His driver's license was found inside a hip pouch. It says he was a resident of Chino in California's San Bernardino County.\"I've never seen anything like that\"The effort to retrieve Stampfl's remains began last week, after an American climber came upon the frozen body while making his way to the Huascaran summit. The climber opened the pouch and read the name on the driver's license. He called Stampfl's relatives, who then got in touch with local mountain guides.Joseph Stampfl said they worked with a Peruvian mountain rescue association to retrieve his father's body, which was about 3,000 to 4,000 feet below where he and his two friends were believed to have been killed.\"He was no longer encased in ice,\" the son said. \"He still has got his boots on.\"A team of 13 mountaineers participated in the recovery operation — five officers from an elite police unit and eight mountain guides who work for Grupo Alpamayo, a local tour operator that takes climbers to Huascaran and other peaks in the Andes.Eric Raul Albino, director of Grupo Alpamayo, said he was hired by Stampfl's family to retrieve the body.Lenin Alvardo, one of the police officers who participated in the recovery operation, said Stampfl's clothes were still mostly intact. The hip pouch with his driving license also contained a pair of sunglasses, a camera, a voice recorder and two decomposing $20 bills. A gold wedding ring was still on the left hand.\"I've never seen anything like that,\" Alvarado said.Huascaran is Peru's highest peak. Hundreds of climbers visit the mountain each year with local guides, and it typically takes them about a week to reach the summit.However, climate change has affected Huascaran and the surrounding peaks higher than 5,000 meters, known as the Cordillera Blanca. According to official figures, the Cordillera Blanca has lost 27% of its ice sheet over the past five decades.Stampfl was with friends Matthew Richardson and Steve Erskine in trying to climb Huascaran in 2002. They had travelled the world to climb challenging mountains and had reached the peaks of Kilimanjaro, Rainier, Shasta and Denali, according to a Los Angeles Times report at the time.Erskine's body was found shortly after the avalanche, but Richardson's corpse is still missing.Jennifer Stampfl said a plaque in memory of the three friends was placed at the summit of Mount Baldy in Southern California, where the trio trained for their expeditions. She said they may return to the site with her father's remains.Janet Stampfl-Raymer, who was Stampfl's wife, said that when her husband wasn't working as a civil engineer, he loved to be a mountaineer.\"He was a kind man. He was humble. He loved God, and he loved the mountains,\" she said.\"We all just dearly loved my husband. He was one of a kind,\" she said. \"We're very grateful we can bring his body home to rest.\"Stampfl carefully planned his mountaineering expeditions, his daughter said. She also said he was very humble and did not like to draw attention to himself.\"The fact that he is in the news, it is so not my dad,\" she said.Melting ice reveals bodies of long-missing climbersAs glaciers increasingly melt and recede around the world, which many scientists blame on global warming, there has been an increase in discoveries of the remains of hikers, skiers and other climbers who went missing decades ago.In June, five frozen bodies were retrieved from Mount Everest — including one that was just skeletal remains — as part of Nepal's mountain clean-up campaign on Everest and adjoining peaks Lhotse and Nuptse.Last year, the remains of a German climber who went missing in 1986 were recovered on a glacier in the Swiss Alps.In 2017, Italian mountain rescue crews recovered the remains of hikers on a glacier on Mont Blanc's southern face likely dating from the 1980s or 1990s. Just a few weeks later, the remains of a climber discovered in the Swiss Alps were identified as a British mountaineer who went missing in 1971, local police said Thursday.That same year, a shrinking glacier in Switzerland revealed the bodies of a frozen couple who went missing 75 years ago. Marcelin Dumoulin and his wife, Francine, were 40 and 37 years old when they disappeared on Aug. 15, 1942. Regional police told local media that their bodies were discovered near a ski lift on the glacier by a worker for an adventure resort company.In 2016, the bodies of a renowned mountain climber and expedition cameraman who were buried in a Himalayan avalanche in 1999 were found partially melting out of a glacier.",

                    "text": "Another Simpsons joke is coming true — this time involving hip-hop group Cypress Hill. On Wednesday, July 10, the band is set to take the stage with the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) at the Royal Albert Hall. The performance comes 28 years after The Simpsons joked about Cypress Hill accidentally ordering the LSO \"possibly while high\" during the 1996 \"Homerpalooza\" episode. They ended up joining forces to perform the band's 1993 hit, \"Insane in the Brain.\" Per the Royal Albert Hall's website, the group — who have sold over 20 million albums worldwide — is set to perform \"a special rendition\" of their 1993 album, Black Sunday, \"as well as other hits from their extensive back-catalog\" with the orchestra. In addition to \"Insane in the Brain,\" the setlist will also include songs like 1993's \"I Wanna Get High.\" While speaking to the BBC during rehearsals for the one-night-only performance, B-Real (né Louis Mario Freese), said, \"It's been something that we've talked about for many years since The Simpsons episode first aired.\" \"So it's very special for us. And it's coming off the heels of our 30th anniversary for our Black Sunday album,\" he added. The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now! The group admitted this was \"one of those checklist moments\" in their decades-long career. In The Simpsons episode, English-American guitarist, singer and songwriter Peter Frampton was the one attempting to book the orchestra. And in real life, Cypress Hill band has been trying to get him to attend the highly anticipated show. \"Yes, actually, we've been trying to invite him,\" B-Real, 54, told the BBC. \"We've never met him before, but we thought it would be a kick to invite the legendary Peter Frampton,\" he said, with the group adding that they \"salute The Simpsons because if they had not written that episode, we probably wouldn't be doing this.\" B-Real, along with his fellow Cypress Hill members Sen Dog and DJ Lord, also told Sky News this would be a historic and \"probably one of the biggest moments\" ever for the group.

Cypress Hill in Season 7’s “Homerplooza” episode California hip-hop legends Cypress Hill appeared, along with several other music artists, in The Simpsons season 7 almost-finale, “Homerpalooza.” The episode centers around Homer getting a job as a stunt freak on a music festival tour and features guest voices including Sonic Youth, Smashing Pumpkins, Peter Frampton, and of course, Cypress Hill. Given the glut of guest stars to fit into that 22 minutes, each act basically got a single gag dedicated to themselves. For Cypress Hill, the bit involved the group ordering the London Symphony Orchestra for their concert performance “possibly while high.” After Sen Dog, B-Real and DJ Muggs huddle up, the group sheepishly decides that yes, they likey did indeed order them. The two entities join forces to perform the most ornate version of “Insane in the Brain” that’s ever been done. Good times, good bit, Homer learns a lesson, cue Gracie Films logo. Cypress Hill to actually perform with a symphony Well, here we are, 28 years later and that bit has become a reality, as on July 10th, Cypress Hill will be performing with the LSO at London’s Royal Albert Hall. The legendary venue’s official website even describes the event by referencing the joke! They all know what they’re doing. Regardless, Cypress Hill’s performance is described as being “a special rendition” of their 1993 album, Black Sunday, “as well as other hits from their extensive back-catalog” complete orchestral accompaniment. Sounds like a good time, if I’m being honest here. During rehearsals, B-Real (Louis Mario Freese) told the BBC that “It’s been something that we’ve talked about for many years since The Simpsons episode first aired.” They even attempted to invite Peter Frampton, who in the context of the original episode had actually ordered the LSO. With real life reflecting art, it’s just a matter of time now before Sonic Youth raids Peter Frampton’s cooler. After all, he’s not gonna eat all that watermelon.

The orchestra, conducted by Troy Miller, will provide “unique orchestral arrangements of the band’s most iconic songs including 'Insane in the Brain' and 'I Wanna Get High'\" as part of the long-awaited collaboration.

Later in the episode, it is eventually revealed that it was actually Peter Frampton — not Cypress Hill — who had originally attempted to book the orchestra for his set. So, naturally, the group told the BBC they attempted to invite him to the gig, but hadn’t heard back. B-Real noted, “We've never met him before, but we thought it would be a kick to invite the legendary Peter Frampton.\"",

Officials said they are assessing the damage to the Houston Texans' home facility and others structures on the NRG Park campus. Local news outlets posted video footage and photos of the damage on Tuesday, showing several openings in the retractable fabric NRG Stadium roof. \"Like many of our neighbors in the Gulf Coast region, NRG Park sustained damage from Hurricane Beryl, including to the roof of NRG Stadium,\" NRG Park CEO Ryan Walsh said in a statement. \"Harris County Sports & Convention Corporation officials are collaborating with state, county and city officials to assist with recovery efforts throughout the region. This collective undertaking requires all of us to work together with a strong commitment to our community. \"While we assist with these efforts, we are also assessing the extent of damages to NRG Park facilities. We look forward to seeing our neighbors at NRG Park soon as we return to normal operations.\" The Category 1 hurricane arrived Monday in Texas and has since weakened to a tropical storm. The storm went left millions without power with its heavy wind and rain and has been linked to at least eight deaths within Texas and Louisiana. NRG Park also includes NRG Center, NRG Arena and NRG Astrodome, the former home of the Houston Astros and Houston Oilers. NRG Stadium is scheduled to host the Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey Circus on July 19. The Texans are to host the New York Giants in a preseason game Aug. 17 there. The Texans are scheduled to report to training camp July 17 at Houston Methodist Training Center, which is across the street from NRG Stadium.",

                    "title": "Trump’s ‘secretary of retribution’ has a ‘target list’ of 350 people he wants arrested",
                    "text": "Retribution is at the center of Donald Trump’s third presidential election campaign. “I am your warrior,” Trump proclaimed earlier this year. “I am your justice, and for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.” Trump’s loyal surrogates have duly embraced the project — perhaps no one more zealously than Ivan Raiklin, a retired Army Reserve lieutenant colonel and former U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency employee, who bills himself as the former and would-be president’s “future secretary of retribution.” Raiklin is seeking to enlist so-called “constitutional” sheriffs in rural, conservative counties across the country to detain Trump’s political enemies. Or, as he says, carry out “live-streamed swatting raids” against individuals on his “Deep State target list.” “This is a deadly serious report,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) told Raw Story. “A retired U.S. military officer has drawn up a ‘Deep State target list’ of public officials he considers traitors, along with our family members and staff. His hit list is a vigilante death warrant for hundreds of Americans and a clear and present danger to the survival of American democracy and freedom. READ: Trump's far-right army is threatening bloodshed — believe them Raskin called on House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to “denounce this dangerous plot and to repudiate threats of, and planning for, political violence from any quarter. Bipartisan opposition to vigilante violence and assassination plots is essential for American government to continue.” The list Raiklin has been circulating since January is extensive. It includes numerous Democratic and Republican elected officials; FBI and intelligence officials; members of the House Select January 6 Committee; U.S. Capitol Police officers and civilian employees; witnesses in Trump’s two impeachment trials and the Jan. 6 committee hearings; and journalists from publications ranging from CNN and the Washington Post to Reuters and Raw Story — all considered political enemies of Trump. Julie Farnam, a former U.S. Capitol Police employee named on the list who as assistant director of intelligence and interagency coordination warned about the potential for violence in advance of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack, said she would not be intimidated by the list. “Any hit list is designed to impart the silence and fear of those named on it,” Farnam told Raw Story. “But silence is victory for those who write such lists. Conversely, speaking the truth without fear will always be the undoing of those who seek to intimidate and spread hate in our world. I can never be silenced.” In addition to Farnam, the list includes nine current or former U.S. Capitol Police employees. The agency declined to comment for this story. Raw Story is not publishing the full list given the potential risk posed to people unaware that they’re on it. One individual named on the list who spoke on condition of anonymity noted that Raiklin is associated with retired Lt. General Michael Flynn. “And Trump himself has repeated on dozens of occasions calls for revenge, retribution and retaliation,” the person told Raw Story. “This is another example of that broader phenomenon of revenge against political enemies that animates the former president and his entire movement, and for that reason should concern us all.” The Trump campaign did not respond to emails requesting comment for this story. ‘Attack on our democracy’ The accusations of “treason” and other imagined offenses leveled by Raiklin against these individuals are typically based on fanciful legal theories and outlandish factual claims, if anything at all. For example: Raiklin, in a podcast, suggested without evidence that the unidentified person responsible for setting pipe bombs outside the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee on Jan. 6, 2021, was “a subordinate-surrogate of the Capitol Police Board,” which oversees the Capitol Police. But Raiklin is nothing if not self-assured that the “evidence” he’s gathering on anti-Trump “deep state” plotters is real. So real, it seems, that Raiklin claims the material — fully revealed — would establish probable cause for county sheriffs across the nation to issue arrest warrants for various high-ranking officials who have, in one way or another, run afoul of Trump. Under Raiklin’s objectively bizarre plan, the sympathetic sheriffs would deputize some 75,000 military veterans — veterans he claims have been pushed out of service because they refused to comply with COVID-19 vaccine mandates — to carry out the arrests. Raiklin has gone so far as to pitch his plan to a group of far-right sheriffs who met in Las Vegas in April. Public records requests filed by Raw Story with dozens of county sheriff offices reveal that word of Raiklin’s efforts has reached the email inboxes of sheriffs from Wisconsin to Oklahoma. But Raiklin’s effort to enlist these sheriffs appears to be foundering: Not one has openly signed on, and even some who are sympathetic to his cause publicly warn that his plan violates due process. Undaunted, Raiklin has attempted to build relationships with conservative members of Congress, and aides to two Republican lawmakers who chair influential House committees confirmed to Raw Story that they are familiar with him. An overriding reason for why Raiklin hasn’t been entirely marginalized or relegated by fellow conservatives to the realm of kooks and gadflies? Raiklin uses the kind of hyperbolic language that Trump himself uses — and that Trump’s base eats up. He gives federal agencies and media outlets Trump-like nicknames such as “FB-Lie,” “Faux-litico” and “National Poison Radio.” “My nickname is the Deep State marauder, aka the mauler,” Raiklin told a group of election deniers in New Jersey earlier this year. “And I like using ice picks instead of poking the bear.” In a video posted in May to X, which now accrued more than 10 million views, Raiklin said, “Expect to see live-streamed swatting raids of every single individual on that Deep State target list, because the precedence has already been set.” Notwithstanding Raiklin’s claim that his plan would be “legal, moral and ethical,” swatting — the false reporting of an emergency to garner a response from law enforcement for the purpose of harassing a target — is illegal. Raiklin has nevertheless promoted the idea in podcast interviews, multiple posts on X, a press conference and conversations with prominent far-right extremists. In recent days, Raiklin’s rhetoric has escalated beyond setting out future hypothetical scenarios for retribution. He mocked one former federal employee blocking him on X while suggesting that the targeted individual “wants me to speak to him in person” and asking him for his “preferred punishment for committing treason.” And during a podcast, he claimed to be surveilling a U.S. Capitol Police employee, whom he mentioned by name, “both physically and digitally.” Experts worry that provocative rhetoric from figures such as Raiklin could impose a climate of fear on civil servants simply trying to do their jobs. Even worse, Raiklin’s rhetoric could inspire violence against them. “The idea that you would target anyone that was there on the basis of allegiance to the rule of law and the Constitution is really scary,” Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, told Raw Story. Stier’s organization promotes professional, merit-based civil service as a pillar of good governance — a notion that he said is being increasingly challenged. “This represents, in my view, an attack on our democracy,” Stier said. “We have a rule of law. If any civil servants are violating the law, there are mechanisms in place to hold them accountable. Vigilantism is not the way to have a society function.” Raiklin responded to a phone call requesting comment by posting a recording of the voicemail on his X account on Tuesday, while commenting: “Looks like Elements of the Deep State Target List have asked @jordangreennc of Raw Sewage to try to find out more about my list….” Later, he acknowledged a set of written questions submitted by Raw Story but didn't answer them, while accusing Raw Story and \"domestic terrorist leftists\" of hounding him. \"Look at my entire Deep State target list,\" Raiklin said. \"That is the beginning. This is the scratching of the surface of who is going to be criminalized for their treason, okay?\" One prominent media organization named on Raiklin’s “target” list expressed concern for its journalists, five of whom also appear on the list by name. “The conspiracy theories underpinning this list are baseless, and the calls for targeted harassment are dangerous,” Charlie Stadtlander, a spokesperson for the New York Times, told Raw Story. “The Times reporters on the list are simply professional journalists doing their jobs. Swatting is a criminal offense, and in the event of any instances directed at our employees, the Times will work with law enforcement to prosecute those responsible.” Said Raw Story Publisher Roxanne Cooper: “Purposefully threatening and endangering the safety of working journalists is both reprehensible and illegal, and the American public should reject and denounce anyone who engages in such behavior.” CNN, Reuters, the Atlantic and American Oversight declined to comment on Raiklin. Emails to the Washington Post, Politico, ABC News, NBC News and MSNBC, whose journalists are also named on the list, went unreturned. Who is Ivan Raiklin? As the 2020 election approached, conspiracy minded Trump supporters with active Twitter accounts were in abundance. Most never broke through the incessant MAGA noise, or merely added another note to its election denialism dissonance. Raiklin was different. He was a seasoned veteran with a background in military intelligence who wound up playing a small but significant role in the effort to overturn the 2020 election in Trump’s name. Following a distinguished career in the U.S. Armed Forces in which he served as a military attaché to the former Soviet Republic of Georgia and foreign affairs specialist assigned to the Ukraine Crisis Team, Raiklin left the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2017 to run for U.S. Senate in Virginia, according to the Washington Post. At the time, Raiklin’s candidacy in 2018 provided little indication of the MAGA loyalist relishing the destruction of Trump’s enemies that he would become. If anything, Raiklin fashioned himself as a force of apolitical positivity. “The reason I’m running is that we’ve had such a negative political atmosphere the past couple years,” Raiklin told the Courier in Iowa. “I want to inject a ‘positive disruption’ in the political conversation. Being a veteran of 20 years, I’m pretty much a political agnostic.” But Raiklin didn’t get far: He failed to garner a sufficient number of signatures to make it onto the Republican primary ballot. And when he sued the Virginia GOP and the state Department of Elections, claiming that he was unfairly excluded, a federal judge tossed out the suit. Following his disappointing foray into electoral politics, Raiklin began his turn toward Trump’s MAGA movement. In 2019, he appeared at a QAnon-themed fundraiser for retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, whom Raiklin met in 2010. (Flynn and Raiklin have become close in recent years, with Raiklin urging Trump to select Flynn as his vice presidential running mate and Flynn featuring Raiklin in his current speaking tour.) Roughly a week after the 2020 election, when major media outlets had called the election for Democratic candidate Joe Biden, Raiklin went on Alex Jones’ conspiracy theory show InfoWars and confidently predicted that Trump would ultimately obtain the necessary number of electoral votes to secure reelection. “I absolutely guarantee it,” he said. “One hundred percent. Unequivocally. Full stop. There is no possibility that he does not reach 270.” It's a classic example of how Trump’s followers often act on Trump’s wishes or anticipate his desires without receiving specific directives. For months, Trump had been saying that the only way he’d lose the election is if Democrats stole it through fraud. Now, Trump had lost, and Raiklin was arguing that Trump was winning, against all evidence. Raiklin, in essence, operates as an agent of Trumpism independent of Trump. And as the 2024 election nears, the same dynamic is apparent: Trump articulates the broad themes, and his supporters scramble to put them into practice. “Stand back and stand by” set the stage for the Jan. 6 insurrection in 2021, and now, “I am your retribution” serves as a solicitation to supporters such as Raiklin to put together specific plans for retribution against Trump’s political enemies. ‘Operation Pence Card’ Raiklin’s primary contribution to the effort to overturn the 2020 election is a memo he drafted for the benefit of Trump’s presidential campaign. Entitled “Operation Pence Card,” it proffered a novel legal argument that Vice President Mike Pence held the authority to set aside electoral votes from states narrowly carried by Biden. The plan is widely associated with attorney John Eastman, who now faces charges of racketeering and conspiracy in Georgia, and with conspiracy, fraud and forgery in Arizona. But Raiklin actually tweeted out his plan one day before Eastman drafted his now-infamous stop-the-steal memo. And Raiklin wielded enough influence that Trump himself, on Dec. 23, 2020, retweeted Raiklin’s “Operation Pence Card” tweet to his tens of millions of followers. Around the same time, Raiklin dined with then-Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who attended a meeting at the White House along with other House Republicans to discuss plans to object on Jan. 6 to the congressional certification of the presidential election — the final, generally ceremonial step before a presidential inauguration. On Jan. 4, 2021, Raiklin had told Jerome Corsi, a longtime conspiracy theorist, that with regard to Trump supporters descending on Washington, D.C. en masse: “I am not calling for any violence, but at the same time, I can’t stop people from committing it.” Raiklin was present at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 when a pro-Trump mob breached Congress’ defenses and temporarily stopped lawmakers’ electoral vote certification. Raiklin has not been charged with any crime related to the attack. Following the Jan. 6 attack, the Army Reserve opened an investigation into whether Raiklin violated its rules against partisan political activity, but by early 2022, the service had cleared him of wrongdoing. Raiklin has said the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Department of Homeland Security have also investigated him, but those investigations likewise concluded without formal accusations of wrongdoing against Raiklin. “So what does that trigger me to do?” Raiklin said during a presentation to a group of election deniers in New Jersey in February. “It weaponizes me against them. And so, since they haven’t found anything, and you’re investigating me, sir, I have the capability and capacity to start digging into you, your family, your friends, your associates — every single thing that you do in your life.” Whitewashing the crimes of violent J6 rioters While avoiding prosecution himself, Raiklin has eagerly taken up the cause of defendants who claim they were wrongfully prosecuted for their role in the Jan. 6 attack. Ivan Raiklin and convicted Jan. 6 offender Brandon Fellows sit behind former Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci during a House subcommittee hearing in June. Courtesy C-SPAN In June, Raiklin held a press conference in Detroit to promote his “live-streamed swatting raids” scheme. He did so alongside Treniss Jewell Evans III, who served a 20-day prison sentence for illegally entering the Capitol. Also speaking at the press conference: Sarah McAbee, the wife of a former sheriff’s deputy who is currently serving a 70-month sentence for assaulting a Washington, D.C., metropolitan police officer. Ronald Colton McAbee, Sarah McAbee’s husband, wore patches with the word “SHERIFF” and the emblem of the anti-government Three Percenter movement on his clothing while taking part in an hours-long battle at the mouth of the Lower West Terrace Tunnel on Jan. 6. A GiveSendGo campaign to support his wife applauds McAbee for answering “the call to stand up for our nation,” but following his conviction the Department of Justice described him as witnessing rioters knock an officer defending the U.S. Capitol to the ground. McAbee’s response was the opposite of rendering aid, according to the government. After the officer was kicked and stripped of his baton by rioters, the government contends that “McAbee stepped into the archway, grabbed the officer’s leg, and pulled him further toward the crowd. When a second MPD officer stepped off the police line to assist the downed officer, McAbee stood up, yelled at the officer who had stepped out to assist, and then swung his arms and hands towards the officer’s head and torso. McAbee made contact with the officer and was wearing the reinforced gloves at the time of the assault.” In the run-up to Jan. 6, Raiklin had baselessly ascribed the legitimate election of Joe Biden to “domestic fraud” committed by people “potentially under foreign actors’ payroll.” Now, at the press conference in Detroit in June 2024, Raiklin was inverting the violent crimes committed by Trump supporters to portray them, not the officers defending the Capitol, as the victims. “You need to know who is coming after us,” Raiklin said, naming two people who are part of the U.S. Capitol security apparatus. Without presenting any evidence, Raiklin accused one of the men of “weaponizing and working with the DOJ… to criminalize against Sarah’s husband.” Cultivating relationships with House Republicans All the while, Raiklin is forging ties with Republican lawmakers who are sympathetic to the Jan. 6 rioters. While leveling outlandish charges of criminal misconduct at federal civil servants, Raiklin has become a familiar presence at congressional committee hearings controlled by Republican lawmakers eager to downplay the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, or, alternately, shift blame to Democrats for the violence. Raiklin has sat in the gallery behind the witnesses in at least five House committee hearings over the past year. Among them: the House Administration Oversight Subcommittee chaired by Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-GA), the House Oversight and Accountability Committee chaired by Rep. James Comer (R-KY) and the House Judiciary Committee chaired by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH). “I don’t just sit back behind the witnesses when I’m in the House,” Raiklin said on a podcast in May. “For 15 months, I’ve been grinding day in and day out talking to dozens of members of Congress giving ideas on what needs to be done.” On another podcast, Raiklin said: “The only person that understands this is a guy by the name of Barry Loudermilk…. Why? Well, because he’s doing the right thing. And I get an opportunity to explain this to him and his staff regularly.” Nick Petromelis, an aide to Loudermilk, told Raw Story he, Petromelis, is “familiar” with Raiklin. Loudermilk ignored a request from the now-defunct House Select January 6 Committee to explain a tour he gave to constituents on the eve of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. His committee deposed Farnam, the former U.S. Capitol Police intelligence leader who is on Raiklin’s target list, last month. Austin Hacker, an aide to Comer, likewise said he, Hacker, was aware that Raiklin had attended House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearings. Despite promising in late May that he would find out whether Comer had personally spoken to Raiklin, Hacker stopped responding to follow-up messages from Raw Story. Raiklin said on a podcast in May that he has sent his “Deep State target list” to Comer, Jordan and the Administration Oversight Subcommittee chaired by Loudermilk. Hacker told Raw Story that Comer, his boss, does not have the “target list” document. Aides to Jordan and the House Administration Oversight Committee did not respond to emails from Raw Story seeking confirmation that they received copies of the list. None of the three House members responded to requests for comment about whether they support Raiklin’s antics. Ivan Raiklin (center, in white T-shirt) attends a congressional hearing on the Jan. 6 pipe bombs investigation held earlier this year by the House Administration Oversight Subcommittee chaired by Rep. Barry Loudermilk. Courtesy C-SPAN Raiklin has singled out other members of Congress for praise. Of Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), who filed legislation to hold U.S. Attorney Merrick Garland in “inherent contempt,” Raiklin said she “has exhibited the maximum courage that her position allows.” Luna’s legislation would hold the attorney general in “inherent contempt” for refusing demands to turn over audio of Special Counsel Robert Hur’s interview with Biden, related to Biden’s retention of classified documents in the garage of his Delaware home. “Inherent contempt” is a tool that would allow the House sergeant-at-arms to take Garland into custody and compel him to sit for a congressional proceeding. Raiklin told one podcaster that he “saw” Luna at a congressional hearing in May. Luna’s office did not respond to repeated requests for comment. ‘Go to the maximum level’ While cultivating ties with members of Congress, Raiklin has been lobbying sheriffs — with mixed results — to join his effort. To reach potentially sympathetic sheriffs, Raiklin has focused on an organization called the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association. Under the leadership of Richard Mack, a former sheriff from Arizona, the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association has promoted the controversial view that county sheriffs are the highest law in the land and are within their rights to ignore any federal and state laws that they deem to be unconstitutional. But Mack told Raw Story he has severed ties with Raiklin since talking with him in early June, and that he disapproves of Raiklin’s rhetoric. During the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association’s annual convention during April in Las Vegas, Raiklin asked a panel of sheriffs if they would “be willing to go to the maximum level to create consequences for these federal actors” whom he claimed had committed “seditious conspiracy.” The response was less than promising. Still, the potential for violence should not be discounted, according to Devin Burghart, executive director of the Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights and someone who has been monitoring the far right for more than three decades. “It is certainly not out of the realm of possibility to see them using the office of the sheriff and posses they wish to create to start rounding up political opponents,” Burgart told Raw Story. “Right now, in the far right, the promotion of post-election violence and bloody political retribution has become disturbingly commonplace. In that context, the results of the election are almost an afterthought — only important in determining whether their murderous rage will have state sanction.” While the far-right’s willingness to escalate may increase as the election approaches, at the time of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association convention in April, the two elected sheriffs on the panel were taking a cautious approach. Sheriff Bob Songer from Klickitat County in Washington state told Raiklin that much as he might want to help, he doubted many prosecutors would be willing to press charges. Sheriff Dar Leaf from Barry County in Michigan, put it more forcefully. “We’re not going to be able to just go out and arrest,” he said. “We’ve got to do a grand jury indictment, just like the Constitution says.” Leaf’s far-right credentials would seem to make him a prime candidate for Raiklin’s project. He gained national notoriety in 2020 when he suggested that members of an anti-government militia accused of attempting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer might have been trying to carry out a citizen’s arrest. Leaf has falsely claimed that there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election, and a lawyer representing Leaf reportedly sought evidence from an ad hoc group organized by lawyer Sidney Powell and Michael Flynn in December 2020 that could be used to justify “issuing probable cause warrants to sequester Dominion voting machines.” But if Raiklin and his allies were discouraged by Leaf’s response at the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association convention, they haven’t given any indication of it. During a podcast appearance with Mark Finchem, a former Arizona state representative who took part in the effort to overturn the 2020 election, Raiklin said he was certain that the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association could help “identify which county sheriffs would be clamoring, clamoring to prosecute these scum.” “I know one,” Finchem replied. “Dar Leaf in Barry County, Michigan.” Reached by Raw Story earlier this month, Leaf said that despite fielding a question from him at the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association convention, he doesn’t know who Raiklin is. Leaf reiterated his rejection of Raiklin’s plan by expressing an aversion to politically motivated prosecutions. Furthermore, Leaf warned that if indictments were obtained through grand juries “stacked” with Trump supporters, any criminal activity uncovered through depositions would be thrown out “because we started out breaking the law.” Among dozens of other sheriff’s offices across the country contacted for this story, two in Wisconsin — Burnett County and Polk County — confirmed receiving an email with the subject heading: “Ivan Raiklin Requests Deputization of 80K Veterans” that linked to Raiklin’s video and encouraged them to get in contact. “Please Watch this viral video that has garnered 9.8M views in 5 days,” it reads. “Important you understand. Remember your Oath.” Raiklin’s name landed in one other sheriff’s inbox through a subscription to the “General Flynn Newsletter,” which is promoting the documentary about the former national security adviser. The email, received by Tulsa County Sheriff Vic Regalado in Oklahoma, describes Raiklin as a member of a team “hand-selected” by Flynn to provide event attendees “with an informative and unforgettable experience.” The email describes the “General Flynn was Framed Evidence Wall,” a visual prop that Raiklin uses prior to each film screening that presents “an exhaustive timeline and link analysis of all the major political and government officials at the most senior levels that weaponized against General Flynn to prevent him from exposing their corruption.” During his months-long campaign, Raiklin has continuously referenced Mack and the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association in an effort to build credibility for his plan. During his press conference with Treniss Evans in Detroit, Raiklin mentioned that the previous evening he’d “had a very long conversation with a guy by the name of Sheriff Mack” on the topic of “vetting and communicating with sheriffs.” On a livestream of the press conference, Raiklin displayed a photo of the two men huddling over a laptop, suggesting a collaborative effort. In a recent interview, Mack told Raw Story at the time that he had been “getting all sorts of calls” about Raiklin. But since that meeting, Mack said he has soured on Raiklin’s plan. “I’m afraid I don’t approve of some of his language, the hyperbole, the rhetoric,” Mack said. For the same reason, Mack said, he resigned from the Oath Keepers. Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the far-right group that recruited from the ranks of retired law enforcement and military veterans, is currently serving an 18-year prison sentence for seditious conspiracy at a federal prison in Cumberland, Md. “It’s not where CSPOA can go,” Mack said, adding that he and Raiklin “are not working together at all.” Since early June, Mack said that the two men have not spoken or exchanged any emails. “Quite frankly, he talks about that list of 350 people — I’m sure they can afford lawyers,” Mack said. “It reeks of lawsuits, and it doesn’t follow due process.” During his press conference with Evans, Raiklin said the two men are planning to attend the Sheriffs Association of Texas’ annual conference in Fort Worth, Texas, this month and pitch their plan. “I would say that my inbox has been interesting lately with the amount of sheriffs that have an interest in seeing Texas uphold the United States Constitution, and preserve the way of life that we’ve come to expect as constitutionally guaranteed,” Evans said during the press conference. But Mack said Raiklin’s score is currently 0. “I know a lot of sheriffs, especially in Texas,” Mack told Raw Story. “I do not believe he has a single sheriff aligned with him. He’s never been able to give me a name.” ‘It’s so easy to learn where they live’ While cultivating relationships with members of Congress, lobbying sheriffs and recruiting volunteers to join posses tasked with detaining political enemies, Raiklin has also forged relationships with other extremists, seeming to cast about for a legal rationale in support of his scheme. Over the past six months, Raiklin has appeared on at least three podcasts with Dr. Pete Chambers, who helped organize a “Take Our Border Back” convoy earlier this year to support Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s defiance of the federal government. Like Raiklin, Chambers is a retired lieutenant colonel who formerly served in the Army Special Forces. Following his retirement from the military and later, in 2022, from the National Guard, Chambers joined the “sovereign citizen” group Republic of Texas, whose members shot a man and took him hostage in 1997. Chambers said when he watched Raiklin’s viral video outlining his plan to carry out “live-streamed swatting raids” against his “Deep State target list,” he recalled that he said to himself: “Ivan, you’ve just kicked open the door, and we’re going to have to back your play. And we can. And we’ve got the receipts to do it.” During the conversation between the two men, Chambers referenced something called “the doctrine of lesser magistrates.” Although the term is rooted in the 16th century Protestant Reformation in Europe, it was more recently popularized by Matthew Trewhella, a Wisconsin pastor who has advocated killing abortion doctors. Michael Flynn has recommended Trewhella’s 2013 book, The Doctrine of the Lesser Magistrates: A Proper Resistance to Tyranny and a Repudiation of Unlimited Obedience to Civil Government, as “a masterful blueprint showing Americans how to successfully resist tyranny.” Trewhella’s book also received a plug at the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association convention where Raiklin attempted to sell the sheriffs on his “live-streamed swatting raids” plan. Chambers seemed to acknowledge the improvisational nature of applying a 16th century religious doctrine to an ideological battle with Trump’s political adversaries in the United States of America in 2024. “We’re building a plane and flying it here, I would say,” he said. “However, it is legal, moral and ethical…. If we can get together and develop the alliances of these sheriffs, then we decrease the space that these people can then maneuver.” ‘Gonna face those guns’ Next week, barring something cataclysmic, Trump will officially become the Republican Party’s 2024 presidential nominee. Trump will become the nominee despite being convicted of 34 felonies in the Stormy Daniels hush-money case in Manhattan, and he still faces dozens of additional federal and state charges despite a recent Supreme Court ruling that granted Trump — and any future president — immunity from criminal prosecution for “official acts” they took as president. Trump is as defiant as ever. “I did nothing wrong. We’d have a system that was rigged and disgusting. I did nothing wrong,” Trump said June 27 in his debate against Biden. On a parallel track, Raiklin’s embrace of lawlessness appears to be growing stronger. In June, Raiklin published a 76-minute video of himself speaking with Cliven Bundy, a 78-year-old Nevada rancher who is perhaps the ultimate icon of the far-right anti-government movement. In 2014, Bundy’s refusal to pay grazing fees to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management led to an armed standoff between the FBI and militia members, along with other supporters, including Richard Mack from the CSPOA. Raiklin flattered Bundy during the exchange as “quite the legend,” while describing the federal government as “the most corrupt institution on the planet.” The two men agreed that “the militia” — a term used to describe armed citizens — “puts a check on the federal government.” The rhetoric used by the two men became increasingly confrontational, with Bundy accusing the federal government of plotting to kill Americans. Cliven Bundy noted that his son, Ryan Bundy, was wounded, and a friend, LaVoy Finicum, was killed during a traffic stop during the Malheur National Forest occupation in Oregon in 2016. “They don’t have those bullets to fight our enemy across the border,” Bundy charged. “They’ve got those bullets to kill us in America.” Raiklin then quoted the Bible to suggest the proper response was “an eye for an eye.” Bundy lamented that sheriffs across the country did not heed his call in 2014 for them to disarm federal agents in their jurisdictions. “I said, ‘If you don’t disarm them, one of these days you’re going to face those guns,’” Bundy recounted. “Now, we’re getting closer,” he quickly added. “Gonna face those guns.” Raiklin, in response, appeared to advocate for doxing federal agents. “Oh yeah, we’re not only going to do that,” he said. “Again, they’re going to experience the most peaceful, legal and moral, ethical and patriotic endeavor they’ve ever experienced in their life. Every one of them. Because we have tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people that will facilitate them experiencing that. “Because it’s so easy to learn where they live,” Raiklin continued. “Each one. Where their homes are. Who they’re related to. Where they frequent. What kinds of vehicles they own. What kinds of devices they own and that they emit GPS geo-tracking data. Which social media apps they use. We monitor all their communications.” NOW READ: Trump's far-right army is threatening bloodshed — believe them",

                    "text": "Opening statements are set to start Wednesday in the trial of award-winning actor Alec Baldwin, who is charged in the shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the film \"Rust.\" Baldwin has pleaded not guilty in the case. Jury selection Tuesday was marked by delays, with the questioning of the 70 potential jurors starting several hours later than expected. But by the end of the day, that pool had been winnowed to 16 jurors, 4 of whom are alternates. The 11 women and five men seated will hear the case over the coming weeks and decide whether to convict the 66-year-old actor.Here's what to know.What happened on the \"Rust\" set?Around 2 p.m. local time on Oct. 21, 2021, a prop firearm held by Baldwin went off, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza during a rehearsal in a small church on the set. Baldwin, the Western's star and coproducer, has said he pulled back the Colt .45's hammer, but did not pull the trigger. Authorities were called to the set at the Bonanza Creek Ranch and Hutchins was taken to the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque via helicopter, where she died of her injuries, according to the sheriff's office at the time.Authorities who searched the set recovered live ammunition. The New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator determined in 2022 that the incident was an accident.What charge does Alec Baldwin face?Alec Baldwin faces a charge of involuntary manslaughter, a felony. If convicted, he could face up to a year and a half in prison. He has pleaded not guilty.He was initially charged in January 2023 but prosecutors dismissed those counts three months later. Prosecutors again indicted Baldwin on a charge of involuntary manslaughter in January.Baldwin asked for the charge to be dismissed, but the judge overseeing the case rejected his request.Where is the trial, when does it start and how long will it last?Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer is presiding over the trial in New Mexico's First District Court, in Santa Fe.The judge set the trial calendar to run from July 9-19. Jury selection was completed Tuesday, which means opening statements are on tap for Wednesday. Courtroom proceedings are expected to conclude by July 19, after which the case will go to the jury for deliberations.Court begins at 8:30 a.m. MDT, 10:30 a.m. EDT. The judge said she expects court to break at 10:15 a.m. local time for lunch, then at 3:30 p.m.While cameras were not allowed in the courtroom during jury selection, the trial will be livestreamed.Will Alec Baldwin testify?Baldwin's attorneys have not said whether the actor will take the stand in his own defense. The actor has been in court for proceedings and is expected to attend every day.Who else is expected to testify?The state's witness list contains 44 names, while the defense lists 14 individuals as potential witnesses.While prosecutors wanted to call the film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the case, the judge ruled in June she could not be compelled to testify against Baldwin. She did not testify in her own defense. On the prosecution's list of dozens of potential witnesses is Joel Souza, the film's director who was also wounded in the shooting, along with several people who also also testified at Gutierrez-Reed's trial, such as Seth Kenney, who owned the prop weapons company that supplied the film's ammunition; Wyatt Mortenson, a stuntman on the film; and Gabrielle Pickle, a line producer.The defense's shorter list of potential witnesses includes David Halls, assistant director and safety coordinator; Ryan Winterstern, a producer who also testified in Gutierrez-Reed's trial; and other members of the crew, among others.Who is Halyna Hutchins, the victim?The Los Angeles-based Hutchins, 42, was a self-described \"restless dreamer\" and \"adrenaline junkie\" who grew up on a remote Soviet military base. The Ukranian-born cinematographer earned a degree in International Journalism from Kyiv National University and graduated from the American Film Institute conservatory. Widely regarded as a rising star, her work included \"Archenemy,\" starring Joe Manganiello, \"Blindfire\" and \"Darlin',\" which premiered at the SXSW film festival in 2019. Baldwin announced in 2022 he had settled a wrongful death lawsuit with Hutchins' family: her husband, Matthew Hutchins, and their son, Andros.Has anyone else been prosecuted in the case?Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the armorer who oversaw firearms on the set, was also charged with involuntary manslaughter. Though she pleaded not guilty, she was convicted in March and sentenced to 18 months behind bars after a trial overseen by the same judge overseeing Baldwin's case. Gutierrez-Reed was acquitted on a charge of tampering with evidence. Earlier, Halls pleaded no contest to unsafe handling of a firearm. Halls, who agreed to cooperate in the shooting investigation, received a suspended sentence of six months probation.The production company overseeing the movie was fined $136,000 fine, the maximum under state law, by New Mexico's Occupational Health and Safety Bureau over the incident.",

                    "text": "SANTA FE, N.M. — Jurors who will decide actor Alec Baldwin’s fate were to hear opening statements Wednesday, July 10, as his trial on involuntary manslaughter gets underway. On Tuesday prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed on 16 people for the jury, four of whom will be alternates. The jury is comprised of 11 women and five men, The Associated Press said. Baldwin, the lead actor and co-producer for the Western film “Rust,” is accused in the shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during a rehearsal on the set in October 2021. Previously: Alec Baldwin in court today; trial in fatal ‘Rust’ movie set shooting to start Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to the charge. Baldwin faces a sentence of up to to 18 months in prison if convicted. He has claimed the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware that it was loaded with a live round, he said he pulled back the hammer — not the trigger — and it fired. Director Joel Souza was wounded in the shooting. Movie weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was sentenced to 18 months in prison in April for the shooting. Prosecutors blamed Gutierrez-Reed for unwittingly bringing live ammunition onto the set of “Rust,” where it was expressly prohibited, and for failing to follow basic gun safety protocols. Prosecutors say they’ll present evidence that Baldwin went “off script” and failed to follow basic industry standards for firearms safety when he pointed the firearm at Hutchins. “At the end of the day, the prosecutor’s main theory is that this was a gun involved, and Baldwin had a gun in his hand, and it doesn’t matter if it’s a film set or hunting safety class, you’re responsible for what comes out of the end of the barrel,” John Day, a Santa Fe-based defense attorney and former prosecutor, told the AP. Baldwin attorney Alex Spiro probed prospective jurors on Tuesday for strong opinions about gun safety and asked whether a person must entirely take responsibility for whether a gun is loaded or may “rely on experts, does anybody have a problem with that?” Most who answered said they always treat a gun as if it were loaded.",

On Tuesday, Taliyah Clarke was rushed to Holtz Children’s Hospital in critical condition by her father. Police say, she was suffering from an apparent gunshot. The panic pouring out as the calls for help came in around noon. “Girlfriend advised father left. Black Nissan headed for JMH,” said a dispatcher over Broadcastify police scanner. The fathers car, parked outside of the hospital, was surrounded by crime scene tape. “Units responded to the hospital where they made contact with several individuals that are also in our custody,” said Miami Police Department Chief Manny Morales. During the day, crime scene investigators focused on the door to the ground-floor unit where little Taliyah was struck by gunfire. “Inside the unit, there is a scene. There’s blood splatter,” said a dispatcher over the Broadcastify police scanner. Officers stood guard at the door and closed down the street to map out the scene. As detectives worked the case, with few details emerging, authorities reassure the public that the shooting is an isolated situation. “I just want to assure the community no shooters are wanted at this time; there is nobody in the community that is posing a harm or threat,” said Morales. “I just ask everybody to please pray for this 11-year-old little girl who is in extremely critical condition and keep her family in your thoughts and prayers.” Police have yet to confirm what led to the shooting.

Charlene Webster, 59, Nancy Severe, 43, and Titato Clarke, 40, were taken into custody following the incident on Tuesday at approximately 12 p.m. at an apartment on 200 Northwest 17th Street. City of Miami Police initially responded to the scene after reports of a gunshot. Police said that upon arrival, officers were informed by Clarke, the victim’s father, that a loud pop was heard from the children’s room. Clarke reportedly told officers that he discovered his daughter, identified as Taliyan Clarke, suffering from a gunshot wound and transported her to Holtz Children’s Hospital in critical condition. Despite emergency surgery, the girl was pronounced dead at 1:09 p.m. The three adults, who were responsible for supervising the victim, gave inconsistent statements about the shooting, according to the arrest report. Titato, who, police said, has a history of 12 felony convictions, initially provided multiple conflicting accounts of the event. According to the arrest report, a search of the apartment revealed a .40 caliber casing and a Glock handgun wrapped in a scarf and blanket in the children’s bedroom, along with large pools of blood consistent with the shooting. Webster, the victim’s paternal grandmother, and Severe, Clarke’s romantic partner, who shares three children with him, were also residents of the apartment at the time. All three adults were arrested and charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child under 18. Please check back on WSVN.com and 7News for more details on this developing story.

On Wednesday, Miami Police announced they arrested three people on charges of aggravated manslaughter of a child in the shooting. Father Titato Hatzate Clarke, 40, grandmother Charlene Ann Webster, 59, and Titato Clarke's partner, 43-year-old Nancy Severe, were the three arrested. According to arrest reports, Titato Clarke and Webster said Taliyan Clarke was in her room with her 9-year-old brother when they heard a loud \"pop\" come from the room. They went in and found the girl suffering from a gunshot wound to her chest. She was rushed to a locl hospital in critical condition and died from the injury. Investigators went into the apartment and found a Glock handgun wrapped in a pink scarf and brown blanket in the childrens' bedroom, along with a bullet casing and large pools of blood, the reports said. When officers spoke with Titato Clarke at the hospital, he gave inconsistent stories about how his daughter had been shot, the reports said. According to the reports, the three adults lived at the apartment with Taliyan Clarke and three children shared by Titato Clarke and Severe. \"All three adults were residents of the apartment at the time of the shooting and shared responsibility for supervision of the victim,\" the reports said. A criminal records check showed Titato Clarke been convicted of 12 felonies, the reports said. Records show he's previously faced charges for sexual battery on a minor, aggravated battery on a pregnant woman, felony battery and false imprisonment. Titato Clarke, Webster and Severe were booked into jail, and were expected to appear in bond court on Wednesday.",

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed an executive order Tuesday to establish \"cell phone-free\" classrooms in all Virginia K-12 public schools. Executive Order 33 requires the state Department of Education to team up with partners to set guidelines for restricting phones in K-12 school classrooms by the fall, which would then be implemented by Jan. 1, 2025. The executive order highlighted mental health concerns among adolescents, including anxiety and depression, as a main factor behind the decision, stemming in part from teens' significant use of popular social media platforms, which, according to an American Psychological Association report published in April, is an average of 4.8 hours per day. The order also said students who use phones during school days tend to learn less and earn lower grades. The order suggested the use of pouches or dedicated cell phone \"lockers\" as potential ways students can store phones during school days. It also doesn't completely ban cellphones and stipulates that the education department needs to address processes for parents to communicate with their children in times of emergencies and for everyday issues, such as forgotten items and pick-up times. In a June op-ed, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called for warning labels on social media sites, similar to warning labels on tobacco products, in order to address \"the defining public health challenge of our time.\" Virginia's executive order comes one month after the board of the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second-largest school district, passed a ban on cellphones on June 18, which will take effect by the spring semester of the 2024-2025 school year. States like Florida, Indiana and Ohio have also passed similar laws, and several other states are considering doing the same with legislative proposals in the works.",

Glenn Youngkin has signed an executive order calling for the establishment of \"cellphone-free education\" in public schools in an effort to fight back against what he describes as an \"alarming mental health crisis and chronic health conditions affecting adolescents.\" The measure, which was signed by the Republican on Tuesday, orders state agencies and its Department of Education to come up with new guidelines that will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2025. \"The necessity of implementing cell-phone free education in Virginia’s K-12 public schools is increasingly evident,\" Youngkin wrote in the order. \"Parents, public health professionals, educators, and other stakeholders across the Commonwealth are expressing concern over the alarming mental health crisis and chronic health conditions affecting adolescents, such as depression and anxiety, driven in part by extensive social media usage and widespread cell phone possession among children. \"Cellphone-free education will significantly reduce the amount of time students can be on phones without parental supervision,\" he added. GOP-LED STATES ASK SUPREME COURT TO TEMPORARILY BLOCK BIDEN’S STUDENT LOAN HANDOUT PROGRAM Youngkin wrote in the order that children spend an average of nearly 5 hours a day browsing social media and that recent studies suggest adolescents who spend more than three hours per day double their risk of poor mental health. \"Most alarming is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from 2019-2021, reporting that the rate of suicide has increased 167% since 2010 for girls and 91% since 2010 for boys,\" as well as a \"spike in depression of 161% and 145%, respectively,\" he added. READ THE ORDER BELOW. APP USERS: CLICK HERE Youngkin also said \"up to now, public schools have often left these decisions and consequences\" surrounding cellphone use \"to individual teachers, resulting in a variety of expectations and enforcement, all too often leading to students frequently checking their devices, scrolling through social media, and sending direct messages.\" He argued, citing studies, that students who use their cellphones during class \"learn less and achieve lower grades.\" 3 COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY STAFF MEMBERS REMOVED AFTER ANTISEMITIC TEXT MESSAGE EXCHANGE The executive order suggests that usage of cellphone \"lockers\" or pouches could be one way to restrict them in schools. Last year, Florida became the first state to crack down on phones in schools with a new law. Indiana and Ohio passed their own laws this year, while several other states have recently introduced what is becoming known as \"phone-free schools\" legislation. In Virginia’s state capital of Richmond, Youngkin's order has the full support of the superintendent of public schools.

                    "text": "July 10 (UPI) -- Virginia has joined a growing list of states and other places seeking to limit or ban the use of cellphone and social media by young people in public schools. Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, on Tuesday signed Executive Order 33 which directs multiple state departments or officials, including Virginia's Education Department, to put in place new guidelines for a cell-free education by January next year. \"This essential action will promote a healthier and more focused educational environment where every child is free to learn,\" the governor said in a news release. \"Creating cellphone and social media-free educational environments in Virginia's K-12 education system will benefit students, parents, and educators.\" A draft is expected by August 15 with a final guidelines expected to be issued in September. While not an outright ban, it would restrict phones for public schools in grades K-12, and calls for ideas like the implementation of pouches or \"phone lockers\" while other protocols are figured out ahead of it's 2025 start. Youngkin cites the time spent by kids on their phones, an average of 5 hours, and the growing concerns over social media and its tie to mental health issues. It comes as the U.S. surgeon general in June called for warning labels on social media similar to those attached to cigarettes. \"Government cannot be the sole solution to this crisis,\" said Virginia's Education Secretary Aimee Guidera. At least 72% of U.S. high school teachers say cellphone distraction is a \"major problem in the classroom,\" according to a Pew Research Center report last week. \"School communities -- especially parents and teachers -- must work together to discuss and develop common sense approaches to limit screen time, prioritize open channels of communication, and re-establish norms that reinforce healthy and vibrant learning communities,\" stated Guidera. This arrives weeks after as the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second-largest school district, in a 5 to 2 school board vote in June banned students from their smartphones and social media during school, breaks and lunch. Following that, New York City's Public Schools Chancellor David Banks indicated during an interview that a similar plan like LA's could be in the works for New York's significantly large public school system in the city, calling phones not only distractions, but an addiction and a \"major issue,\" and that a formal announcement could happen at a later date. States like Ohio, Florida and Indiana have already passed similar laws with several other states actively considering similar steps, including New York which in June took steps to place some restrictions by limiting the amount of data social media companies can collect and use Meanwhile, California state lawmakers have introduced AB 3216 that would require California school districts to limit or ban cellphones at school as early as July 2026, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom recently calling for a statewide ban on smartphone use in California schools.",

Michael Bennet, D-Colo., confirmed reports that he told colleagues Biden would not win against former President Trump in November, just hours after lawmakers met on Capitol Hill for the first time since the first presidential debate of this year. \"This race is on a trajectory that is very worrisome,\" Bennet told CNN on Tuesday. \"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House.\" Biden is facing increased calls from members within his own party to step down as the Democratic nominee after his performance at the first presidential debate raised concerns over his health and mental fitness for the job. BIDEN INTERVIEWERS SHED LIGHT ON HIS FRAGILITY BEHIND THE SCENES: ‘IT’S IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO NOTICE' \"So, for me, this isn’t a question about polling. It’s not a question about politics. It’s a moral question about the future of our country,\" Bennet said. Bennet said voters have \"deep concerns\" about Biden's candidacy, and given the high stakes of the election, there are ongoing conversations regarding whether the president should remain the nominee. BIDEN TUNES OUT CRITICS WITH JAM-PACKED SCHEDULE KEEPING HIM ON THE MOVE \"We should be having a discussion about that. The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election,\" Bennet said. Vulnerable Democratic Sens. Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, reportedly also voiced to their colleagues in a closed-door meeting that they weren't confident in Biden's general election success, Axios first reported. Fox News Digital asked Tester on Capitol Hill whether the report was true, but he did not answer questions from reporters.

But information on where exactly power access had been regained was hard to come by, with no map available because of technical issues stemming from a storm in May, The New York Times reported.Instead, locals used Whataburger's website and app to track which of its restaurants — typically open 24 hours — were open, thus determining which areas had power.\"The Whataburger app works as a power outage tracker, handy since the electric company doesn't show a map,\" one person wrote in a post on X, which gained 11 million views.\"I really had to download the Whataburger app to keep up with the Houston power outage,\" another person posted.Many users pointed out the funny side of using Whataburger as a tracker, with one person writing: \"Using the Whataburger app to track power outages after a hurricane is probably the most Houston thing I can possibly imagine.\"The chain itself even weighed in, saying in response to one tweet: \"Well there's a use for our app we didn't think of! We hope you and everyone else are okay!\"Using Whataburger's app in such a way is not dissimilar to the so-called \"Waffle House Index,\" which is often used to measure the severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.Waffle House is well-known for staying open whatever the weather, so people know that if their local Waffle House is closed, then things must be bad.Whataburger CEO Ed Nelson told USA Today that the app only gives a \"general idea of power availability\" and that people who want to visit one of its restaurants should call ahead to check if it's open. One person posted on X that they had watched cars lined up in a Whataburger drive-thru that was lit up and looked like it was open, but there were no staff on-site. \"Each car takes turns sadly realizing this,\" they wrote.Business Insider has approached Whataburger and CenterPoint Energy for comment.As of Wednesday morning, CenterPoint Energy has released a tracking map showing where power has been restored. As of the early hours of Wednesday, more than 1.3 million customers were still without power.Beryl was the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. It strengthened to a Category 5 storm \"unusually early in the year,\" partly because of \"exceptionally warm ocean temperatures,\" the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. It became the earliest Category 5 hurricane observed in the Atlantic on record, with wind speeds of up to 165 miles per hour.It made landfall on Carriacou Island in the southern Caribbean on July 1, spread across the Caribbean, leaving devastation in its wake, and made landfall in Texas early on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane.Texas Acting Gov. Dan Patrick said on Tuesday that the state had been informed of three storm-related fatalities: Two by fallen trees and one by drowning. The AP reported on Monday that Beryl has caused at least 11 deaths.The US National Hurricane Center expects flash flooding on Wednesday in areas from southeast Michigan into northern New England, and some possible tornadoes.",

                    "text": "Whataburger, a cult-favorite chain among Texans, has become the unlikely source for power outage information following Hurricane Beryl’s lashing through the area Monday. The state’s main energy provider, CenterPoint Energy, experienced so much traffic, its outage app had technical difficulties loading, leaving residents to find other means of navigating loss of power and local business closures. The Whataburger app works as a power outage tracker, handy since the electric company doesn't show a map.Still nearly 1.9 million power outages. pic.twitter.com/d8srWmw1oV— BBQ Bryan (@BBQBryan) July 9, 2024 Bryan Norton, whose post on X about the app hack went viral, was able to ascertain the general pattern of outages across the city by looking at which Whataburger locations were open. A map on the chain’s app showed orange logos for open locations and gray ones for closed stores. Norton has been without power for over 27 hours and has been frequently checking various apps to find open businesses. “It gives you hope because you’re not alone,” the 30-year Houston resident told Fortune while he waited in line at his local Whataburger. “But it also shows how massively widespread this is.” Norton thought of using the Whataburger app for outage tracking on a trip home last week, when he and his wife stopped to get coffee. Google Maps told him a Starbucks location was open, but the Starbucks app said the location was closed—and ended up being correct. It’s a small comfort to Texans impacted by Monday’s Category 1 hurricane which knocked out power in 2.5 million homes and left eight people dead across Louisiana and Texas. As of Wednesday, over 1.6 million households in Houston and counties east of the city are still without power. The outages are an even greater inconvenience and danger amid a massive heat wave that caused temperatures in Houston to creep above 106 degrees. CenterPoint published a map on its website showing where power has been restored and will replace its outage map with cloud-based data to accommodate greater traffic by the end of the month, CenterPoint spokesperson Joshua Solis told Fortune. Whataburger plans to provide relief in the form of a food truck in the Houston area and will donate water to local shelters through the Red Cross. It said it currently has 106 locations in the greater Houston area open for drive-thru service only. “We’re glad the Whataburger app has been helpful to Houston residents to understand where power is available in the city,” Whataburger president and CEO Ed Nelson told Fortune in a statement. “Keep in mind, the app should only be used as a general idea of power availability. We encourage residents to call local units to see if they are open and operating.” Texans anointing Whataburger a beacon of knowledge on power outage updates follows an American tradition of fast-food chains being at the center of disaster responses. FEMA has long used the Waffle House Index to determine the intensity of natural disasters. If a Waffle House is open and has its full menu available, it likely has full power. “If you get there and the Waffle House is closed?” FEMA administrator Craig Fugate said. “That’s really bad. That’s where you go to work.” The ‘Energy Capital of the World’ vs. rampant outages Hurricane Beryl is the third major outage Norton has navigated this year, some because of extreme weather, and others because of freak accidents. The frequency of these outages has taught Norton and his fellow Texans to prepare for the worse. “The lines for the gas stations are still a block long because people are running out of gas for their generators,” he said, before hanging up so he could place his Whataburger order. Texans have had to adjust to the onslaught of outages impacting the state. Since 2019, there have been 293 outages, lasting about 160 minutes each and affecting an average of 172,000 people, according to a 2024 report by Payless Power using data from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). That makes it the state with the most power outages in the country. It’s not just hurricanes. A freak winter storm in 2021 plunged temperatures in Texas to record lows—below parts of Alaska—and killed hundreds of people across the state. A June 2023 tornado that ripped through East Texas left 200,000 buildings without power and destroyed 200 homes in the small town of Perryton. There’s some irony to the superlative. Houston has dubbed itself the “Energy Capital of the World,” home to 4,700 energy firms and employing one-third of the nation’s gas and oil extraction jobs. It’s also come under scrutiny for its above-ground power lines prone to toppling due to extreme weather. “Our (power) infrastructure was built for the weather of the past,” Michael Webber, professor of engineering at the University of Texas, told CNN. “It wasn’t built for the weather of the future, and the weather of the future is already here.” The whole country is dealing with an outdated grid: 70% of power lines in the U.S., built between the 1960s and ‘70s, are nearing the end of their lifecycle. As patterns of extreme weather increase, so, too, to vulnerabilities to a hobbled grid, Webber warned. Plans to bury power lines underground have slowly come to fruition. In January, the Energy Department announced $34 million in funding for 12 projects across 11 states to improve the grid. But the changes aren’t always popular. The undertaking is expensive, and a $5.9 billion project to bury the lines to prevent California wildfires was met with resistance from state regulators who balked at its cost. In Texas, infrastructure could be better prepared to navigate the hurricane-prone area, Norton admitted, though he doesn’t discount the locals’ ability to weather storms. “Texans get together, and we support each other,” he said. “And that’s what you need to do with any kind of disaster.”",

                    "text": "HOUSTON >> About 1.5 million customers remained without power in Texas on Wednesday, two days after Hurricane Beryl raked the state, as progress to restore electricity was slow, hampering efforts to quickly restart critical oil infrastructure. The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on Monday near the coastal town of Matagorda, about 100 miles (160 km) from Houston, lashing Texas with heavy winds that knocked down power lines and damaged property. “When you don’t have power, when it’s pitch black at night, when it’s as hot as 80 (degrees Fahrenheit/26.6 C) during the day, and you don’t have access to food you normally have, it’s a miserable situation,” Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick told a press conference on Wednesday in Matagorda. About 1.3 million of the 1.5 million houses and businesses without power are customers of CenterPoint Energy, the state’s largest provider. CenterPoint said on Wednesday it had restored power to some 980,000 customers in the previous 24 hours, adding that it would reach 1 million re-established customers by the end of the day. In a letter to CenterPoint on Wednesday, congresswoman Sylvia Garcia said the firm’s inability to restore power more quickly was creating a public health crisis. “Hospitals are now unable to send patients home where they lack power for medical equipment or an appropriately cool environment for their conditions.” Among Texas’ most affected zones by wind damage and lack of power were cities from Lake Jackson and Galveston on the coast to Houston, including energy hubs Freeport and Texas City, according to officials and CenterPoint’s outages map. Chemical manufacturer Olin declared force majeure over shipping of some product and aromatics, saying that Beryl had caused damage to its Freeport facilities, impacting production and access to power, raw materials, and feedstocks. “The duration of this disruption is uncertain,” it said in a statement. Also in that area, Freeport LNG, the second largest U.S. liquefied natural gas terminal, was preparing to resume processing by Thursday, two sources close to the matter said, as power was being restored. But LNG exports from the terminal are not expected to restart until the port, which is operating under restrictions, fully reopens for vessel traffic. A spokesperson for Freeport LNG told Reuters the company “intends to resume liquefaction when post-storm assessments are complete and it is safe to do so.” PORTS, PLATFORMS REOPENING Refineries, offshore production sites and ports saw limited damage and were largely returning to normal operations. Two refineries in Texas City, Texas, one operated by Marathon Petroleum and the other by Valero Energy Corp , were in operation on Wednesday morning, according to a Reuters eyewitness. The Port of Freeport said on Wednesday the navigation channel had reopened to vessels with drafts up to 36 feet (10 meters). The port, which moved its first ship, added that survey would determine when the channel would be cleared for operations without restrictions. “All Port Freeport entrance gates have resumed normal operating hours. Utility crews are on-site making repairs to downed power lines,” it said. The Port of Houston said its eight public terminals had resumed operations on Tuesday for vessel operations, and on Wednesday returned to normal start times for gate operations. Houston Pilots, which provides services to ships entering or departing the port, moved 14 ships inbound on Tuesday and was expecting 25 inbound and five outbound vessels on Wednesday. At the Port of Galveston, cruise ships began to sail while cargo operations were expected to resume on Wednesday. The port, which maintains draft restrictions for vessels, experienced relatively minor damage and some power outages, said Rodger Rees, Galveston Wharves port director. “Power remains out for areas of the port and the city. Port staff is working closely with the city to get power fully restored,” the ports said on a social media update. U.S. oil producer Chevron said on Wednesday that output from its operated Gulf of Mexico assets remained at normal levels. DAMAGES MOUNTING Reinsurance broker Gallagher Re estimated that U.S. economic losses from Beryl would be at least $1 billion as damage assessments continue. Weather forecasting firm AccuWeather issued a preliminary estimate of $28 billion to $32 billion in U.S. damage and economic loss. State officials promised cooling stations, hospital beds and a plan to remove debris. President Joe Biden on Tuesday approved a major disaster declaration for Beryl. With local stores running out of power generators for sale, many Texans resorted to their trucks to power appliances and small equipment at home. A Ford Motor spokesman said the automaker saw a 1,300% increase from customers in the Houston region generating at least 1 kilowatt of power with their built-in F-150 pickup truck mobile generators.",

                    "text": "Yesterday (July 9), rapper Rich The Kid stressed Kanye West fans all the way out when he shared a screenshot from a text message thread he said was between Rich and Kanye. In it, Kanye appears to contemplate retirement, writing, “I am retiring from professional music. Not sure what else to do.” Rich responds with words of encouragement, telling Ye, “The ppl NEED you.” So, is Kanye West actually retiring from music? It doesn’t seem to be out of the realm of possibility. There’s a sense of helplessness behind his message, which could stem from the producer’s recent album distribution struggles. His collaborative album with Ty Dolla Sign, Vultures, was delayed multiple times, then split into three parts, but since announcing its triple album status, Ye has only been able to drop one installment, missing the targeted release dates for the follow-ups, and never really announcing any new ones. That first part was seemingly only released because West and Ty were able to sneak it into a distributor’s system, but it was promptly removed from some DSPs, and since then, Ye has appeared to be unable to secure another distributor. At one point, he contemplated releasing it directly through his own website or app, but those plans have apparently fallen through — and generated a lawsuit, to boot. However, all of this might just be moot speculation. Later the same day, Rich quoted XXL‘s tweet about Kanye’s “retirement” to admit it was all just a marketing ploy. Kanye West appears on Rich’s new album, Life’s A Gamble, which drops next Friday, July 19. While the ol’ fake retirement is a tried-and-tested formula (that rarely actually works, by the way), that doesn’t mean Kanye isn’t getting out of the music biz — after all, he still has yet to even announce a solid release date for Vultures 2 — let alone actually releasing it — so he might as well be retired already for all intents and purposes.",

                    "text": "Is Kanye West waving his white flag to the music industry? According to Rich The Kid, the rapper/producer, 47, allegedly declared that he’s retiring from music, though it’s unclear what exactly that entails or if the decision is final. Per a since-deleted screenshot of a text exchange posted by Rich The Kid, 31, on Tuesday, July 9, West (now known professionally as Ye) wrote, “I am retiring from professional music.” His reason? All the musician hinted is that he’s “not sure what else to do” as far as music goes. However, Rich The Kid replied with outrage, “Retire? Why? How? The ppl NEED you the music you & Ty & we have made was the BIGGEST STAMP in culture to this date in 2024. Drop Ye about mine & V@ and we do it all over again the kids need you big bra fasho maybe some time to chill but retiring ain't it.\" PEOPLE reached out to a rep for West for comment. Shortly after he posted the screenshotted-texts, Rich The Kid announced on X (formerly Twitter) that he’s dropping new music with West featured on his forthcoming album, Life’s a Gamble. “ACTUALLY WE DROPPING FRIDAY ??????? 7/19,” he wrote, confirming the project’s release date. According to the album’s track list, there’s an upcoming collaboration with West titled “Plain Jane,” plus the already-released single “Gimme a Second 2” featuring Ty Dolla $ign and Peso Pluma. There’s also the track “Carnival” with Playboi Carti and Ty Dolla $ign, 42, that was featured on the latter’s collaborative Vultures 1 album with West, which dropped in February. It peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 the following month. West’s alleged retirement announcement comes weeks after he and Ty Dolla $ign were slated to release their sequel project, Vultures 2, on Friday, May 3. Thanks to their first album together, the duo (known as ¥$) received a 2024 BET Award for best group. According to an Instagram post shared by Ty Dolla $ign, the pair are next set to bring their Vultures listening experience to Korea on Friday, Aug. 23. However, it’s unclear if they’ll perform their follow-up project, which still doesn’t have a confirmed release date. In his recent Billboard cover story, though, Ty Dolla $ign said Vultures 2 is almost done and could drop any day now.",

                    "title": "Nirvana Settles Lawsuit Against Marc Jacobs Over Band&#8217;s Smiley Face Logo",
                    "text": "A legal battle over Nirvana‘s iconic smiley face logo will end in a settlement, resolving years of sprawling litigation between the band, fashion designer Marc Jacobs and a former Geffen Records art designer who claims he created it. In a notice filed in Los Angeles federal court on Tuesday, attorneys for all three sides said they had accepted a mediator’s proposal to end the long-running case over the logo, which has appeared on countless t-shirts and other merch in the years since Kurt Cobain’s death. Attorneys told Judge John A. Kronstadt that they would formalize the settlement within 21 days, and the judge later removed all upcoming hearings and other deadlines. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, and each side did not return a request for comment. Nirvana’s logo – a yellow smiley face with X’d-out eyes — first appeared during promotion for 1991’s Nevermind. The design eventually became something of an unofficial emblem for the band, and has become particularly prominent again in recent years amid a wave of 90s nostalgia among younger music fans. The band’s lawyers first sued Marc Jacobs in 2018, accusing the design house of using a look-alike image on a line of its own t-shirts and other apparel called “Bootleg Redux Grunge.” They said Jacobs had just replaced “Nirvana” with the word “Heaven” and replaced the two eyes with an “M” and a “J,” but had changed little else. “Defendants’ use of Nirvana’s copyrighted image on and to promote its products is intentional, and is part and parcel of a wider campaign to associate [the Grunge line] with Nirvana, one of the founders of the ‘grunge’ musical genre,” the band’s attorneys wrote at the time. In their initial complaint, Nirvana’s lawyers said the smiley face had been created by the late Cobain – the conventional wisdom for decades about the logo’s origins. But soon after the case was filed, a former Geffen art director named Robert Fisher jumped into the case: “It is, in fact, Mr. Fisher, who authored the Happy Face, not Mr. Kurt Cobain.” “For 30 years now, Nirvana has reaped enormous profits from Mr. Fisher’s works through the sale of a wide range of products,” his lawyers wrote. “Assisted by a team of lawyers and managers, Nirvana was able to do so without any compensation to Mr. Fisher by falsely claiming authorship and ownership.” Since Fisher entered the case, the band’s lawyers have staunchly maintained that it was Cobain who designed the image. At the very least, they’ve argued, if it was Fisher who created the image, he did so when he was employed by Geffen at the time – meaning it was a “work for hire” and the label retained all rights to the image. In December, Judge Kronstadt largely agreed with Nirvana on that issue. Fisher later sought to appeal that ruling, but the judge denied that motion last month, saying he would need to wait until after Nirvana and Marc Jacobs went to trial to file an appeal.",

                    "title": "Nirvana, Marc Jacobs Settle Copyright Suit Over T-Shirt That Allegedly Ripped Off Smiley Face Logo",
                    "text": "After several years, and a few unexpected twists, Nirvana and Marc Jacobs have settled a copyright dispute over the band’s smiley face logo, which also raised questions about the origins of the famous symbol. Nirvana first brought the suit in Dec. 2018, accusing Marc Jacobs of copyright and trademark infringement over a T-shirt they said ripped off the band’s signature happy face design — with X’d out eyes, squiggly smile, and tongue sticking out. The Marc Jacobs shirt (which was part of the fashion company’s “Bootleg Redux Grunge” collection) featured the letters M and J for eyes, instead of X’s; and the word “Nirvana” was replaced by “Heaven,” with a type-face roughly similar to the one long-used by Nirvana. According to Nirvana lore, late frontman Kurt Cobain created the smiley face logo, but Marc Jacobs eventually filed a countersuit calling that claim into question. Their suit noted that surviving members, Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic, previously testified in depositions that they did not know who made the smiley face. And soon an alternate artist, former Geffen Records art director Robert Fisher, entered the fray, claiming he came up with the logo. “For 30 years now, Nirvana has reaped enormous profits from Mr. Fisher’s works through the sale of a wide range of products,” Fisher’s lawyers previously wrote (via Billboard). “Assisted by a team of lawyers and managers, Nirvana was able to do so without any compensation to Mr. Fisher by falsely claiming authorship and ownership.” In a joint court filing yesterday, July 9, all three parties confirmed that they’d agreed upon a settlement. No details were given, with the filing only stating that everyone had agreed to a “Mediators Proposal” submitted by a magistrate judge, Steve Kim. The parties are currently in the process of drafting a proper settlement agreement, which will be completed over the next three weeks. Lawyers for Nirvana, Marc Jacobs, and Fisher did not immediately return Rolling Stone’s requests for comment. It’s unclear whether the settlement will make any particular statement on the origins of the smiley face logo — and, if it does, whether that information will be made public. After Fisher entered the case, Nirvana’s lawyers rebuffed his authorship claim and insisted that Cobain designed the logo. They also put up the argument that, even if Fisher did draw the logo, it was while he was a Geffen employee, meaning the label would retain the rights to the design. That argument earned the approval of the judge overseeing the case in a ruling last December. Fisher had planned to appeal, but the judge said at the time that he would have to wait until Nirvana and Marc Jacobs’ original lawsuit went to trial.",

                    "text": "Two Nasa astronauts from Boeing’s troubled Starliner capsule might have to remain in space until the middle of August as engineers continue to work through technical problems that prevented their return in June. Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore have been aboard the international space station (ISS) since 6 June after the first crewed docking of the next-generation spacecraft. The test mission was scheduled to last about a week, but Starliner’s undocking was delayed several times as faulty thrusters and then a series of small helium leaks raised safety concerns. On Wednesday, Nasa announced that it was still performing tests to ensure the capsule would perform as expected, and although the space agency was confident the craft would be safe for an emergency evacuation, mission managers were not yet ready to schedule its departure. “Some of the data suggests optimistically, maybe it’s by the end of July, but we’ll just follow the data each step at a time,” Steve Stich, Nasa’s commercial crew program manager, said at a lunchtime press conference. “We’re going to work methodically through our processes, including a return flight readiness review with the agency, before we get the go to proceed towards undocking and landing. This is a very standard process.” He added that a routine ISS crew rotation in mid-August was “kind of a back end” to the mission to avoid overcrowding in orbit. “Obviously, a few days before that launch opportunity we would need to get Butch and Suni home on Starliner,” he said. But he noted that the space station, currently occupied by a regular crew of seven in addition to the two Starliner astronauts, had sufficient supplies and resources, and there was no risk to anybody aboard. That, he said, gave engineers time to perform ground fire evaluations of replica thrusters at Nasa’s White Sands test facility in New Mexico, and close out the helium leak issues he believed could be signed off by the end of this week. Mark Nappi, vice-president and program manager of Boeing’s commercial crew program, told reporters that he was confident the Starliner program would emerge stronger because of the issues. “All this information is going to go in a big bucket, and all the engineers are going to review it and try to see if it doesn’t point to root cause or point to some additional testing that we can do in the future to eliminate this problem once and for all,” he said. Although Boeing’s space operations are separate from its aviation wing, the ongoing problems with Starliner have added to the company’s recent public relations crisis, sparked by the crash of two 737 Max airliners and a number of other safety related incidents. Despite being years behind schedule and more than $1.5bn over budget when it launched from Florida on 5 June, Starliner was intended to restore some of the company’s lost luster and offer Nasa a second private commercial crew alternative for the transportation of astronauts in lower earth orbit to SpaceX’s Dragon capsule. If the current test mission concludes successfully, Starliner capsules, known officially as CST-100 (crew space transportation), will operate six further astronaut rotation flights to the space station as part of Nasa’s commercial crew program. Wilmore, speaking from the ISS earlier on Wednesday, said he and Williams were enjoying their “extra” time in space, and were unconcerned by the technical problems. “This is the world of test. This is a tough business that we’re in, human spaceflight is not easy in any regime, and there have been multiple issues with every spacecraft that’s ever been designed,” he said. “We are very close friends with those that are making these decisions, and we trust them. We trust their integrity, we trust their technical acumen, and we trust that the tests that we’re doing are the ones that we need to do to get the right answers to give us the data that we need to come back.”",

                    "text": "Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft remains docked to the International Space Station (ISS) while engineering teams on the ground carry out tests to better understand the spacecraft. The mission was originally slated for a week in space, but now NASA hopes to return a crew of two astronauts on board the Starliner by no earlier than the end of July. Boeing’s Starliner capsule launched atop United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rocket on June 5, carrying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. Since its shaky docking to the space station, Starliner’s performance during its ascent has raised concern that the spacecraft might not be able to transport its crew back to Earth. “I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem,” Williams said during a news conference from the ISS on Wednesday. During its approach to the space station, five of Starliner’s thrusters failed, of which four were recovered.Starliner also developed five helium leaks, one of which had been identified prior to its launch. The engineering teams believe the leaks may be related to the activity of the thrusters. The mission was originally scheduled for eight days, but the crew’s return has been delayed several times while ground teams conduct tests on the vehicle and collect data before giving the green light for the astronauts to return to Earth. Despite the several delays, NASA has constantly reassured the media that the astronauts are not stranded in orbit, and that Starliner can undock from the ISS at any point and return the crew safely. This prolonged stay in space, NASA officials insist, is a choice. “We have a nice opportunity to almost use the International Space Station as a temporary hangar to take our time and understand the spacecraft before we undock and return,”Steve Stich, manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, told reporters on Wednesday. The Crewed Flight Test is part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program and is meant to transport crew and cargo to and from the International Space Station (ISS) under a $4.3 billion contract with the space agency. NASA’s other commercial partner, SpaceX, has so far launched eight crews to the space station. This week, NASA and Boeing started testing a brand new unit of the Starliner spacecraft at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico in an attempt to replicate the thruster issues encountered during its flight. “The temperatures we’ve been able to achieve are not quite what we would have hoped for based on the flight data,” Stich admitted. “The teams are off looking at that data and trying to determine the next steps.” For now, Starliner is sitting pretty in orbit but it will need to come down eventually. The ISS crew is due for a handover in mid-August, with NASA’s Crew-9 set to launch to orbit on board SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft (I know, so awkward). Astronauts Wilmore and Williams will need to depart from the ISS before that happens. “I think we’re really working to try to follow the data and see when’s the earliest that we could target for undocking and landing,” Stich said. “I think some of the data suggests, optimistically, maybe it’s by the end of July, but we’ll just follow the data each step at a time, and then at the right time, figure out when the right undocking opportunity is.” Despite this much uncertainty about a return date, NASA still insists that Starliner is ready to go home at any moment. “The prime option today is to return Butch and Sunny on Starliner,” Stich said. “Right now, we don’t see any reason that that wouldn’t be the case.”",

Despite being years behind schedule and more than $1.5bn over budget when it launched from Florida on 5 June, Starliner was intended to restore some of the company’s lost luster and offer Nasa a second private commercial crew alternative for the transportation of astronauts in lower earth orbit to SpaceX’s Dragon capsule. If the current test mission concludes successfully, Starliner capsules, known officially as CST-100 (crew space transportation), will operate six further astronaut rotation flights to the space station as part of Nasa’s commercial crew program. Related: Two US astronauts stuck in space as Boeing analyzes Starliner problems Wilmore, speaking from the ISS earlier on Wednesday, said he and Williams were enjoying their “extra” time in space, and were unconcerned by the technical problems. “This is the world of test. This is a tough business that we’re in, human spaceflight is not easy in any regime, and there have been multiple issues with every spacecraft that’s ever been designed,” he said. “We are very close friends with those that are making these decisions, and we trust them. We trust their integrity, we trust their technical acumen, and we trust that the tests that we’re doing are the ones that we need to do to get the right answers to give us the data that we need to come back.”",

                    "text": "Sen. Michael Bennet on Tuesday gave the harshest public assessment yet among Senate Democrats of President Joe Biden’s candidacy, telling CNN that he believes Biden “cannot win” in November, in line with prior reporting by the network on what he told his Democratic colleagues in the Senate during a private lunch meeting in the Capitol earlier in the day. “I just think this race is on a trajectory that is very worrisome if you care about the future of this country,” Bennet told The Source anchor Kaitlan Collins, as internal discord in the Democratic Party over Biden’s candidacy stretches into its second full week. “Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.” While polls have generally shown Biden losing to Trump in most battleground states, Bennett said that was irrelevant to him. “For me, this isn’t a question about polling. It’s not a question about politics. It is a moral question about the future of our country,” he explained. “And I think it’s critically important for us to come to grips with what we face if, together, we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.” CNN reported Tuesday that Montana Sen. Jon Tester and Ohio’s Sherrod Brown also voiced their doubts about the 81-year-old president’s ability to be re-elected. Thus far, no senators have outright called on Biden to end his campaign. “This is something for the president to consider,” Bennet said Tuesday. “I think it’s really hard for the people that are working for him to acknowledge. I think they have a moral obligation to look themselves in the mirror and to be able to say, ‘we know we can win this race.’” Still, Bennet warned that “a huge tragedy” looms. “If we just sit on our hands, if we say we’re going to disregard what is plainly in front of us–and plainly in front of the American people–and we end up electing Donald Trump again as president of the United States, that’s going to be a huge tragedy beyond epic proportion,” he warned. “It’s something I can’t live with.”",

The fall schedule gets an early start with “The New York Times Presents: Lie to Fly,” premiering Aug. 23 at 10 p.m. ET/PT. The film follows the investigation of a professional pilot accused of trying to crash an Alaska Airlines plane mid-flight. That’s followed by the premiere of Brian Jordan Alvarez’s comedy series “English Teacher” on Sept. 2 at 10 p.m. ET/PT. The show centers around Alvarez’s Evan Marquez, a high school teacher in Austin, Texas, who often finds himself at the intersection of the personal, professional and political aspects of working at a high school. The Jeff Bridges-led drama series “The Old Man” will return for Season 2 on Sept. 12 — more than two years since its Season 1 finale. The new episodes follow former CIA agent Dan Chase (Bridges) and former FBI Assistant Director Harold Harper (John Lithgow) on their most important mission to date — saving Emily Chase (Alia Shawkat) after she is kidnapped by Faraz Hamzad (Navid Negahban), a powerful Afghan tribal leader. With all three men claiming her as their daughter, Emily finds herself in an identity crisis that has dire implications. Later, executive producer Ryan Murphy returns with the new limited series “American Sports Story: Aaron Hernandez” at on Sept. 17.

Finally, the new docuseries “Social Studies” premieres Sept. 27. From Emmy-winning filmmaker Lauren Greenfield, the five-episode series delves into the lives of the first generation raised on social media. The logline for the show reads: “Filmed in Los Angeles over a school year, this groundbreaking social experiment features a diverse group of LA teens who open up their lives and phones to offer an intimate glimpse into how social media has reshaped childhood. From battling bullying, grappling with beauty standards, coping with racism, exploring sexuality, navigating the pressures of constant comparison, and making life-altering decisions, their compelling and relatable experiences take us on a raw, visceral and urgent journey through the challenges of growing up in the digital age.” Episodes for all series will stream on Hulu following their FX linear premieres.",

                    "text": "LONDON (AP) — British police said they found Wednesday the man suspected of killing the wife and two daughters of a BBC radio commentator near London and that the suspect is receiving medical treatment for his injuries. In a statement, Hertfordshire Police said 26-year-old Kyle Clifford has been found in the Enfield area of north London. The BBC has confirmed that the women killed were the family of its well-known radio racing commentator John Hunt. While the manhunt was underway, the public were urged not to approach Clifford, who is from the Enfield area in north London, around 52 kilometers (17 miles) to the east from the site of the killing. Armed police officers, forensic personnel and ambulance staff were seen at Hilly Fields Park in Enfield, which is popular with joggers and dog-walkers, and the adjacent Lavender Hill cemetery. The area has been closed off and an ambulance helicopter was also at the scene. Police have not confirmed whether the intense activity is connected to the manhunt as it is an ongoing investigation. Police said the three women — aged 25, 28 and 61 — were found seriously injured in a house in Bushey, northwest of London, on Tuesday evening. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene. The BBC confirmed the victims were Carol Hunt, wife of its commentator John Hunt, and two daughters, Louise Hunt and her older sister Hannah Hunt. John Hunt is the main racing commentator for BBC 5 Live, the corporation’s main news and sports radio channel. His voice is known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby. The Daily Mail newspaper and others reported that he found the bodies early Tuesday evening after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse south of London. As part of a note sent to BBC staff, the broadcaster described the incident as “utterly devastating” and that it will provide Hunt “with all the support we can.” Police did not say whether Clifford was connected to the women, but British media reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters. The BBC reported that Clifford left the British Army after a brief period of service in 2022. Local council member Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area where the killings took place is “a typical leafy British suburb.” “At about eight o’clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,” he told the BBC. Addressing the suspect directly, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said “Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.” Britain’s new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she is being kept “fully informed” about the “truly shocking” incident. People in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse. A spokesperson for the Home Office said Cooper will “swiftly consider” the findings from a recently launched review into whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced.

                    "text": "LONDON (AP) — British police said they found Wednesday the man suspected of killing the wife and two daughters of a well-known BBC radio commentator near London in a brutal crossbow attack. In a statement, Hertfordshire Police said 26-year-old Kyle Clifford was found in the Enfield area of north London, near his home, and that he is receiving medical treatment for his injuries. Police did not say how those injuries happened but stressed that they had not fired any shots. The BBC confirmed that the women killed were members of the family of its commentator John Hunt — his 61-year-old wife Carol Hunt and their daughters Hannah, 28, and Louise, 25. Footage from Sky News showed the suspect being carried on a stretcher out of Lavender Hill Cemetery in Enfield, which is close to his home and around 52 kilometers (17 miles) to the east from the site of the killings. Armed police officers, forensic personnel and ambulance staff had massed around the cemetery through the day. The public had been urged not to approach Clifford, who the BBC reported had been in the British Army for a brief period of service in 2022. “Following extensive inquiries, the suspect has been located and nobody else is being sought in connection with the investigation at this time,\" said Detective Inspector Justine Jenkins from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit. “This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the victims’ family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened,\" she added. Jenkins said the investigation is moving “at pace” and that formal identification of the victims is yet to take place. She also said that the “premature” naming of the victims “caused great upset.” Police had been scouring a park in north London, near the home of Clifford, after being alerted Tuesday about the killings in a house in Bushey, a residential area in northwestern London. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene. John Hunt is the main racing commentator for BBC 5 Live, the corporation’s main news and sports radio channel. His voice is known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby. A colleague of Hunt's and BBC 5 Live's lead presenter Mark Chapman struggled to hold back the tears as he expressed everyone’s shock and pain. “We have a football match to bring you tonight ... and we will start our buildup to it shortly but this has been a heartbreaking day,” he said as he opened Wednesday's coverage on 5 Live of England's semifinal match against The Netherlands in soccer's European Championship. “John Hunt is our colleague and our friend, not just to the current 5 Live sport team but to all of those who've worked here with him over the past 20 years, and also to all of you who have enjoyed his superb commentaries,\" Chapman said. \"So on behalf of everyone connected to 5 Live Sport, our love and thoughts and support are with John and his family.” The Daily Mail newspaper and others reported that Hunt found the bodies early Tuesday evening, after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse south of London. Police did not say how or whether Clifford, who is from London, was connected to the women, but British media had reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters. Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson suggested the attack was not random and that the suspect knew the family. Local council member Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, described the area as “a typical leafy British suburb” as he recounted his experience from the previous night. “At about eight o’clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,” he told the BBC.

Krueger's Finest Baked Goods have been recalled due to missing ingredient labels that should be on the packaging. The recall, originally made on June 19 and still active in all 50 U.S. states, has been given a Class II risk assessment by the FDA.Under the FDA's definition, a Class II recall is issued when \"a situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.\" C. Kreuger Gluten Free White Chocolate Cherry Oatmeal Cookies, sold in 2-ounce plastic sleeve packaging, containing 60 cookies per case. C. Kreuger Gluten Free Peanut Butter Cookies, sold in 2-ounce plastic sleeve packaging, containing 60 cookies per case. The FDA stipulates that the cookies can be stored for 30 days \"at ambient\" temperatures and for one year if frozen. In all, a combined 7,885 cookies are being recalled.Newsweek contacted C. Krueger's Finest Baked Goods outside of normal working hours via the contact form on its website for comment.Ingredients used in food products must be labeled on all products, although requirements can vary. Ingredients should be listed by weight in descending order and placed in the information panel on packaging.If a product is not labeled at all or incorrectly, it can pose a risk to those with food allergies and intolerances, as well as those with gut diseases like coeliac disease.Allergies cause an exaggerated immune system response in the body, which brings on symptoms on the skin like hives, itching, and rashes.Gastrointestinal issues can include vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping; as well as swelling of the throat and vocal cords, and respiratory issues such as coughing or wheezing.Serious allergic reactions can cause anaphylaxis, which can be fatal if not treated promptly. Symptoms can include a drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, and loss of consciousness. The FDA has said that \"symptoms of anaphylaxis may start out as relatively mild, but, if not treated promptly, symptoms can become life-threatening in a short amount of time.\"Millions of Americans have food allergies, with the FDA requiring that nine major allergens be clearly marked on all products to help people avoid foods that could trigger an allergic reaction. These allergens are: soybeans, milk, fish, crustacean shellfish, wheat, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts and sesame.Several cookie products have been recalled recently. Chocolate chunk cookies were recalled in numerous states in June due to containing an undeclared allergen. In April, the FDA announced a recall of macaron products sold in Lidl stores, again due to the presence of an undeclared allergen.",

                    "text": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified a previous food recall from Productos La Hacienda, a Texas-based company as Class I, its most severe level.The Edinburg-headquartered company initiated a voluntary recall of some of its cheese products—Queso Rico La Hacienda, El Queso Fresco De Veracruz and El Queso Rico 'La Hacienda' packaged in 9 oz, 1 pound and 2 pound plastic packages—on June 3 over possible contamination with a dangerous bacterium, Listeria monocytogenes.The presence of these pathogenic bacteria was found in a product having an expiration date of June 2, 2024, according to the FDA. The firm has begun removing all of its queso fresco products with all dates and sizes from their customers' shelves, the agency wrote.The queso fresco products had been distributed to 80 retail stores in three Texas counties in the Rio Grande Valley, Cameron County, Hidalgo County, and Starr County. The recall affected 640 pounds of cheese in total.While the recall was initiated last month, the FDA only identified the recall on Tuesday, July 9, as a Class I recall. This is the most severe type of recall issued by the agency, used when the consumption or exposure to the affected product can cause \"serious adverse health consequences or death.\"Newsweek contacted the FDA for comment by email early on Wednesday morning.A Class II recall indicates that the consumption of the recalled product can cause \"temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences.\" In case of a Class II recall, the probability of suffering serious adverse health consequences \"is remote,\" the FDA states. A Class III recall is given when consumption or exposure to the recalled product is unlikely to cause adverse health consequences.Productos La Hacienda has not issued a press release for this food recall, which is ongoing, according to the FDA. There is no report of any adverse health consequences reported by consumers who might have eaten the queso products.When people eat food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, they can contract a disease called listeriosis, which can last from days to several weeks, according to the FDA. While mild symptoms may include fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, more severe symptoms may present themselves in the form of headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and even convulsions.The disease can be fatal for very young children and the elderly, as well as the immunocompromised and individuals with chronic diseases. It can also be dangerous for pregnant women, leading to miscarriage and stillbirth.Symptoms of the disease normally appear within a few hours of consuming a contaminated product or two or three days after eating the contaminated food.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 1,600 people get listeriosis each year, and around 260 die.",

The products have now been classified under the FDA's highest risk level, Class I.A Class I recall is issued when there is a \"reasonable probability\" that the use of, or exposure to, a product could \"cause serious adverse health consequences or death.\" The classification was awarded on July 9 following the original recall date of June 24.Two products are included in the recall: 319 units of 7-Eleven Simply Chicken Salad Sandwich - 6.6oz 378 units of 7-Eleven Simply Egg Salad Sandwich - 6.8oz Both products come in \"flexible packaging,\" as per the FDA, and have a best by date of June 26.

Anyone who believes themselves or another person is suffering from anaphylaxis should dial 911 immediately.Symptoms of anaphylaxis include throat swelling, difficulty breathing, a sudden drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness.The FDA has three levels used to classify food product recalls, which indicate the health threat posed to members of the public. A Class II recall refers to a \"situation in which the use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.\"A Class III is awarded when \"a situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences.\"It is not the only recent recall linked to sandwiches.

                    "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Two NASA astronauts aboard the International Space Station, who were scheduled to return to Earth weeks ago, said Wednesday they were confident Boeing’s Starliner capsule can bring them home, after a series of technical issues caused their return from the International Space Station to be delayed for nearly a month. The two NASA astronauts were scheduled to return just over a week after arriving at the ... [+] International Space Station last month. Associated Press Key Facts Butch Wilmore, who arrived with Suni Williams on the ISS on June 6, said he and Williams were “absolutely confident” they could undock from the station and “figure out the best way to come home” on Boeing’s Starliner capsule “if we had to.” Wilmore and Williams were scheduled to leave the ISS on June 14, about eight days after arriving at the station. NASA is completing tests on Starliner’s thrusters at a facility in New Mexico, after five thrusters failed as the capsule approached the ISS, Boeing said earlier this month, though four of the thrusters have since been reactivated. Steve Stich, NASA’s commercial crew chief, said last month that testing could continue for “a couple weeks” or longer before NASA reviews the test data and schedules Starliner’s return.

Crucial Quote “We trust that the tests we’re doing are the ones we need to do to get the right answers, to give us the data that we need to get back,” Wilmore said. “I have a really good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem.” What To Watch For Stich said Starliner was approved to stay at the ISS for 45 days, meaning the latest the capsule could return is July 21, though he added NASA is considering extending the capsule’s mission to 90 days, delaying the latest possible return to Sept. 4. NASA officials will determine whether Starliner’s battery can be sustained for that long before making a decision, Stich said. Key Background Five days after arriving at the ISS last month, Boeing announced Starliner was experiencing five “small” helium leaks, though it wasn’t immediately clear how much helium was leaking. Despite the leak, Boeing said engineers determined the helium supply was sufficient to return Starliner to Earth. NASA delayed Starliner’s return multiple times in June, later announcing the capsule wouldn’t return until at least early July as the agency studied propulsion system issues. Both Williams and Wilmore have continued completing tests while aboard the ISS, according to Stich, who noted the two astronauts “aren’t stranded in space” and would return home “at the right time.” Surprising Fact Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft faced setbacks even before launching last month. An earlier launch attempt was delayed, after officials discovered a helium leak on Starliner’s service module. Boeing successfully docked an unmanned Starliner capsule at the ISS in 2022 after a series of technical failures, including oxidizer valves in the propulsion system that became stuck. In 2019, Starliner suffered software glitches that caused the capsule to become briefly stranded in orbit.

                    "text": "Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday left his supporters still guessing who he will choose as his running mate despite mounting speculation about the veepstakes. Speaking at a rally at his South Florida Doral golf resort near Miami, Trump only went so far as to praise Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), one of his VP finalists who was in attendance, as a “fantastic guy” and acknowledge the large amount of press present. “I think they probably think I’m going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice president because that’s a lot of press,” he said. Trump’s other finalists include Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) and Gov. Doug Burgum (R-ND), who were not in attendance. The presumptive GOP presidential nominee took a victory lap in the wake of last month’s debate, which left many Democrats questioning President Joe Biden’s political future and ability to defeat his predecessor over signs of advanced aging. Trump said he was eager to go another round with Biden on the debate stage but this time without the moderators. “Let’s do another debate this week so that sleepy Joe Biden can prove to everyone all over the world that he has what it takes to be president,” Trump told supporters. “But this time, it will be man to man, no moderators, no holds barred. Just name the place — anytime, anywhere.” The second debate is already scheduled to be hosted by ABC on Sept. 10. Trump also challenged Biden to an 18-hole golf charity match on Doral’s championship Blue Monster course. Trump offered to give the president 20 strokes and said should Biden win, he’ll donate $1 million to the charity of Biden’s choice. “It will be among the most watched sporting events in history,” Trump said. “May be bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters.” The Biden campaign rejected the challenge. “Joe Biden doesn’t have time for Donald Trump’s weird antics — he’s busy leading America and defending the free world,” Biden campaign spokesman James Singer said. “Donald Trump is a liar, a convict, and a fraud only out for himself — par for the course.” The two candidates got into a spat at the debate over their handicaps and who is the better golfer. The rally offered a debut of sorts for Trump’s youngest son, Barron, who attended. He received a standing ovation from the crowd upon being introduced by Trump. “You’re pretty popular. He might be more popular than Don and Eric,” Trump said, referencing his two other sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. “Barron, it’s good to have you. Welcome to the scene, Barron.”",

                    "title": "Biden&#8217;s Support on Capitol Hill Grimly Uncertain. A Seventh Democrat Says he Should Drop Out",
                    "text": "WASHINGTON — The mood on Capitol Hill turned grimly uncertain Tuesday as Democrats wrestled over President Joe Biden’s reelection and the extraordinary question before them — whether to stand behind his candidacy or push the president to bow out amid concerns over his ability to lead them to victory. House and Senate Democrats met privately with tensions running high. The conversation was “dour” and “sad” in the House, lawmakers said, as they discussed their party leader who emphatically refuses to step aside and implored them in a sharply worded letter to refocus from him to the threat posed by Republican Donald Trump. In the Senate, where Biden spent a storied career, they said even less. Late in the day, a seventh House Democrat, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, publicly called on Biden not to run for reelection, saying with Trump seeking to return to the White House, “the stakes are too high — and the threat is too real — to stay silent.” What could become a time for Democrats to bolster their president, who remains the favorite for some despite his poor debate performance and public appearances, instead fell deeper into crisis over real fears they could lose the White House and Congress and watch the rise of a second term Trump. Earlier, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said members had “an opportunity to express themselves in a candid and comprehensive fashion” at a closed-door session and the discussions would continue. It’s a remarkable moment for the president and his party with Democrats in Congress seriously questioning Biden’s place at the top of the ticket, weeks before the Democratic National Convention to nominate him for a second term. Biden’s supporters have been emerging as the most vocal, and at least one key House Democrat reversed course to publicly support the president. But no agreement was in sight and an undercurrent of dissent runs strong. As Senate Democrats stayed silent in public, Biden’s political future was the remarkable matter in question. Asked if there was any consensus, Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, one of Biden’s closest supporters, said the “consensus is that Donald Trump poses a threat and the focus should be on that.” In the private House meeting Tuesday, there was a growing concern that Biden remaining in the race means the election will center on his age issues instead of Trump, according to one of the people in the room. At least 20 Democratic lawmakers stood up to speak during the nearly two-hour session in what for many is an existential moment for their country considering a second Trump presidency. Most of those who spoke wanted Biden to end his candidacy, said another person granted anonymity to discuss the meeting. Among them was Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, who leads a contingent of military veterans in the House and is among the Democrats who have publicly called for Biden to step aside. Still others dropped their private concerns in order to back Biden, for now. “He said he’s going to remain in, he’s our candidate, and we’re going to support him,” said Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, on CNN. Over the weekend was among those privately saying Biden should not run. “I’m staying with Papa,” said Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y.. He said his constituents understand what the country went through during the COVID-19 pandemic and how Biden led through the crisis. “He was fit then and he’s fit now.” Many Democrats worry that not only is the presidency in jeopardy but also their own down-ballot races for control of the House and Senate — and the party’s ability to stop Trump and the conservative Project 2025 agenda with its plans to weaken the federal government. “He just has to step down because he can’t win,” said Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill. One Democratic lawmaker who declined to be named said afterward that people love Biden, but there’s a real sense of helplessness over the situation and the threat of the consequences if Democrats lose the elections. The lawmaker said the situation was “sad.” After a closed-door Senate lunch meeting, most senators were reluctant to say either that they unequivocally support Biden or that they want to see him step aside. “I think we should do our best job to defeat Trump and I’m really excited about it,” said Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. While there’s now more than a handful of House Democrats that have publicly called on Biden to end his candidacy, no Senate Democrat has publicly called for Biden to leave the race. The majority of Democratic senators who spoke during the lunch meeting expressed deep concerns about whether Biden can beat Trump in November, though they stopped short of saying he should step down from the race, according to a person familiar with the conversation and granted anonymity to discuss it. On CNN Tuesday night, Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado declined to say Biden should drop out but noted, “I have not seen anything remotely approaching the kind of plan we need to see out of the White House that can demonstrate that he can actually beat Donald Trump.” There were also a handful of senators who defended Biden. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York repeated, “I’ve said before, I’m with Joe.” Some are turning more serious attention to Vice President Kamala Harris as an alternative. Rep. Jared Huffman of California who is leading the House Democrats’ task force fighting Project 2025, said Democrats need to get back to confronting Trump and can win the election with Biden at the top of the ticket. But he said if Biden’s decision to stay on changes “that’s not the end of the world, in my view.” “I think we’ve got an excellent next up in the vice president. She’s good, and she’s ready to go.” Huffman said Democrats, unlike their House GOP counterparts, can “have principled disagreements without fighting like ferrets in a phone booth.” Republicans face their own history-making political situation, poised to nominate a former president who is the first ever to be convicted of a felony — in a hush money case — and who faces federal criminal indictments, including the effort to overturn the 2020 election he lost to Biden. After a slow initial response to Biden’s dismal debate, the White House and campaign team are working more furiously now to end the drama in part by gathering the president’s most loyal supporters to speak out. Biden spent part of his Tuesday evening speaking on a virtual call with more than 200 Democratic mayors, saying he will win reelection with “basic block-and-tackling” and boasting of the thousands of calls being made to voters, doors being knocked and signs being posted in support of his candidacy, according to a readout from his campaign. That came after the president met virtually late Monday with the Congressional Black Caucus, whose members are core to Biden’s coalition, thanking them for having his back, and assuring them he would have theirs in a second term. He was also to meet with the Congressional Progressive Caucus, whose leadership — along with that of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus — has said publicly they are sticking with the president. Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, a freshman Democrat, said there is too much at stake to turn away from Biden at this point in the campaign, saying a second Trump presidency would be extremely harmful to Black Americans across the country. “We are not willing to risk our freedoms for somebody feeling good because there’s a different name on the ballot,” she said. Having been on the campaign trail with Biden, Crockett added, “That is why I can feel so confident, because I have seen more than the 90 minutes that everybody is so concerned about.” And Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., who ended his long-shot 2024 Democratic presidential bid months ago, was asked by reporters if he felt vindicated by Democrats calling on Biden to step aside. “If this is vindication, vindication has never been so unfulfilling,” he said.",

Biden spent part of his Tuesday evening speaking on a virtual call with more than 200 Democratic mayors, saying he will win reelection with “basic block-and-tackling” and boasting of the thousands of calls being made to voters, doors being knocked and signs being posted in support of his candidacy, according to a readout from his campaign. That came after the president met virtually late Monday with the Congressional Black Caucus, whose members are core to Biden’s coalition, thanking them for having his back, and assuring them he would have theirs in a second term. He was also to meet with the Congressional Progressive Caucus, whose leadership – along with that of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus – has said publicly they are sticking with the president. Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, a freshman Democrat, said there is too much at stake to turn away from Biden at this point in the campaign, saying a second Trump presidency would be extremely harmful to Black Americans across the country. “We are not willing to risk our freedoms for somebody feeling good because there’s a different name on the ballot,” she said. Having been on the campaign trail with Biden, Crockett added, “That is why I can feel so confident, because I have seen more than the 90 minutes that everybody is so concerned about.” And Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., who ended his long-shot 2024 Democratic presidential bid months ago, was asked by reporters if he felt vindicated by Democrats calling on Biden to step aside. “If this is vindication, vindication has never been so unfulfilling,” he said.

                    "title": "Biden's Support on Capitol Hill Grimly Uncertain. A Seventh Democrat Says He Should Drop Out",
                    "text": "WASHINGTON — The mood on Capitol Hill turned grimly uncertain Tuesday as Democrats wrestled over President Joe Biden’s reelection and the extraordinary question before them — whether to stand behind his candidacy or push the president to bow out amid concerns over his ability to lead them to victory. House and Senate Democrats met privately with tensions running high. The conversation was “dour” and “sad” in the House, lawmakers said, as they discussed their party leader who emphatically refuses to step aside and implored them in a sharply worded letter to refocus from him to the threat posed by Republican Donald Trump. In the Senate, where Biden spent a storied career, they said even less. Late in the day, a seventh House Democrat, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, publicly called on Biden not to run for reelection, saying with Trump seeking to return to the White House, “the stakes are too high — and the threat is too real — to stay silent.” What could become a time for Democrats to bolster their president, who remains the favorite for some despite his poor debate performance and public appearances, instead fell deeper into crisis over real fears they could lose the White House and Congress and watch the rise of a second term Trump. Earlier, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said members had “an opportunity to express themselves in a candid and comprehensive fashion” at a closed-door session and the discussions would continue. It's a remarkable moment for the president and his party with Democrats in Congress seriously questioning Biden's place at the top of the ticket, weeks before the Democratic National Convention to nominate him for a second term. Biden’s supporters have been emerging as the most vocal, and at least one key House Democrat reversed course to publicly support the president. But no agreement was in sight and an undercurrent of dissent runs strong. As Senate Democrats stayed silent in public, Biden’s political future was the remarkable matter in question. Asked if there was any consensus, Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, one of Biden's closest supporters, said the “consensus is that Donald Trump poses a threat and the focus should be on that.” One Democrat, Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, said publicly what he told his colleagues in private — that he believes Trump “is on track win this election — and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House. Stopping short of calling for Biden to drop out, Bennet spoke forcefully on CNN about the danger of a second Trump presidency and said it’s up to the president “to consider” the options. He said he did not hear any other Senate Democrat call for Biden to leave the race. “It’s not a question about politics,” he said. “It’s a moral question about the future of our country.” In the private House meeting Tuesday, there was a growing concern that Biden remaining in the race means the election will center on his age issues instead of Trump, according to one of the people in the room. At least 20 Democratic lawmakers stood up to speak during the nearly two-hour session in what for many is an existential moment for their country considering a second Trump presidency. Most of those who spoke wanted Biden to end his candidacy, said another person granted anonymity to discuss the meeting. Among them was Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, who leads a contingent of military veterans in the House and is among the Democrats who have publicly called for Biden to step aside. Still others dropped their private concerns in order to back Biden, for now. “He said he’s going to remain in, he’s our candidate, and we’re going to support him,” said Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, on CNN. Over the weekend was among those privately saying Biden should not run. “I’m staying with Papa,\" said Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y.. He said his constituents understand what the country went through during the COVID-19 pandemic and how Biden led through the crisis. \"He was fit then and he’s fit now.” Many Democrats worry that not only is the presidency in jeopardy but also their own down-ballot races for control of the House and Senate — and the party's ability to stop Trump and the conservative Project 2025 agenda with its plans to weaken the federal government. “He just has to step down because he can’t win,” said Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill. One Democratic lawmaker who declined to be named said afterward that people love Biden, but there’s a real sense of helplessness over the situation and the threat of the consequences if Democrats lose the elections. The lawmaker said the situation was “sad.” After a closed-door Senate lunch meeting, most senators were reluctant to say either that they unequivocally support Biden or that they want to see him step aside. “I think we should do our best job to defeat Trump and I’m really excited about it,” said Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. While there's now more than a handful of House Democrats that have publicly called on Biden to end his candidacy, no Senate Democrat has publicly called for Biden to leave the race. The majority of Democratic senators who spoke during the lunch meeting expressed deep concerns about whether Biden can beat Trump in November, though they stopped short of saying he should step down from the race, according to a person familiar with the conversation and granted anonymity to discuss it. There were also a handful of senators who defended Biden. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York repeated, “I’ve said before, I'm with Joe.” Some are turning more serious attention to Vice President Kamala Harris as an alternative. Rep. Jared Huffman of California who is leading the House Democrats’ task force fighting Project 2025, said Democrats need to get back to confronting Trump and can win the election with Biden at the top of the ticket. But he said if Biden’s decision to stay on changes “that’s not the end of the world, in my view.” “I think we’ve got an excellent next up in the vice president. She’s good, and she’s ready to go.” Huffman said Democrats, unlike their House GOP counterparts, can “have principled disagreements without fighting like ferrets in a phone booth.” Republicans face their own history-making political situation, poised to nominate a former president who is the first ever to be convicted of a felony — in a hush money case — and who faces federal criminal indictments, including the effort to overturn the 2020 election he lost to Biden.

                    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Samsung is dressing up its wearable devices in technology’s latest fashion — artificial intelligence. The South Korean electronics giant on Wednesday revealed that both its first-ever premium smartwatch and a smart ring heralding its entry into a niche market will include AI features that are supposed to help people monitor and manage their health. Both the Galaxy Watch Ultra, priced at $650, and the Galaxy Ring, priced at $400, are extensions of a push that Samsung launched six months ago when it introduced its first smartphones to feature AI technology as a main attraction. The high-end smartwatch costs nearly twice as much as Samsung’s latest standard model, the Galaxy Watch 7, which will sell for $350. Tethering AI to people’s essential devices has become an accelerating trend. The technology already has been implanted on smartphones made by Google and Apple that compete against Samsung and also on the latest personal computers powered by Microsoft’s Windows software. The AI deployment on Samsung’s new premium watch and ring is narrowly focused on improving and maintaining personal health — the main reason most people buy wearable technology. Both Samsung’s watch and ring are leaning on AI to do a better job of analyzing biometric data collected from the person wearing the devices to customize assessments of their well-being through an “energy score” that will deliver ratings on a one to 100 scale and also make recommendations like a virtual fitness coach. Most of the information will be collected on the devices themselves. But some data will require analysis through data centers with security that Samsung likens to a virtual Fort Knox. The premium phone is the more sophisticated of Samsung’s latest wearable devices, capable of performing some functions — such as flagging sleep apnea — that the Galaxy Ring can’t. However, the ring requires less frequent recharging, equipped with a battery that can last six to seven days before needing to be replenished. But the smartwatch is also in a much more crowded market currently led by Apple, which has been intensifying its focus on health features since entering the market a decade ago. More than 60 million people already use the Samsung Health app that works in tandem with its smartwatches. The health benefits associated with wearable technology have helped spur more people to buy smartwatches, with worldwide sales of the devices expected to approach about $29 billion this year, based on a forecast by the research firm Gartner Inc. That translates to roughly 164 million new smartwatches being worn on wrists this year, with Gartner predicting the annual sales volume sold will rise to 195 million in 2028. Samsung is likely to face more challenges in the smart ring market, even though it won’t be facing much competition so far. The segment so far has been shaped by startups such as Oura and RingConn that haven’t made a significant dent so far. “Smart rings are still an emerging category with no exclusive use cases, with little expectations of growing beyond a niche market” through 2028, Gartner said in its recent overview of the wearable technology market. The firm expects a small segment that includes smart rings to generate $2.4 billion in sales this year and eventually rise to about $4.6 billion in 2028. Although it will come in nine different sizes, Samsung’s Galaxy Ring only fits with one kind of software — Google’s Android operating system. That locks out the mostly affluent consumers who own iPhones and often are interested in checking out new forms of technology such as the Galaxy Ring. Samsung also is rolling out its latest attempt to lure more people into buying a foldable phone equipped with two display screens that can be hinged together so the device can be turned into a pseudo-tablet. It’s a concept that Samsung has pushing since 2019 with minimal success, but the company is continuing to update the device with camera and AI features to feed the niche market. The next-generation model, the Galaxy Z Fold 6, will sell for $1,899.99.",

The effort stands no chance of advancing in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. To remove an official through this process, the House must vote to impeach and the Senate then must vote to convict. Democrats for years have criticized the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, over rulings that advanced causes popular on the right. These have included rolling back abortion rights, expanding gun rights, rejecting race-conscious collegiate admissions and ruling that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution for official acts in office in a decision favoring Donald Trump. Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement that Thomas and Alito’s “pattern of refusal to recuse from consequential matters before the court in which they hold widely documented financial and personal entanglements constitutes a grave threat to American rule of law.” Some congressional Democrats have accused Thomas and Alito, two of the court’s most conservative justices, of ethical lapses. Activists criticized Thomas following reports that he failed to disclose accepting travel and lodging from a wealthy benefactor and that his wife was involved in efforts to overturn Trump’s 2020 election loss. Thomas has said that he regarded the travel he accepted as personal hospitality not subject to disclosure requirements. Alito similarly faced criticism after the revelation that flags associated with Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 results were flown outside the justice’s homes in Virginia and New Jersey. Alito has said it was his wife, not him, who flew the flags.",

                    "text": "Two years since the last episode of The Ellen Show aired, Ellen DeGeneres has announced she is ready to swim away from Hollywood. The 66-year-old recently revealed the news on Monday, July 8, during her “Ellen’s Last Stand…Up” tour that took place in Santa Rosa. During a Q&A session, a fan asked the Finding Dory actress if she had any future projects they can expect to see, per SFGATE she immediately responded with “Um, no… This is the last time you’re going to see me. After my Netflix special, I’m done.” She continued, “Thank you for still caring!” She became a household name in Hollywood not only for personality on-camera with her succesful talk show, but also for starring in films such as Finding Nemo, Mr.Wrong. Her show first aired in people’s homes back in 2003 and came to an end in 2022 due to Ellen’s behavior on set. Many former employees that once worked with the defamed talk show host told Buzzfeed that it was a “negative environment” and all that they would show on screen was “just an act.” Executive producers Andy Lassner, Ed Galvin, and Mary Connelly stated to the outlet, “Over the course of nearly two decades, 3,000 episodes, and employing over 1000 staff members, we have strived to create an open, safe, and inclusive work environment…We are truly heartbroken and sorry to learn that even one person in our production family has had a negative experience. It’s not who we are and not who we strive to be, and not the mission Ellen has set for us…For the record, the day to day responsibility of the Ellen show is completely on us. We take all of this very seriously and we realize, as many in the world are learning, that we need to do better, are committed to do better, and we will do better.” The comedian even joked during her tour performance, “Oh yeah, and I got kicked out of show business for being mean.” She backed herself up later by expressing, “I am many things, but I am not mean.”",

                    "text": "DeGeneres said as much during a Q&A with the audience after a recent show at the Luther Burbank Center for Arts in Santa Rosa, California. One audience member asked if DeGeneres was considering a grander return after her tour, potentially returning to movies or Broadway. DeGeneres answered succinctly: “Um, no,” she said. “This is the last time you’re going to see me. After my Netflix special, I’m done.” When another fan asked if she would consider returning to voice work, reprising her role as Dory in a Finding Nemo or Finding Dory sequel, she also shot that down. “No. I’m going bye-bye, remember?” DeGeneres said. But before that, DeGeneres wants to set the record straight. At previous stops on the tour, she referred to herself as “the most hated woman in America” and made jokes about her exile from Hollywood, saying that she had been “kicked out of show business.” She was referring to how the public’s perception of her soured after a bombshell 2020 BuzzFeed report in which 10 former and one then current staffer at The Ellen DeGeneres Show accused the comedian of fostering a toxic workplace environment. The story included allegations of racism and intimidation. At the time, DeGeneres apologized to her staff and said she was committed to ensuring the issues didn’t reoccur. DeGeneres also delivered an on-air apology, but it was too little too late. The allegations led to a steep decline in viewers, multiple Ellen senior staff members being dismissed, and ultimately hastened the end of DeGeneres’s long-running, Emmy-winning daytime show after 19 seasons. According to Variety, DeGeneres said at the Santa Rosa show that she “can be demanding and impatient and tough.” “I am a strong woman,” she continued. “I am many things, but I am not mean.” DeGeneres recently canceled four dates of her comedy tour in Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Dallas without any explanation. Ellen’s Last Stand…Up tour is scheduled to continue through August 17. Her Netflix stand-up special is set to be taped during the tour and air in late 2024.",

The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner announced on Tuesday, July 9, that the longtime entertainment reporter died from \"ischemic heart disease due to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (lethal heartbeat due to lack of blood and oxygen flowing to the heart).\" Rubin died on May 10 while in a local hospital. Earlier that morning, he was experiencing stomach pain and was advised by his doctor to call 911. He died in an emergency room later that morning. The medical examiner's office confirmed that \"the manner of death is natural.\" The findings were also shared by KTLA, the news station where Rubin worked for over three decades. The outlet was the first to announce his death during a live broadcast and a statement on X, formerly Twitter, on May 10. \"KTLA 5 is profoundly saddened to report the death of Sam Rubin,\" the statement read. \"Sam was a giant in the local news industry and the entertainment world, and a fixture of Los Angeles morning television for decades. His laugh, charm and caring personality touched all who knew him. Sam was a loving husband and father: the roles he cherished the most. Our thoughts are with Sam’s family during this difficult time,\" the statement continued. Rubin's longtime manager, Jamie Gruttemeyer, also confirmed the news in a statement to PEOPLE in May. \"Morning news will never be the same. I think we all feel that losing Sam is like losing a close family friend... Someone who could always lift your spirits, someone who was welcome in your home, and always showed up with a smile on his face. Sam will be forever missed,\" Gruttemeyer said. He is survived by his wife, Leslie, and their four children, including his teenage son, Colby, who shared a touching tribute on-air days after his father's death.

                    "text": "Beloved entertainment journalist Sam Rubin suffered a fatal heart attack following his hospitalization in May, a coroner’s report revealed Tuesday. The 64-year-old Hollywood reporter’s death was determined as “ischemic heart disease due to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease,” the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office announced Tuesday. His death was ruled as natural. Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is described as a lethal heartbeat due to a lack of blood and oxygen flowing to the heart. Ischemic heart disease, also known as Coronoary Heart Disease, is classified as a leading cause of death around the world, according to the National Institutes of Health. About 126 million people are affected by the disease worldwide, with nine million deaths being attributed to it. Men are more commonly affected than women. The longtime KTLA personality had gone to a local hospital the morning of May 10 with stomach pain after calling 911 on the advice of his doctors. He was pronounced dead inside the emergency room at 11:03 a.m. the medical examiner added. An autopsy was performed on May 13, and the full examiner’s report is expected to be released by the end of the week. Rubin, a founding member of the Broadcast Film Critics’ Association, received several accolades during his career. He joined KTLA in 1991 and served as the outlet’s weekday entertainment anchor for over three decades. In 2013 he was honored by the National Hispanic Media Coalition, receiving its annual Impact Award for outstanding integrity in broadcast journalism. Rubin is also a recipient of a Golden Mic award, a lifetime achievement award from the Southern California Broadcasters Association, and was named the best entertainment reporter by the Los Angeles Press Club. Apart from his expansive television career, the San Diego native also wrote two biographies, one covering later former first lady Jackie Onassis and another about actress and activist Mia Farrow, according to KCAL. Rubin’s final show appearance came on May 9, the day before his death, where he talked with actress Jane Seymour, an interview he posted to X. He did not appear on the broadcast on May 10 and “showed no outward signs of illness,” KTLA said citing coworkers. He is survived by his wife, Leslie, and their four children.",

                    "text": "One senior-level official from former President Donald Trump's administration just made an ominous threat to the immigrant community during a recent gathering of far-right political activists. On Tuesday, Semafor reporter Dave Weigel reported that during the National Conservatism conference (also known as \"NatCon\") in Washington, D.C., several of the speakers eagerly expressed how they would help the former president accomplish his goal of pursuing vengeance against his political opponents if elected to a second term. During one panel, Tom Homan – who was director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump's Department of Homeland Security – suggested he was already working behind the scenes to make Trump's promise to deport millions of immigrants as draconian as possible. \"Trump comes back in January, I’ll be on his heels coming back, and I will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen,” Homan said. “They ain’t seen s— yet. Wait until 2025.” READ MORE: This Trump campaign platform will cause 'enormous disruption' and economic chaos: analysis As the New York Times reported last year, one key plank of Trump's second-term policy agenda is the rounding up and detainment of undocumented immigrants on an unprecedented scale. Trump immigration advisor Stephen Miller — an outed white nationalist — previously suggested Trump would deport approximately 10 million immigrants during a second term. Earlier this year, Ronald Brownstein — a senior editor for the Atlantic — tweeted excerpts from a speech Miller gave to National Rifle Association activists about how Trump would create “standing facilities” to detain immigrants by the thousands “where planes are moving off the runway constantly.” Deporting millions of immigrants in a short number of years would likely be a major blow to the economy and result in significant price hikes for Americans. New York Times reporters Maggie Haberman, Charlie Savage and Jonathan Swan reported last month that it's likely \"production falls and labor costs go up\" in the event of mass deportations. \"For example, if farmers could not find enough workers to pick all their crops, there would be a smaller supply of produce and it would get more expensive,\" they wrote. \"And businesses would be forced to offer higher wages to attract or retain workers — passing on some of their higher costs to consumers.\" According to Weigel, the NatCon audience that met at the Capital Hilton in D.C. consisted of \"Trump administration veterans mingled with conservative writers and think tankers who had conquered the old 'Bush-Romney' Republican Party.\" Attendees reportedly viewed Trump as \"a conquering hero who’d have a confident, well-trained movement behind him next year,\" and NatCon speakers often echoed Trump's promises to use the force of the federal government to punish Trump's enemies. READ MORE: Trump will 'reignite' inflation with 'fiscally irresponsible' policy: Nobel economists In a segment featuring former Trump attorney John Eastman (author of the so-called \"Eastman Memo\" that outlined the plot to disrupt Congress' certification of the 2020 Electoral College count), the now-disbarred lawyer proposed punishing federal judges who ruled against Trump in his unsuccessful election litigation. \"We’ve got to start impeaching these judges for acting in such an unbelievably partisan way from the bench,\" Eastman said, just a week after the six conservatives on the Supreme Court ruled that presidents are free to break the law as long as it's deemed an official act. John Yoo, who was a top DOJ official in former George W. Bush's administration, also encouraged political reprisal under a second Trump administration. He specifically called on Republican prosecutors to be Trump's political foot soldiers should he win in November. \"People who have used this tool against people like John [Eastman] or President Trump have to be prosecuted by Republican or conservative DAs in exactly the same way, for exactly the same kinds of things, until they stop,\" Yoo said.

                    "text": "MUNICH -- Kylian Mbappé conceded his Euro 2024 campaign had been a failure after France were eliminated on Tuesday, losing 2-1 in the semifinal to Spain at the Allianz Arena. Mbappé set up Randal Kolo Muani to give France an early lead in Munich, but Spain responded through strikes from Lamine Yamal and Dani Olmo to set up a final against either England or the Netherlands in Berlin on Sunday. The Real Madrid forward's tournament ended with just one goal, a penalty against Poland in the group phase, in five appearances. \"My competition? It was difficult,\" Mbappé told reporters. \"It was a failure. We had the ambition to be European champions; I had the ambition to be European champion. We aren't that, so it's a failure. \"It's football. We have to move on. It's been a long year. I'm going to go on holiday and get some rest -- that'll do me a lot of good, and I'll try and come back strongly.\" Mbappé's tournament began in the worst possible way when he broke his nose in France's opening game against Austria. That forced him to miss the stalemate with the Netherlands, but he returned wearing a mask against Poland, Belgium and Portugal, although due to feeling uncomfortable with the face wear, he ditched it against Spain. \"Wearing a mask was not easy for him, it restricted his vision and was an inconvenience,\" France coach Didier Deschamps explained in a news conference after the loss. \"There was a medical consultation with the staff and Kylian felt more at ease without the mask.\" Without Mbappé on song, France struggled to fire at Euro 2024. Kolo Muani's opener against Spain was the first goal scored by a French player from open play at the tournament after two own goals and a penalty. As well as Mbappé, Antoine Griezmann has also been criticised, with the Atlético Madrid forward dropped from the starting lineup against Spain. \"I am not going to pass on the responsibility, I am in charge and I am responsible,\" Deschamps said when asked about the performances of Mbappé and Griezmann. \"We were facing a Spain side with such quality. Even though Antoine didn't start, Kylian did and we tried to do our best with what we had. And we tried to be as efficient as possible. \"It was great because we took the lead, but this Spanish side masters the game so well. We didn't perform so well in the end. We didn't manage to play as vertically as I would have wished. \"We did push until the end. I will not say that my players did not give their all. But they did not all play at 100% of their capacity in this Euros for several reasons.\" Deschamps, who took over France in 2012 and has taken them to two World Cup finals -- winning one -- and a European Championship final, has two years to run on his contract and is expected to lead Les Bleus into the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Olivier Giroud, though, has seemingly played his last match for his country, having previously declared his intention to retire from international football following the Euros. The striker, who left AC Milan for Los Angeles FC earlier this summer, came on for the final minutes against Spain but was unable to add to his impressive tally of 57 goals in 137 appearances. \"He is disappointed like all the players,\" Deschamps said of Giroud, who will turn 38 in September and made his international debut in 2011. \"Olivier was here from the beginning [of my time] and he's the last one from first match we had. There have been some difficult periods, periods where he has not been as efficient. But he is an example of longevity, seriousness and professionalism. \"He has had less playing time this Euros compared to initial discussions, but he is a leader in this group even if he is not always on pitch. It would have been better to finish on Sunday, but we want to say to him well done and thank you.\"",

                    "text": "Les Bleus are feeling blue after their Euro 2024 performance. France captain Kylian Mbappé expressed strong disappointment in his team’s tournament stint, following their semifinal elimination to Spain in Munich on Tuesday. “My competition? It was difficult,” Mbappé told reporters, per ESPN. “It was a failure. We had the ambition to be European champions; I had the ambition to be European champion. We aren’t that, so it’s a failure.” Randal Kolo Muani headed in a cross from Mbappé within the first 10 minutes of the match to give France an early lead over Spain on Tuesday. However, Spain responded quickly with goals from young superstar Lamine Yamal, 16, and Dani Olmo, taking a lead in the 25th minute they would never relinquish. Mbappe, who helped France win the 2018 World Cup, was expected to lead his country to their fourth European Championship final in Germany. However, he recorded just one goal — a penalty against Poland — and two assists, including Tuesday’s to Muani, in Euro 2024. The tournament started poorly for the Real Madrid forward, who broke his nose in France’s opening match against Austria and missed the following game against the Netherlands. Refusing surgery that would end his tournament, he returned with a mask. Mbappé had complained the mask hindered him and ditched it in the semifinal after he got hit in the same area. “Wearing a mask was not easy for him, it restricted his vision and was an inconvenience,” France coach Didier Deschamps said in a conference following the loss. “There was a medical consultation with the staff and Kylian felt more at ease without the mask.” Deschamps became the coach in 2012, taking France to a World Cup championship in 2018 and a European Championship final in 2016. “I am not going to pass on the responsibility, I am in charge and I am responsible,” Deschamps said. “It was great because we took the lead, but this Spanish side masters the game so well. We didn’t perform so well in the end. We didn’t manage to play as vertically as I would have wished. “We did push until the end. I will not say that my players did not give their all. But they did not all play at 100 percent of their capacity in this Euros for several reasons.” French forward Antoine Griezmann, who was a key member of the 2018 World Cup Championship team alongside Mbappé, has also faced criticism regarding his Euro 2024 performance. Deschamps removed the 33-year-old, who failed to find the back of the net throughout the tournament, from the starting lineup ahead of the critical semifinal match. Midfielder Adrien Rabiot, who was sidelined for the quarterfinal against Portugal through suspension, had critical words on his teammate’s performance, according to The Athletic. “I don’t know how to explain it, maybe he is less physically fit. We expect a lot more from Antoine because he is capable of doing a lot more,” Rabiot said. “We can win without Antoine, we have a high-level team. But obviously it would be easier if we had Greizmann and Kylian Mbappe at the top of their game.” Mbappe now will move onto his debut with Real Madrid — the 36-time La Liga champs and 15-time UEFA Champions League titleholders — against Real Mallorca on the weekend of Aug. 18 to tip off the season. “It’s football. We have to move on,” Mbappe said. “It’s been a long year. I’m going to go on holiday and get some rest — that’ll do me a lot of good, and I’ll try and come back strongly.”",

The move is the latest in a brewing trade war between the two economic giants. The investigation will focus on wind power, photovoltaics, security equipment and electric trains, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said. The EU has used a new regulation to investigate companies bidding for projects within the European Union. These include a probe into whether Chinese subsidies give wind turbine companies an unfair advantage in the competition for projects in Spain, Greece, France, Romania and Bulgaria. China accused the European Union of protectionism and “reckless distortion” of the definition of subsidies in response to that investigation. The EU has also investigated Chinese companies bidding for a 455-megawatt solar park in Romania and for the procurement of 20 electric trains in Bulgaria. The Chinese investigation will be completed before Jan. 10, with a possible extension of three months to April. It was requested by China’s Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products. The EU imposed provisional tariffs on China-made electric vehicles last week over subsidies that it alleges gives an unfair advantage to automakers exporting from China. In response, China has launched an investigation into European pork exports. Both the EU and the United States are worried that inexpensive Chinese automobiles could overwhelm their domestic producers and lead to factory layoffs. Chinese auto exports have risen about 30% in the first six months of this year.",

                    "title": "'Sunny' review: Rashida Jones is powerful in this dark comic mystery",
                    "text": "In \"Sunny,\" premiering Wednesday on Apple TV+, Rashida Jones plays Suzie Sakamoto, an American living in a near-future Kyoto who has apparently lost her Japanese husband and 8-year-old son in the crash of a commercial airliner — although the possibility that things might be otherwise is raised early in the season. As in most mysteries, much is not as it seems. Grieving and refusing to publicly grieve, Suzie finds herself the unwilling recipient of Sunny (Joanna Sotomura) an Apple-white domestic robot whose adorable, Sanrio-style expressions display on a video screen. This is, she's told, supposed to make her feel less lonely. (\"I'm a hugger,\" says Sunny, much to Suzie's horror. \"Bring it in.\") She has no actual friends. It's at this point that Suzie learns that Masa (Hidetoshi Nishijima, \"Drive My Car\"), her husband, was not a refrigerator engineer, as she believed across their decade-long relationship, but was an important person in cutting-edge robotics; he had personally programmed Sunny for Suzie out of, I can only suppose, some prescient apprehension of his eventual absence. Nothing else makes sense, anyway. (I'm going to call Sunny \"she,\" because the robot reads as female — in Colin O'Sullivan's original novel, \"The Dark Manual,\" since re-titled to match the series, it's called Sonny — and because all the other main characters, including the primary antagonist, are women. It's their world we're in, not accidentally.) Her initial attempts to divest herself of Sunny entwine with her desire to learn just who her husband was; there will be skulking and unpleasant if incomplete discoveries. Drowning her sorrows in the bar where she and Masa were regulars, Suzie meets lively, motley haired Mixxy (Annie the Clumsy), a new bartender, who tells her of the Dark Manual, an illegal underground guide to homebot hacking that might allow her to turn Suzie completely off rather than just unreliably put her to sleep. It has apparently less benign applications, as well, and every step leads her further into the coils of an overly complicated plot; dangerous situations follow upon dangerous situations, with Suzie and Sunny operating as bickering, bantering buddy cops and Mixxy tagging along out of interest — or is it self-interest? We also see early on that Suzie is under surveillance — by whom? For what? Yakuza are eventually knitted into the story, which is, frankly, a bit of a disappointment; even exotic organized crime is, ultimately, mundane. It's easy to resist Sunny at first, because Suzie does, and especially as it's impossible to tell whether she might cause her owner harm. There is a suggestion in the series' opening that homebots can go dangerously haywire, and Suzie remains suspicious of Sunny even as she comes slowly to accept and rely on her. But one warms to the robot eventually and, indeed, my main concern through the season was whether it would treat her well. Like animals, in a drama or social media video, sentient machines excite our sympathies. As soon as you give a robot a face or a voice, or even a vocabulary of beeps, clicks and whirs, they become indistinguishable emotionally from human characters, no matter how many times someone will assert, \"It's just a machine.\" If anything, they're more sympathetic for not being us. Astro Boy. Data. C-3P0. Replicants. The death of HAL 9000 is the one heartbreaking moment in \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" With her big eyes and soft voice, her attitudes of hope and worry, her capacity to dream and to get \"drunk\" on visual feedback loops, Sunny is as much a protagonist as Suzie. (The series is named for her, after all.) Among a smorgasbord of secrets, it's suggested that Suzie also is hiding something — she won't answer when Masa, in a long flashback to their meeting, asks her \"the real reason\" she moved to Japan. Her desire to disappear introduces the real-world concept of hikikomori, an extreme form of social avoidance in which people sequester in their room, sometimes for years — Masa having been one. (\"It's not a meditation retreat,\" he says, when Suzie expresses interest. \"When people looked at me, it hurt.\") Some plot points feel mechanical, like a Rube Goldberg gadget where the interaction of a boiling tea kettle, a bursting balloon, a scared cat and a falling bowling ball are all required in order to, say, ring a bell — when the logical thing is just to take a stick and strike it; there is a lot of extra energy expended in getting from A to B — I won't say \"wasted,\" but there's a degree of nonsense you'll need to accept. The series, created by Katie Robbins, is much more successful when it concentrates on personal relationships — I'm including Sunny here, obviously — than on the mystery and conspiracy elements, which are no more compelling or even the point of the journey than a villain's plans in your average Bond movie. Human mysteries are always more interesting. The prickly relationship between Suzie and her prickly, passive-aggressive mother-in-law, Noriko (actor, singer, woodcut artist Judy Ongg, quite wonderful) is intentionally frustrating and beautifully played. There are detours in the home stretch, which leads to a twist or a cliffhanger, depending on whether a second season is coming. (There certainly seems more to discuss.) An antepenultimate episode — following the now-common strategy among streaming serials of backing up into the past before finishing in the present — gives Nishijima's Masa a welcome wealth of screen time; the episode that follows goes, surreally, inside Sunny's head, for more backstory and context, while Jones remains almost entirely offscreen. Wayward plotting aside, it's easy to watch — very nicely made, handsomely designed and photographed, with colorful minor characters and striking performances by the major ones. Best known for \"The Office,\" \"Parks and Recreation\" and \"Angie Tribeca,\" Jones — though she spends much of the time depressed — is powerful even in her inwardness. There's not a lot of vanity in her performance and less comedy than usual. (The series has a certain comic lightness, from the bright Saul Bass-style opening credits onward, but it is rarely funny.) Finally, she'll become a sort of slow-moving action hero — think of Doris Day in the climax of \"The Man Who Knew Too Much.\" The creators may have.",

                    "text": "For decades, artificial intelligence served a lot of narrative purposes: a symbol of humanity’s hubris; a metaphor for God, childhood, or otherness; a cautionary tale that industry chose to ignore. Now that AI is upon us (or, rather, a crappy version of AI that doesn’t work but does threaten everyone’s livelihoods, our electrical infrastructure, and the fight against climate change), it’s beginning to feel clumsy to use it as a device to discuss other issues rather than as an issue in itself. Sunny, the new offbeat sci-fi mystery on Apple TV+, doesn’t ask any big questions about AI, nor does it pretend to. It’s a story about isolation, connection, and trauma which happens to explore those topics in part via a cute robot. Sunny has an intriguing premise, a quirky sense of humor, and the occasional profound emotional moment, but compared to something like the underrated Mrs. Davis, which offers all of the above plus an innovative exploration of humanity’s relationship with machines, Sunny doesn’t quite shine. Suzie Sakamoto (Rashida Jones) is a misanthropic American expatriate living in a near-future Kyoto with her husband Masa (Hidetoshi Nishijima), her young son Zen (Fares Belkheir), and no friends whatsoever. Suzie is acerbic and anhedonic, having burned all of her bridges in the States and made no effort to build new ones in Japan. When Masa and Zen are lost in a plane crash, she’s left with no one for company but Masa’s disapproving mother, Noriko (Judy Ong). That is, until she receives an unexpected gift from her late husband: a chipper domestic robot named Sunny (voiced by Joanna Sotomura) who Masa programmed specifically for her. Sunny becomes the key to unlocking not only Masa’s secret life as a genius roboticist but a Yakuza conspiracy. Sunny is a light comic mystery that orbits some very heavy subject matter. The story begins with an already deeply depressed and isolated woman mourning her child, a challenging starting point for a TV comedy. Suzie is accustomed to compartmentalizing or masking her feelings behind sarcasm and rudeness, and her issues are compounded by her cultural outsiderdom, and her mother-in-law’s accusations that she is not “grieving correctly.” It’s a grim scenario, but introducing Suzie via unthinkably tragic circumstances might be the only way to convince an audience to empathize with her. She is simply the worst, and it’s impressive that Rashida Jones was able to smother her own innate charisma so completely. The Homebot is committed to lightening the mood, both for Suzie and the audience, as her personality has been custom-built to complement Suzie’s sardonic deflection. However, Sunny adapts to her human host. Is it only a matter of time before Sunny becomes as sour as the woman she’s supposed to cheer up? Do hurt people hurt robots, and do those hurt robots hurt people? Sunny is a fairly successful non-human character, brought to life practically via real robotics and puppetry, Joanna Sotomura’s vocal performance, and a simple but expressive cartoon face. She’s a fantasy of artificial life as well as a useful mirror to Suzie’s character development. Her appeal as a product is undeniable, even to Suzie, who is even less fond of robots than she is of people. The ethics of manufacturing and presumably selling these sentient beings is never questioned, only the ethics of jailbreaking the robots’ software to circumvent blocks against violent or sexual behavior. Impossibly, the invention of a robotic labor class has had no noticeable impact on the labor market in future Japan. (This entirely uncritical depiction of the AI-driven future was produced by A24 but is distributed by Apple, who would sell you a Sunny tomorrow if they could.) Sunny isn’t Suzie’s only companion in her investigation of the criminal underworld in which her mild-mannered husband was apparently involved. She also makes fast friends with an upbeat and flirtatious bartender, Mixxy (annie the clumsy). Mixxy treads dangerously close to the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope, a cute and sexually available character with practically no life of her own who quickly devotes herself to Suzie’s cause. But, as we come to understand over the course of the season, the only way to get close to Suzie is to make her your project. The rest of the regular cast is no less heightened but certainly more textured. Judy Ongg plays Suzie’s passive-aggressive mother-in-law Noriko, who has an inner life that Suzie has never bothered to consider. Mononynous Japanese actor You shines as Hime, an ambitious female Yakuza underboss who’s the sort of cool antagonist that half of you half want to root for. And then there’s Hidetoshi Nishijima as Masa, a role that’s only a short walk from his quietly haunted Yūsuke in Drive My Car. Masa’s flashback appearances are pinhole views into the life of a nearly unknowable man. He’s a great absent character, and the resolution to his story is ultimately satisfying. Whether or not viewers will have the patience to reach this resolution is another matter. Like so much serialized television, Sunny sags in the middle of its ten-episode season. The weaker chapters may not provide enough incentive to get viewers to the big finale — or, for that matter, motivate them to watch a second season. Even though this first season leaves a lot of meat on the bone and closes on a note that suggests the story is not over, I wouldn’t go out of my way to watch it if and when it returns.",

Polly Pocket In conversation with the New Yorker, Lena Dunham confirmed she’s no longer attached to the Polly Pocket movie for Mattel. I’m not going to make the Polly Pocket movie. I wrote a script, and I was working on it for three years. But I remember someone once said to me about Nancy Meyers: the thing that’s the most amazing about her is that the movie she makes or the movie she would be making with or without a studio, with or without notes — that somehow her taste manages to intersect perfectly with what the world wants. What a f-cking gift that is. And Nora Ephron, too, who was such a mentor to me, but always said, ‘Go be weird. Don’t kowtow to anyone.'” I think Greta [Gerwig] managed this incredible feat [with Barbie], which was to make this thing that was literally candy to so many different kinds of people and was perfectly and divinely Greta. And I just — I felt like, unless I can do it that way, I’m not going to do it. I don’t think I have that in me. I feel like the next movie I make needs to feel like a movie that I absolutely have to make. No one but me could make it. And I did think other people could make Polly Pocket. Possession According to THR, Paramount is only now just “closing a deal” with Robert Pattinson to star in a remake of Andrzej Zulawski’s Possession from director Parker Finn. Crumble Variety reports Laika studios, Phil Lord and Chris Miller are attached to produce Crumble, an original live-action project based on a script by Brian Duffield. The story is only said to concern “a married couple who embark on a world-traveling adventure to find a cure for an ancient curse.” Send Help Deadline reports Sam Raimi is also”closing a deal” to produce and direct Send Help — a “two-hander horror thriller set on an island” — at 20th Century Studios. According to the outlet, the story “is said to “fall somewhere between Misery and Robert Zemeckis’ Castaway.” Shawn Levy’s Star Wars According to the latest edition of the InSneider newsletter, Shawn Levy will reunite with screenwriter Jonathan Tropper (The Adam Project) on his new Star Wars movie at LucasFilm.

                    "text": "Shawn Levy‘s Star Wars movie is picking up some momentum. Lucasfilm has hired screenwriter Jonathan Tropper to pen the script for the feature, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed. The movie first came to light in November 2022, but has been on the backburner while Levy completed work on this month’s Deadpool & Wolverine. Tropper is a frequent Levy collaborator, penning Levy’s 2014 family drama This Is Where I Leave You, and writing the Mark Raso-directed Netflix feature Kodachrome (2017), which Levy produced. The Adam Project was their biggest project to date, with the Ryan Reynolds starrer standing as Netflix’s No. 3 original film of all time. Perhaps appropriately, The Adam Project featured a weapon that resembled a lightsaber. “If there was any doubt about my fanhood of Star Wars and all things a galaxy far, far away, I’ve eliminated that doubt,” Levy told The Hollywood Reporter at the time, though he added that the weapon was not technically a lightsaber due to rights issues. Outside of his work with Levy, Tropper is known for creating the TV shows Banshee and Warrior, and serving as showrunner of the Jason Momoa series See. Levy has a full plate, and it’s unclear if and when this movie would get off the ground. In addition to the final season of Stranger Things, which he produces and directs episodes of, his name has been mentioned in connection with Marvel Studios’ next Avengers movie, though it’s unknown if that will come to fruition. Lucasfilm hasn’t had a Star Wars feature in theaters since 2019’s The Rise of Skywalker and instead has built out its presence as a TV property on Disney+. Jon Favreau is directing the next Star Wars movie, Grogu & The Mandalorian, which moves his Mandalorian TV show characters to the big screen. It is due in theaters May 22, 2026. Tropper is repped by CAA, Kaplan / Perrone Entertainment and Felker Toczek. The Insneider newsletter first reported the news.",

Levy has been attached to the project since 2022. The project would follow after Levy is done with “Deadpool and Wolverine,” which he is currently on a worldwide press tour. Details about the project are being kept under wraps. Tropper and Levy have previously collaborated on Levy’s 2014 family drama “This Is Where I Leave You,” as well as his script for the Mark Raso-directed Netflix film “Kodachrome,” which Levy produced. Their most recent project has been “The Adam Project,” which also starred Reynolds. The sci-fi adventure ranks as Netflix’s third most popular original film ever. Levy is well aware of the number of directors behind him who developed “Star Wars” movies that did not get made. And he’s committed to getting his project across the finish line. Previously, Levy acknowledged the odds against him, but enthusiastically stated his intention to develop a film worth making. “I’ve been talking with Kathy Kennedy for awhile now, and she’s been aware of my passion for this franchise for a long time,” Levy said. “The stars finally aligned, and she came to me and was like, let’s do something here. And that’s as much as I can say. But this is definitely development and not yet close to prep. So there’s a lot of work to be done.” Tropper is repped by CAA, Kaplan / Perrone Entertainment and Felker Toczek. Lucasfilm couldn’t be reached for comment. The Insneider first reported the news.",

According to a video obtained by TMZ, the media personality for ABC News was asked by a passerby while walking in New York City, in workout clothes, on Tuesday, “Do you think Biden should step down? You’ve talked to him more than anybody else has lately.” Stephanopoulos responded, “I don’t think he can serve four more years.” After his comment made headlines, the Good Morning America co-host said in a statement obtained by NBC News, “Earlier today I responded to a question from a passerby. I shouldn’t have.” The Disney-owned news network also added in its own statement, “George expressed his own point of view and not the position of ABC News.” Stephanopoulos’ comment came days after he and ABC News scored the first, exclusive interview with the president following his disastrous debate performance with Donald Trump at the end of June. Throughout the 22-minute, unedited sit-down, which aired on Friday, Stephanopoulos repeatedly hammered Biden with questions on his mental state and whether he is fit for another four years in the White House. The president insisted he just had a “bad night” in response to a question about the debate in Atlanta, adding, “I was exhausted. I didn’t listen to my instincts in terms of preparing.” Since the debate, there have been many calls within Hollywood for Biden to step down as the Democratic presidential nominee, however, he has continuously said he’s staying in the fight for reelection in November. Stephanopoulos is also a former White House communications adviser, working for former President Bill Clinton.",

                    "text": "Officials with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) have warned that Russia has launched a plan to interfere in the 2024 election to bolster the chances of former President Trump being re-elected. In a briefing with reporters on Tuesday, ODNI officials said that Russia is the \"preeminent threat\" to the election and that while China doesn’t plan to influence the outcome of the presidential race, the communist nation is being carefully monitored to see if it mingles in down-ballot races. \"It's all the tactics we've seen before, primarily through social media, efforts using influential U.S. voices to amplify their narratives and other tactics,\" an official said. \"And as far as who they're targeting, what we can say today is, Russia is sophisticated enough to know that, targeting swing state voters is, particularly valuable to them.\" WAPO ADMITS RUSSIAN TROLLS 'HAD LITTLE INFLUENCE ON 2016 VOTERS' AFTER YEARS HYPING THEIR ROLE IN TRUMP'S WIN Officials said that the intelligence community expects Russia will increase its underhanded activities as U.S. election day gets closer in order to manipulate public opinion, underscoring the threat to America’s political landscape. Although former President Trump was not named specifically, ODNI officials said that the Russian interference is mimicking what it says were similar preferences for U.S. presidential candidates seen in previous election cycles. Russia is \"undertaking a whole-of-government approach to influence the election, including the presidential race, Congress and public opinion,\" the official said, noting that Russia has grown \"more sophisticated\" over the years in election interference. The Kremlin, officials said, is seeking to influence specific voting groups in swing states, as well as looking to promote divisive narratives and denigrate specific politicians, although no specifics were provided. An official said that artificial intelligence (A.I.) is making it easier for Russia – and other actors – to interfere in the U.S. political syatem, since the technology allows Kremlin operatives to mimic American Southern or Midwestern accents. 'PRO-RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE NETWORKS' EXIST IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, BELGIAN PM SAYS The Trump campaign and the Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital requests for comment. \"Foreign adversaries continue to experiment with and have adopted at least some generative AI tools to more quickly and cheaply generate authentic looking content tailored primarily for social media platforms that can target specific audiences including in the U.S.,\" an ODNI official said during the briefing, noting a heavy focus on its use by Russia and China. The official added, \"China would be interested in down-ballot races down to the state and potentially local level. But to be clear, this is something we're watching at this time, rather than, actively seeing it as we did in the 2022 cycle. Right now, our assessment is focused that China doesn't perceive a benefit in supporting either candidate, or either party.\" The official said that China is pulling data from TikTok and other social media platforms used in the U.S. in order to spread their influence narratives, as well as to collect publicly available data on users and public opinion. Meanwhile, the ODNI official said that Iran is seeking to stoke social divisions among the U.S. population and \"undermine confidence in the US democratic institutions around the elections.\" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said Tuesday that Iran is attempting through social media to covertly stoke protests in the U.S. against the war in Gaza. \"We have observed actors tied to Iran’s government posing as activists online, seeking to encourage protests, and even providing financial support to protesters,\" Haines said, adding that Americans protesting in good faith may not know they are being influenced by the Iranian regime. \"We urge all Americans to remain vigilant as they engage online with accounts and actors they do not personally know.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Tuesday’s briefing came on the same day that the Justice Department nabbed an alleged social media \"bot farm\" run by the Russian government that was being used to spread disinformation in the U.S. and other countries. The Justice Department said it seized two domain names and identified 968 social media profiles used by Russian actors in the Netherlands to create AI-enhanced social media profiles to promote messages in support of Russian government objectives. One of the fake messages posted on X, formerly Twitter, in 2023 included a video of Russian President Vladimir Putin justifying the country’s actions in Ukraine, although the video only had a handful of views.

                    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum shipped from Mexico that were made elsewhere — an attempt to stop China from avoiding import taxes by routing goods through one of the United States’ closest trading partners. Lael Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council, said the tariffs announced Wednesday will be levied as part of an agreement with Mexico through section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, which applies to imports that could threaten U.S. national security. There will be a 25% tariff on steel not melted or poured in Mexico and a 10% tariff on aluminum. The new taxes on steel are meant to address the evasion of tariffs by China, the dominant producer of more than half of the world’s steel. The aluminum taxes would also hit production based in China, Belarus, Iran and Russia. The move is also a clear political shot at Republican Donald Trump, President Joe Biden’s predecessor and his likely opponent in November’s election. Brainard noted that Trump could have taken similar actions but failed to do so. “The president is taking action to close loopholes left by his predecessor that allowed China to circumvent trade rules,” she said. The financial impact of the tariffs is likely somewhat modest, though, given the volumes of steel and aluminum being routed this way through Mexico. Administration officials said the U.S. imported 3.8 million tons of steel last year from Mexico, with 13% of that having been poured or melted outside that country. Similarly, the U.S. imported 105,000 metric tons of aluminum from Mexico and only 6% was smelted or cast outside that country. Still, the issue could be politically relevant. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, has called for stopping Mexican steel imports, saying that a “surge” from that country is a threat to U.S. steelworkers and a way to evade tariffs. Brown is seeking reelection against Republican Bernie Moreno, a wealthy businessman from Cleveland. Ohio was once a political bellwether, but it has voted for Trump in the previous two presidential elections. Implementation of the new tariffs begins Wednesday with the announcement.",

(AP) — A gunman killed by Yellowstone National Park rangers as he fired a semiautomatic rifle at the entrance of a dining facility with about 200 people inside had told a woman as he held her at gunpoint earlier that he planned to carry out a mass shooting, park officials said Tuesday. Park rangers shot back and killed the man during the attack Thursday morning. Yellowstone officials identified the lone shooter Tuesday as Samson Lucas Bariah Fussner, 28, of Milton, Florida. A park ranger who was wounded was released from a hospital but not identified. The shooting led authorities to close off Canyon Lodge, a complex of hotel rooms, cabins and dining facilities, some of which remained closed Tuesday. Fussner worked for Xanterra Parks and Resorts, the main concessionaire for such facilities in Yellowstone, park officials said in a statement Tuesday. The statement provided several previously unreleased details about what happened. Soon after midnight Thursday, law enforcement rangers heard that Fussner had held a woman against her will with a gun at a residence in Canyon Village, a lodging area near Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone in the park’s northern end. The woman reported that Fussner threatened to kill her and others, including carrying out a mass shooting at July 4 events outside the park. Rangers found Fussner’s vehicle but not him. More than 20 law enforcement rangers, including a park special response team, looked for Fussner while organizing to protect park visitors and employees. Around 8 a.m. Thursday, law enforcement rangers encountered Fussner as he approached and fired on a service entrance to the Canyon Lodge dining facility. Several of the rangers shot at Fussner, and he died at the scene, according to the statement. No other injuries were reported. “Thanks to the heroic actions of our law enforcement rangers, many lives were saved here last Thursday,” Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly said in the statement. The FBI was investigating. Per National Park Service policy, law enforcement rangers involved in a shooting are placed on paid administrative leave while the shooting is investigated, the statement said.

                    "title": "Microsoft and Apple abandon board roles at OpenAI amid increasing regulatory scrutiny",
                    "text": "Microsoft, which invested $13 billion in the ChatGPT creator, will withdraw from the board, the company said in a letter to OpenAI, which was seen by Bloomberg News. Apple was due to take up a similar role, but an OpenAI spokesperson said the startup will have no board observers after Microsoft’s departure. Regulators in Europe and the US had expressed concern about Microsoft’s sway over OpenAI, applying pressure on one of the world’s most valuable companies to show that it’s keeping the relationship at arm’s length. Microsoft has integrated OpenAI’s services into its Windows and Copilot AI platforms and, like other big US tech companies, is banking on the new technology to help drive growth. “Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company’s direction,” Microsoft wrote in the memo. “We no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.” Microsoft is facing broader scrutiny over its alleged dominance of artificial intelligence. The US has started separate investigations into Microsoft’s alleged dominance of the rapidly emerging field, and whether the company properly notified antitrust agencies about its deal with an OpenAI rival, Inflection AI, people familiar with the matter have said. European regulators also said they were going to survey Microsoft’s rivals about OpenAI’s exclusive use of its technology, and the UK’s competition regulator is weighing a deeper investigation of the tie up. Microsoft isn’t being singled out. The UK is also looking into Amazon.com Inc.’s $4 billion collaboration with AI company Anthropic, expressing concern that large tech companies are using partnerships to “shield themselves from competition.” The US is probing Nvidia Corp.’s dominance over AI chips. The Financial Times reported Microsoft’s exit earlier. The biggest US tech companies including Microsoft as well as Nvidia, Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com have poured tens of billions of dollars into AI businesses. While these investments and partnerships are a lifeline for the startups, regulators have expressed concern that they threaten to concentrate access to the most innovative large language models among the tech companies that already dominate other platforms. Tech giants are also striking non-financial agreements. These include Apple’s partnership with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to the iPhone, and Microsoft’s decision earlier this year to bring on Inflection AI’s Mustafa Suleyman and most of his staff from the OpenAI rival. Microsoft took on the non-voting observer role on OpenAI’s board last year, weeks after the startup’s directors had fired Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman in a dramatic coup over the direction of the company. Altman was quickly reinstated following a backlash from employees and the board was remade. “We’re grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership,” OpenAI said in a statement to Bloomberg News, without commenting directly on Apple or Microsoft’s decisions. OpenAI said that moving forward, the company will host regular stakeholder meetings with partners and investors, including Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, “to share progress on our mission and ensure stronger collaboration across safety and security.” OpenAI began in 2015 as a nonprofit research organization, but later shifted its structure to include a for-profit startup that has solicited investments and struck commercial partnerships.",

                    "text": "CENTRAL ISLIP, N.Y. (AP) — A leader of an MS-13 gang clique in New York pleaded guilty Wednesday to racketeering and firearms charges in a case involving eight murders, including the 2016 killings of two high school girls who were hacked and beaten to death as they strolled through their leafy, suburban neighborhood on Long Island. Alexi Saenz entered the plea Wednesday in federal court in Central Islip. Prosecutors previously withdrew an attempt to seek the death penalty in his case. Among the deaths he was accused of ordering are the killings of Kayla Cuevas, 16, and Nisa Mickens, 15, lifelong friends and classmates at Brentwood High School who were killed with a machete and a baseball bat. The deaths of the high school students focused the nation’s attention on MS-13 gang violence during the administration of President Donald Trump. The Republican called for the death penalty for Saenz and others arrested in the killings and blamed the violence and gang growth on lax immigration policies as he made several visits to Long Island. Cuevas’ mother Evelyn Rodriguez was a guest at Trump’s 2018 State of the Union address. The girls’ deaths led to questions about whether police had been aggressive enough in confronting what was then a serious threat of gangs developing inside area high schools. For months in 2016, Hispanic children and young men had been disappearing in Brentwood, a working class community 40 miles (64.37 kilometers) east of New York City. After Cuevas and Mickens were killed, police discovered the bodies of three other young people in Brentwood, ages 15, 18 and 19, who had vanished months earlier. Police and federal agents arrested dozens of suspected members of MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, a transnational criminal organization believed to have been founded as a neighborhood street gang in Los Angeles in the mid-1980s by people fleeing civil war in El Salvador. Cuevas’ mother, Rodriguez, became an anti-gang activist after her daughter’s death but was herself killed in 2018. Rodriguez was fatally struck by a car during a dispute over a memorial marking the second anniversary of her daughter’s death. The driver, Annmarie Drago, pleaded guilty in 2024 to negligent homicide. Saenz’s lawyers didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment Wednesday. Prosecutors said Saenz, also known as “Blasty” and “Big Homie,” was the leader of an MS-13 clique operating in Brentwood and Central Islip known as Sailors Locos Salvatruchas Westside. Charges are still pending against his brother, Jairo Saenz, who prosecutors say was second-in-command in the local gang. ___ Follow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.",

                    "title": "What cognitive tests can show — and what they can't",
                    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — It’s the new chant in Washington politics: “Get a cognitive test!” Political opponents, armchair pundits and even nervous supporters are demanding that President Joe Biden undergo such testing after his dismal debate performance – even though his physician says he gets, and passes, an annual neurologic exam. Former President Donald Trump, who’s only a few years younger, makes his own gaffes. He recently bragged about passing a 2018 cognitive test – while calling the doctor who administered it by the wrong name. With all the concern, what can cognitive testing actually tell about a person’s brain health – and what can’t they answer? And presidents aside, does the average older adult need one? What are cognitive tests? They’re brief screening tools, a 10-minute series of questions to assess different brain functions. Two of the most common are called the MMSE, Mini-Mental State Exam, and the MoCA, Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Recalling a list of five unrelated nouns or seeing how many words beginning with F you can say in a minute can assess short-term memory and language. Counting backward by 7s tests attention and concentration. Drawing a clock with the correct time is a clue to spatial awareness. How reliable are cognitive screenings? They don’t diagnose health problems. A bad score is just a red flag that indicates a need for further testing to see if there is a health problem and uncover what kind, said Dr. James Galvin, a neurologist at the University of Miami. A good score usually is good news. But the highly educated especially tend to be good test-takers even if cognitive trouble is starting to brew. So if someone scores OK yet they, a family member or the doctor sees some day-to-day concern, more testing still could be warranted. “We simply use it as a benchmark to determine our suspicion level,” Galvin said. When and how often should cognitive screenings be done? “A screening test is exactly a snapshot in time. So it tells you in that moment how someone does on that test,” Galvin stressed. “It doesn’t tell you how a person is functioning in their everyday life.” Simply reporting a concern is reason enough for a primary care doctor to perform one. But it’s also supposed to be part of the annual Medicare wellness visit for those 65 and older. Galvin wouldn’t discuss Biden or Trump because he hasn’t examined them — but said that generally it’s a good idea for seniors to get checked yearly to spot changes. It’s much like how doctors don’t assume your blood pressure’s still fine, they measure it. How is a cognitive test different from a neurologic exam? Cognitive screenings are “pencil and paper tests” usually handled by primary care doctors, while neurologic exams generally are performed by a specialist, Galvin said. It’s a very detailed physical exam. Doctors watch the patient’s speech patterns and behavior, test how key nerves are functioning, check reflexes that can signal brain diseases and assess muscle tone and function. If either kind of test signals real cognitive concerns, the next step may be more intensive neuropsychological testing — an exam that often lasts up to three hours. After an exhaustive interview of the patient and any accompanying family members, the neuropsychologist goes through tests and tasks designed to check specific brain functions – intelligence, memory, verbal ability, problem-solving and reasoning skills, visual and auditory responses, emotion and mood. They may use puzzles, objects to rearrange, or drawing and writing tests. Blood tests and brain scans also may be ordered. Special types of PET scans can detect Alzheimer’s hallmark amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain. An MRI can detect past strokes, helpful in diagnosing vascular dementia. How can you tell if cognitive concerns are a disease or just getting older? “Age makes us do things a lot slower,” Galvin said. “We move slower. We think slower. But we’re still moving correctly and we’re still thinking correctly – it just takes us longer.” Examples of slower cognitive “processing” might be difficulty remembering a name, numbers or specific details under pressure – but they come back to you later. Galvin noted that sometimes, reversible health problems mimic cognitive trouble. For example, urinary tract infections are notorious for causing sudden confusion in older people. Certain medications affect memory, as can thyroid problems, depression, even poorly controlled diabetes. Anyone who’s worried about their memory should talk to their doctor, or seek a specialist, “who can reassure you that everything’s OK or develop a treatment plan that’s specific for you,” he said. —- The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

                    "text": "WASHINGTON -- It's the new chant in Washington politics: \"Get a cognitive test!\" Political opponents, armchair pundits and even nervous supporters are demanding that President Joe Biden undergo such testing after his dismal debate performance - even though his physician says he gets, and passes, an annual neurologic exam. Former President Donald Trump, who's only a few years younger, makes his own gaffes. He recently bragged about passing a 2018 cognitive test - while calling the doctor who administered it by the wrong name. With all the concern, what can cognitive testing actually tell about a person's brain health - and what can't they answer? And presidents aside, does the average older adult need one? What are cognitive tests? They're brief screening tools, a 10-minute series of questions to assess different brain functions. Two of the most common are called the MMSE, Mini-Mental State Exam, and the MoCA, Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Recalling a list of five unrelated nouns or seeing how many words beginning with F you can say in a minute can assess short-term memory and language. Counting backward by 7s tests attention and concentration. Drawing a clock with the correct time is a clue to spatial awareness. How reliable are cognitive screenings? They don't diagnose health problems. A bad score is just a red flag that indicates a need for further testing to see if there is a health problem and uncover what kind, said Dr. James Galvin, a neurologist at the University of Miami. A good score usually is good news. But the highly educated especially tend to be good test-takers even if cognitive trouble is starting to brew. So if someone scores OK yet they, a family member or the doctor sees some day-to-day concern, more testing still could be warranted. \"We simply use it as a benchmark to determine our suspicion level,\" Galvin said. When and how often should cognitive screenings be done? \"A screening test is exactly a snapshot in time. So it tells you in that moment how someone does on that test,\" Galvin stressed. \"It doesn't tell you how a person is functioning in their everyday life.\" Simply reporting a concern is reason enough for a primary care doctor to perform one. But it's also supposed to be part of the annual Medicare wellness visit for those 65 and older. Galvin wouldn't discuss Biden or Trump because he hasn't examined them - but said that generally it's a good idea for seniors to get checked yearly to spot changes. It's much like how doctors don't assume your blood pressure's still fine, they measure it. How is a cognitive test different from a neurologic exam? Cognitive screenings are \"pencil and paper tests\" usually handled by primary care doctors, while neurologic exams generally are performed by a specialist, Galvin said. It's a very detailed physical exam. Doctors watch the patient's speech patterns and behavior, test how key nerves are functioning, check reflexes that can signal brain diseases and assess muscle tone and function.

First reported by TechCrunch, the same features will be shown when users start using navigation on Google Maps on their iPhones. Users can now turn on the speed limit indicators, by going into the Google Maps app and finding Settings, heading to Navigation and selecting \"Driving options.\" If the feature is enabled, the speed indicator will change colors to nudge drivers to stay within speed limits within their designated region.

That same capability is finally coming to Google Maps for the iPhone. The speedometer and speed limit display is now rolling out to iPhone users around the world, Google told TechCrunch on Tuesday. TechCrunch said that it already saw the new feature pop up in Google Maps in India early last week. Also: 12 iPhone apps that I can't live without (and why you need them, too) Once you start using the latest version of Google Maps for iOS to head to your destination, your car's speed and the speed limit will appear in miles or kilometers depending on your current region. The speed limit indicator even changes colors to tell you whether or not you're driving within the posted speed limit. The new display is available with Google Maps for iOS version 6.123.0, according to 9to5Google, which jibes with the latest version on my iPhone. However, the server-side update for the feature has been rolling out to iOS users over the past few weeks. The capability should serve as a useful indicator for any iPhone owner behind the wheel. Your eyes sometimes naturally check the iPhone or CarPlay screen for visual help as you drive. Seeing both your own speed and the speed limit on the screen can help you stay within the limit and avoid a hefty fine and ticket. Still, a Google Maps support page cautions you that the speedometer shown in the app is for informational purposes only. Google advises drivers to check their car's actual speedometer to confirm their driving speed. Also: Worried about dementia? Here's why I'm ditching GPS for a road atlas The speedometer and speed limit display has been available in Google Maps for Android users for the past five years. iPhone owners who use CarPlay have also long be able to see the current speed and speed limit. To turn on the speedometer and speed limits, according to TechCrunch, open Google Maps on your iPhone and tap your profile icon. Go to Settings, select Navigation, and then select Driving options. I didn't see that setting on my iPhone; however, I did find another way to control the speedometer. Make sure you're at the Navigation screen in Google Maps. Swipe down to the Map display section. The fourth option says \"Show speedometer,\" which you can turn on and off. I tried out the new display on a drive, and both the speedometer and speed limit appeared on the iPhone and my CarPlay screen. Though I typically use Apple Maps when navigating, this may provide a bit more incentive to use Google Maps the next time I take my car for a ride.",

The feature is already available for some users. To reach it: Open Google Maps on the iPhone.Tap on your account icon on the top right of the screen.Select Settings > Navigation > Map display.Scroll until you see \"Show speedometer,\" then tap the switch next to the option so it's in the \"on\" position. TechCrunch, which earlier reported the addition and its planned rollout over the next couple of weeks, said the speedometer will change color to nudge you to drive within speed limits. Google representatives didn't respond to a request for further comment. The company does warn users on its website that the free speedometer feature is for \"informational use only,\" and that they should rely on their vehicle's built-in speedometer to confirm their \"actual driving speed.\" Google's decision to add a speedometer with speed-limit warnings to iPhones and CarPlay is the company's latest bid to potentially shift people to Google Maps from the company's other mapping app, Waze. Google Maps also competes against Apple's Maps app, which is built into iPhones by default. Google added a speedometer and speed limits feature to Android in 2019, offering users ways to more easily follow speed limits and alert one another of speed camera traps along their route. That same year, Google added the speed-trap feature to Google Maps for iPhone, as well as ways to see and report six other hazards and slowdowns. Waze, another routing app Google acquired in 2013 for roughly $1 billion, is particularly popular among drivers for its detailed traffic reports, speedometer and other warnings. Google has kept the app running over the past decade, despite overlap between Google Maps and Waze, suggesting it still has a sizable following.",

                    "text": "The Jennifers are sticking together. Jennifer Garner has been an “unexpected ally” for Jennifer Lopez as the latter’s divorce from Ben Affleck looms, according to a new report. The actresses have been “really friendly” and are “relating to each other” during Lopez’s marital woes, Us Weekly reported Tuesday. “[Garner] has been helpful to J.Lo,” a source claimed to the magazine, calling the “13 Going on 30” star, 52, a “surprising person for” Lopez, 54, to talk to. Page Six has reached out to reps for Lopez and Garner for comment. The “Let’s Get Loud” singer married Affleck, 51, in Las Vegas in June 2022 before walking down the aisle again in Georgia the following month. Garner, for her part, separated from the actor in 2015 after 10 years of marriage and three children — Violet, 18, Seraphina, 15, and Samuel, 12. The former couple finalized their divorce in 2018. The exes have reunited many times over the years as they continue to amicably co-parent their little ones. Lopez praised their dynamic in a 2022 Vogue interview, saying the duo “work well together.” The singer, who called the blending of their families an “emotional process” last year, is often photographed spending time with her stepkids. Their outings have continued throughout the split speculation that has surrounded Lopez and Affleck since May. When rumors began to spread, a source told Us Weekly that Garner was “encouraging” her ex-husband to “work on his marriage” as she “fully supports their relationship and wants … him to be happy.” The insider noted that the “Alias” alum is familiar with the “strain” that fame can put on a marriage. However, Affleck has been living in a rental house for months and reportedly moved his things out of his and Lopez’s $60 million marital home in Beverly Hills, Calif., as they prepare to sell it. The duo have been apart since March, Page Six reported last week. Garner has been by her ex’s side throughout the drama, from visiting Affleck’s rental to spending Father’s Day with him. The “Last Thing He Told Me” star has had a busy year herself, with her son graduating middle school and Violet heading to college. The teenager, who celebrated her high school commencement in May, appears to be committed to Yale University, based on her sweatshirt choice in a recent photo.",

                    "text": "The Jennifers are sticking together! A new report claims that Jennifer Lopez has been bonding with her husband Ben Affleck’s ex-wife Jennifer Garner amid claims that she and the Gone Girl star are having problems in their marriage. An insider said that the 13 Going On 30 star, 52, has become an “unexpected ally” for J.Lo, 54, during all the drama with Ben, 51, in a new report from Us Weekly. The insider explained that J.Lo and Jennifer have been in touch through all the marital issues, according to the story published on Tuesday, July 9. “She’s been helpful to J.Lo, and they’ve been relating to each other. Jennifer has been a surprising person for J.Lo to talk to,” they said. The source also said that the actress has “been really friendly” with J.Lo during this difficult time. They also said that Jennifer has been “very supportive” of Ben and focused on “prioritizing his well-being and their coparenting relationship.” The news about J.Lo finding solace with Ben’s ex comes shortly after another report that claims that the chances of Bennifer getting back together are “slimmer by the day,” according to Page Six. The insider told the outlet that the “Let’s Get Loud” singer was still trying to do all she can to enjoy her current moment. “She wants to have a summer full of fun and laughter,” they said. Multiple reports have been circulating about Ben and J.Lo’s marriage, and the pair have made headlines during outings when fans have been paying attention to whether or not they’re wearing their wedding rings. While the Juno actress may be an “ally” for J.Lo amid all the strife, Ben has also been seen spending time with his ex. At the end of June, the Oscar-winner was seen stopping by his ex-wife’s home in a photo. An Us Weekly report said that Jennifer has been very supportive of Ben working things out with the singer. “Jennifer Garner is encouraging Ben to work on his marriage to Jen,” they said. “She fully supports their relationship and wants nothing more than for him to be happy.”",

I've even rounded up what I learned playing the hit online word puzzle for a full year. So if you're rethinking your need for the actual answer, you might try tips from one of those stories. Still need a starter word? One person told me they just look around and choose a five-letter object that they've spotted to use as their starter word -- such as COUCH or CHAIR. I tend to stick to starter words that have the most popular letters used in English words. I like TRAIN as a starter, though I have a friend who uses TRAIL.

You have six chances to guess a five-letter word, and the game gives you feedback as to whether the letters you've guessed are in the puzzle or not, and if they're in the same spot where you guessed they are. The New York Times bought the game from creator Josh Wardle for seven figures in 2022. Wardle famously created the game for his partner, and let her narrow down the 12,000 five-letter words in the English language to just 2,500, creating the database of answers. It was convenient, too, that he has a name that plays off \"word.\" A Times spokesperson told me it lists the very first Wordle as appearing on June 19, 2021, and the paper celebrated the game's 1,000th word on March 15.

                    "title": "Newsom warns of worsening California fire season, reiterates support for Biden, says he won&#8217;t run against Harris",
                    "text": "Flanked by fire officials, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday warned Californians to be alert as the state heads into what could worse-than-expected fire season, following a brutal heat wave that has dried out vegetation and contributed to five times as many acres burning so this year statewide than normal. He also urged voters to be vigilant about the upcoming presidential election, reiterating his support for President Biden remaining the Democratic nominee and saying that California “has the most to lose” if Donald Trump wins in November. “I’m focused on supporting this campaign,” Newsom said of Biden’s re-election effort. “This candidate is a man of character, decency and honor. Contrast that with the darkness that is Donald Trump.” Asked by a reporter if he still stood by a promise he made last September not to run against Vice President Kamala Harris for president, Newsom said “Of course. Yes.” Newsom, along with Harris and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, has been mentioned often as a possible replacement for Biden as the Democratic nominee after Biden’s faltering debate performance June 27. But Newsom has said he supports Biden, and has campaigned actively for him this past week in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Flanked by helicopters, planes and fire commanders at the Cal Fire Aviation Management Unit in Sacramento, Newsom said at a news conference Wednesday that Biden quickly helped California with disaster aid following wildfires and other calamities, while Trump resisted. “In that past that was not so easy,” he said. “We had to make phone calls, we had to wait days and days, there were threats. That’s not the case today.” Newsom recalled Trump’s remarks while touring the devastation from the Camp Fire in 2018, a blaze sparked by a PG&E power line that burned the town of Paradise in Butte County to the ground, killing 85 people, the deadliest wildfire in state history. “You gotta take care of the floors. You know the floors of the forest, very important,” Trump said then. “You look at other countries where they do it differently and it’s a whole different story. I was with the president of Finland and he called it a forest nation, and they spend a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things and they don’t have any problem.” Wildfire experts noted that many of California’s wildfires have burned in national forests, which are owned and maintained by the federal government, not the state. And that while California has a mostly dry Mediterranean climate, Finland is a Nordic country where temperatures reach -45 F in the winter. Newsom said Cal Fire officials have hit their target four years in a row for thinning or conducting controlled burns on 100,000 acres or more. The state has 9,700 Cal Fire personnel this summer, compared with 6,700 in 2018, he added. On issues from the environment to abortion rights, Newsom said, the election is key. “Everything about this campaign will impact this state disproportionately,” Newsom said. “We were involved with 122 lawsuits with the Trump administration. Don’t you guys remember that? The chaos. The fear the anxiety. “He said we need to rake the forests,” Newsom added. “Daylight and darkness. This is a profound and consequential moment. This an all-in moment for all of us. This is serious for this state. No state has more to lose.” During his four years as president, Trump denied climate change science and appointed a coal industry lobbyist, Andrew Wheeler, to run the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Newsom has made climate change a centerpiece of his governorship, signing legislation to prohibit the sale of new gasoline-burning vehicles by 2035, and spending billions to expand solar, wind, offshore wind and other alternative energy projects. “We have to address the underlying cause in the first place, and that’s heat-trapping gasses,” Newsom said Wednesday. “We’ve got to address the issue of fossil fuels. We have to hold polluters accountable.” Over the past two weeks, California has endured a record heat wave, with temperatures hitting 124 degrees in Palm Springs, and 110 degrees or more in much of the Central Valley, Southern California, and parts of the Bay Area. “Over and over and over and over and over again,” Newsom said. “Record-breaking temperatures. Record-breaking experiences, not just in California, but across this country and around the rest of the world. With respect to the troglodytes out there, climate change is real. If you don’t believe in science you have to believe your own eyes.” So far this year, 207,415 acres have burned in California wildfires. That’s five times the average of the previous five years, 38,593 acres, through July 10. Although more acres have burned, there have been fewer fires: 3,543 this year, compared with a five-year average of 3,659. Cal Fire Chief Joe Tyler said two wet winters in a row built up significant amounts of grass. Several very windy days and the heat wave made fires spread quickly. But there have been no fatalities, Tyler noted, and the number of structures burned has been relatively low so far, even when recent fires threatened towns like Oroville and Mariposa. “We need to be extra cautious in these hot dry, and windy conditions,” Tyler said. He urged people to mow grass early in the morning when humidity levels are higher, and to be careful with chainsaws, grinders, tractors and other equipment that can spark fires. A leading fire scientist agreed. Until the heat wave, moisture levels in grasses and brush around the state were running near average or better, said John Abatzoglou, professor of climate science at UC Merced. Now they are near record-dry for this time of year, and summer fire risk is higher than he had expected. “The heat wave has really dried the state out,” Abatzoglou said. “It has taken fire danger from close to normal a couple of weeks ago to exceptionally dry now. It has taken the summer time drying of fuels into overdrive.”",

                    "text": "Flanked by fire officials, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday warned Californians to be alert as the state heads into what could be a worse-than-expected fire season, following a brutal heat wave that has dried out vegetation and contributed to five times as many acres burning so this year statewide than normal. He also urged voters to be vigilant about the upcoming presidential election, reiterating his support for President Biden remaining the Democratic nominee and saying that California “has the most to lose” if Donald Trump wins in November. RELATED: Gavin Newsom for president? Tallying up his assets and liabilities “I’m focused on supporting this campaign,” Newsom said of Biden’s re-election effort. “This candidate is a man of character, decency and honor. Contrast that with the darkness that is Donald Trump.” Asked by a reporter if he still stood by a promise he made last September not to run against Vice President Kamala Harris for president, Newsom said “Of course. Yes.” Newsom, along with Harris and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, has been mentioned often as a possible replacement for Biden as the Democratic nominee after Biden’s faltering debate performance June 27. But Newsom has said he supports Biden, and has campaigned actively for him this past week in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Flanked by helicopters, planes and fire commanders at the Cal Fire Aviation Management Unit in Sacramento, Newsom said at a news conference Wednesday that Biden quickly helped California with disaster aid following wildfires and other calamities, while Trump resisted. “In that past that was not so easy,” he said. “We had to make phone calls, we had to wait days and days, there were threats. That’s not the case today.” Newsom recalled Trump’s remarks while touring the devastation from the Camp Fire in 2018, a blaze sparked by a PG&E power line that burned the town of Paradise in Butte County to the ground, killing 85 people, the deadliest wildfire in state history. “You gotta take care of the floors. You know the floors of the forest, very important,” Trump said then. “You look at other countries where they do it differently and it’s a whole different story. I was with the president of Finland and he called it a forest nation, and they spend a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things and they don’t have any problem.” Wildfire experts noted that many of California’s wildfires have burned in national forests, which are owned and maintained by the federal government, not the state. And that while California has a mostly dry Mediterranean climate, Finland is a Nordic country where temperatures reach -45 F in the winter. Newsom said Cal Fire officials have hit their target four years in a row for thinning or conducting controlled burns on 100,000 acres or more. The state has 9,700 Cal Fire personnel this summer, compared with 6,700 in 2018, he added. On issues from the environment to abortion rights, Newsom said, the election is key. “Everything about this campaign will impact this state disproportionately,” Newsom said. “We were involved with 122 lawsuits with the Trump administration. Don’t you guys remember that? The chaos. The fear the anxiety. “He said we need to rake the forests,” Newsom added. “Daylight and darkness. This is a profound and consequential moment. This an all-in moment for all of us. This is serious for this state. No state has more to lose.” During his four years as president, Trump denied climate change science and appointed a coal industry lobbyist, Andrew Wheeler, to run the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Newsom has made climate change a centerpiece of his governorship, signing legislation to prohibit the sale of new gasoline-burning vehicles by 2035, and spending billions to expand solar, wind, offshore wind and other alternative energy projects. “We have to address the underlying cause in the first place, and that’s heat-trapping gasses,” Newsom said Wednesday. “We’ve got to address the issue of fossil fuels. We have to hold polluters accountable.” Over the past two weeks, California has endured a record heat wave, with temperatures hitting 124 degrees in Palm Springs, and 110 degrees or more in much of the Central Valley, Southern California, and parts of the Bay Area. “Over and over and over and over and over again,” Newsom said. “Record-breaking temperatures. Record-breaking experiences, not just in California, but across this country and around the rest of the world. With respect to the troglodytes out there, climate change is real. If you don’t believe in science you have to believe your own eyes.” So far this year, 207,415 acres have burned in California wildfires. That’s five times the average of the previous five years, 38,593 acres, through July 10. Although more acres have burned, there have been fewer fires: 3,543 this year, compared with a five-year average of 3,659. Cal Fire Chief Joe Tyler said two wet winters in a row built up significant amounts of grass. Several very windy days and the heat wave made fires spread quickly. But there have been no fatalities, Tyler noted, and the number of structures burned has been relatively low so far, even when recent fires threatened towns like Oroville and Mariposa. “We need to be extra cautious in these hot dry, and windy conditions,” Tyler said.

                    "text": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom reiterated his support Wednesday for President Biden to remain the Democratic nominee for president, even as other top Democrats and their supporters cast doubt on Biden’s future and called for him to step aside. “I’m focused on supporting this campaign,” Newsom said of Biden’s re-election effort. “This candidate is a man of character, decency and honor. Contrast that with the darkness that is Donald Trump.” Asked by a reporter if he still stood by a promise he made last September not to run against Vice President Kamala Harris for president, Newsom said “Of course. Yes.” Newsom’s remarks came during a news conference at the Cal Fire Aviation Management Unit in Sacramento to discuss the state’s worsening fire season. Newsom, along with Harris and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, has been mentioned often as a possible replacement for Biden as the Democratic nominee after Biden’s faltering debate performance June 27. But Newsom has said repeatedly that he supports Biden, and has campaigned actively for him this past week in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Michigan. “There were record crowds, unprecedented crowds of support for the president of the United states,” Newsom said. “I had 100 media outlets asking the same question, and I think I amply answered my support for the president. The support I saw on the ground was demonstrable.” Newsom, 56, has been suggested as a younger alternative to Biden, 81. Some analysts have said any attempt at the Democratic convention to bypass Harris, the nation’s first black vice president and first female vice president, however, could cause a severe split in the Democratic Party. And Biden has been adamant that he has no plans to step aside. On Wednesday, just as it looked as if he may have staved off calls for a new nominee, Biden encountered new headwinds. House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, said merely “it’s up to the president to decide” if he should stay in the race. Celebrity donor George Clooney wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times saying that Biden should not run. And Democratic senators and lawmakers expressed fresh fears about his ability to beat Republican Donald Trump. On Capitol Hill, an eighth House Democrat, Rep. Pat Ryan of New York, publicly asked Biden to step aside. “I want him to do whatever he decides to do,” Pelosi said Wednesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” rather than declaring that Biden should stay in. While Biden has said repeatedly that he’s made his decision, she said, “We’re all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short.” With the Republican National Convention set to begin Monday, it’s a crucial moment for the president and his party, as Democrats consider what was once unthinkable — having the incumbent Biden step aside, just weeks before the Democratic National Convention in Chicago that is on track to nominate him as their candidate for reelection in mid-August. Biden is hosting world leaders in Washington for the NATO summit this week. His party at a crossroads, Biden faces the next test Thursday at a news conference that many Democrats in Congress will be watching for signs of his abilities. Newsom Wednesday cited Biden’s speech at the NATO summit as an example of his gravitas. “The president stood firm in supporting NATO last night,” Newsom said, “in contrast to President Trump who said he didn’t even know what NATO was. That’s how unserious Donald Trump is. He said ‘I didn’t even know what it was when I ren for president.’ Contrast that with the steadfast support of President Biden, and his remarks last night on the 75th anniversary and the master class of managing our alliances. NATO has never been stronger and it has never been bigger.” Newsom also said that the outcome of the presidential race is particularly key for California, on issues from the environment to women’s rights. “This an all-in moment for all of us,” he said. “This is serious for this state. No state has more to lose.” “Everything about this campaign will impact this state disproportionately,” Newsom said. “We were involved with 122 lawsuits with the Trump administration. Don’t you guys remember that? The chaos. The fear the anxiety.” Newsom singled out abortion rights. “You saw an OB GYN in Louisiana who said ‘I’ll never unsee what I saw,'” Newsom said. “She said ‘I saw a young girl, 13 years old who was raped and forced to bring the baby to term, clutching a teddy bear. That’s the world we are living in under Donald Trump. That’s the world he is promoting. This is a consequential moment for all Californians and all Americans. Forgive me, but this is a very intense thing for me. When I say I’m all in, I’m all in.” Newsom appeared to be referring to Dr. Neelima Sukhavasi, a Baton Rouge physician who testified in May to the Louisiana state legislature that she and other doctors had delivered babies to teens as young as 13 in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v Wade, some with complications such as preeclampsia, placental abruption and other potential causes of serious health risk and death. Abortion rights activists had asked the Louisiana House to approve a bill to add a rape and incest exception for children under 17 to the state’s near-total abortion ban. Republicans who control the chamber voted no. “One of these teenagers delivered a baby while clutching a teddy bear,” Sukhavasi said in May. “And that’s an image, I feel like once you see that you can’t unsee.” Along with Newsom, Biden maintains strong support from key corners of his coalition, particularly the Congressional Black Caucus on Capitol Hill. “At this moment, the stakes are too high and we have to focus,” Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota told The Associated Press on Tuesday, saying Democrats are “losing ground” the longer they fight over Biden’s candidacy. “Democracy is on the line. Everything we value as Democrats, as a country, is on the line, and we have to stop being distracted.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Now, the capital port city of Juneau, where crowds have been sailing in in record numbers, is considering a limit on large cruise ships with 250 passengers or more that would cap the number of daily visitors starting in 2026 to help combat overtourism. New agreement in Alaska to limit cruise ship visitors Last month, cruise lines including Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian signed an agreement with Juneau tourism officials to help manage the thousands of passengers getting off the boats at the same time and visiting the area. While the numbers are subject to change, Sundays through Fridays, cruise crowds are expected to be capped at 16,000. That number will be limited to 12,000 on Saturdays. The new agreement expands on last year's decision to implement a limit of five cruise ships per day in Juneau. Juneau is home to some amazing outdoor attractions, such as whale watching and Mendenhall Glacier, but some local residents said they've had enough of the post-pandemic crowds. \"I personally came to the realization that Alaska was being sold as a friendly place and that my friendliness was a commodity for the cruise lines,\" resident Karla Hart told ABC News. \"The idea is just one day every week to just take a pause -- to have our community back.\" In 2023, a record 1.6 million cruise passengers visited Juneau, including Sarah Grathwohlwent, who was there for the first time earlier this spring and documented her journey on social media. \"It was beautiful to go and see a glacier -- was my first one,\" she said. \"I'm not against limiting the amount of cruise ships, I think it would make it nicer for the locals who live there year round.\" Overtourism around the world prompts new crowd management systems Scott Keyes, travel expert and founder of Going.com, said that the challenges of overtourism are not isolated to Juneau. \"We have been setting new travel records every month so far in 2024, and there's no reason to think that's going to stop,\" he told ABC News. In the U.S., Mount Rainier is among the National Parks that have begun implementing timed entry reservations to help manage large crowds. In Europe, hotspot destinations like Venice and Barcelona have implemented day trip fees for visitors. Over the weekend in Barcelona, thousands of locals protested in the streets with water guns to take a stand against tourism, which they say has resulted in a higher cost of living for residents. Due to increased demand in Athens, Greece, the city is also studying limits on tourist capacity. Experts believe that as more destinations see surges in visitors, local officials may implement restrictions to deal with crowds diplomatically. \"I'm all in favor of steps taken to try to make sure you're managing that properly and respecting the local environment and everything,\" Keyes said.",

                    "text": "As temperatures near triple digits, Houston residents remain without power following Hurricane Beryl, struggling to find relief and essential services. As of Wednesday morning, nearly 1.7 million homes and businesses were still without electricity, a decrease from the peak of over 2.7 million reported on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. Now, Texas is facing temperatures reaching into the high 90s, exacerbated by intense humidity. The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory, describing the conditions as potentially dangerous. With power outages and a lack of air conditioning, they warned about an increased risk of heat-related illnesses during these high temperatures. As residents saw Hurricane Beryl make landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, state officials faced scrutiny regarding the power utility’s preparations. After the first 36 hours, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R-TX) announced that a sports and event complex would temporarily accommodate up to 250 hospital patients awaiting discharge, unable to be released to homes without power. Patrick, who is acting as governor while Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) is abroad, said nursing homes and assisted living centers were of utmost priority. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 16 hospitals were operating on generator power Tuesday morning. Brad Tutunjian, vice president of regulatory policy at CenterPoint Energy, which serves a significant portion of the Houston area, supported the utility’s readiness and response efforts. “From my perspective to have a storm pass at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, have those crews come in in the late evening, and have everything ready by 5 a.m. to go out and get out and start the workforce is rather impressive because we’re talking about thousands of crews,” Tutunjian said at a media briefing. Beryl left at least seven dead in the United States, one in Louisiana and six in Texas, and at least 11 dead in the Caribbean. Nim Kidd, the head of the state’s division of emergency management, reassured that restoring power was the top priority. Residents complained that city and state officials failed to alert them about a storm initially forecast to make landfall much farther down the coast, leaving insufficient time to secure gas or prepare to evacuate if power was lost.",

More than 1.7 million homes and businesses in Texas lacked electricity Wednesday morning, down from a peak of over 2.7 million on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us. State officials faced questions over whether the power utility that covers much of the area had sufficiently prepared. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said that a sports and event complex would be used to temporarily hold up to 250 hospital patients who are awaiting discharge but cannot be released to homes with no power. Beryl, which made landfall in Texas early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane, has been blamed for at least seven U.S. deaths — one in Louisiana and six in Texas — and at least 11 in the Caribbean. It weakened as it moved deeper into the U.S. and early Wednesday was a post-tropical cyclone centered over northeastern Indiana. A flood watch was in effect for parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. The storm spawned suspected tornadoes in parts of Indiana and Kentucky. In the Houston area, Beryl compounded and repeated the misery of May, when storms killed eight people and left nearly 1 million without power. High temperatures Tuesday climbed into the 90s (above 32.2 Celsius) with humidity that made it feel even hotter. Similar heat and humidity were expected Wednesday. The National Weather Service described the conditions as potentially dangerous, given the lack of power and air conditioning. People coped as best they could. Kyuta Allen took her family to a Houston community center to cool down and use the internet. “During the day you can have the doors open, but at night you’ve got to board up and lock up — lock yourself like into a sauna,” she said. An executive for CenterPoint Energy, which covers much of the Houston area, defended the utility’s preparation and response. “From my perspective, to have a storm pass at 3 p.m. in the afternoon, have those crews come in in the late evening, and have everything ready by 5 a.m. to go out and get out and start the workforce is rather impressive, because we’re talking about thousands of crews,” said Brad Tutunjian, vice president of regulatory policy.
