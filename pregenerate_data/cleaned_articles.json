        "body_text": "Title: A Brief Overview of our Furry Felines: Cats \n\nCats, also known as Felis catus, play a beloved role in countless households worldwide. These furry companions are valued for their easy maintenance, playful behavior, and often, their aloof charm, making them one of the most popular pet choices next to dogs.  \n\nCats are a highly diverse species with over 60 recognized breeds, each featuring distinct physical characteristics, temperaments, and health profiles. From the sleek, ebony-coated Oriental Shorthair to the grand, majestic Maine Coon, their diversity is simply astounding. Moreover, each cat, regardless of breed, has its unique personality traits, making them endearing and fascinating pets. \n\nUnknown to many, cats are essentially crepuscular creatures, meaning they are most active during dawn and dusk. Despite our domestic cats' indoor lifestyle, they retain this instinct from their far-off ancestors who used these times to hunt, avoiding bigger predators active during the day or night. Hence, your cat's sudden midnight sprint isn't random but a regular exercise of these primal instincts.\n\nCats have also significantly contributed to human well-being. Numerous studies highlight the therapeutic role of cats in reducing stress and anxiety, with their soft purrs and warm cuddles acting as effective natural relaxants. Moreover, owning a cat encourages responsibility in children and provides companionship for individuals of all ages, thereby improving emotional health.\n\nContrary to popular belief, a cat's purr isn't always a sign of contentment. They also purr when stressed, injured or unwell. Therefore, cat owners need to stay attuned to their pet's behavior, as these subtle signs could indicate potential health issues needing prompt attention.\n\nIn conclusion, cats are a fascinating mix of independence and companionship. They are low maintenance compared to other pets and offer unmatchable charm, making them a delightful addition to any family. They, like all pets, require attention and care to ensure they lead a happy, contented life. No wonder they have earned the title as one of man’s favorite domestic companions.\n",

The monarch, 75, attended the annual public celebration of his birthday on June 15 in London, marking the second Trooping the Colour of his royal reign. The event, featuring a stunning procession of military personnel and a Royal Air Force flypast soaring through the skies over the city, has marked the British monarch's official birthday for over 260 years. It was confirmed on May 30 that King Charles would attend the event amid his cancer treatment with a small change in his participation. Instead of riding on horseback as he did in previous years, the royal took part in the procession seated in a horse-drawn carriage alongside Queen Camilla.\n\nFor the ceremony, the King wore the tunic of the Guard of Honour Order made of bearskin with a blue garter sash, in honor of the regiment's color being trooped, with the cypher of his mother and predecessor, Queen Elizabeth, and decorations of Noble Order military and knight garters. King Charles also wore a selection of medals, including Queen Elizabeth’s 1953 Coronation medal, along with the late monarch's jubilee medals from throughout her reign, from the silver to platinum, obtained in 2022. Camilla, meanwhile, wore a pale green silk crepe dress and coat by Anna Valentine and a hat by favored royal designer Philip Treacy. The monarch, who is Colonel-in-Chief of the Grenadier Guards, accessorized her look with her Grenadier Guards military brooch.\n\nQueen Elizabeth switched from participating in the event on horseback to riding in a coach when she was 60, 15 years younger than her heir is now. The history-making monarch, who died in September 2022, last rode during Trooping the Colour in 1986 on her beloved horse Burmese. King Charles first attended Trooping the Colour at age 3 when it celebrated his grandfather, King George VI. For his debut, the future monarch rode in a carriage with his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and his aunt, Princess Margaret. His mother, the then-Princess Elizabeth before she acceded to the throne the following year, was riding horseback in the procession.\n\nLast year, King Charles was joined by Prince William, Prince Edward (a first for the Duke of Edinburgh!) and Princess Anne on horseback while other members of the royal family rode in carriages. Members of the royal family again joined King Charles on the big day, including his daughter-in-law Kate Middleton in her first public appearance since announcing her cancer diagnosis in March. The Princess of Wales, 42, shared her plan to attend Trooping the Colour the day prior, writing in a personal message, \"I’m looking forward to attending the King’s Birthday Parade this weekend with my family and hope to join a few public engagements over the summer, but equally knowing I am not out of the woods yet.\"\n\nA Buckingham Palace spokesperson said on June 14, \"His Majesty is delighted that the princess is able to attend tomorrow’s events and is much looking forward to all elements of the day.\" \n\nThe Trooping the Colour festivities began when the procession departed Buckingham Palace, heading down The Mall in London to Horse Guards Parade at St. James’s Park.

        "title": "Joe Alwyn Breaks Silence on Taylor Swift Breakup: \"A Hard Thing to Navigate\"",
        "body_text": "Joe Alwyn has broken his silence on the end of his relationship with Taylor Swift, over a year after their breakup. The actor sat down with The Sunday Times Style Magazine ahead of the release of his upcoming film, Yorgos Lanthimos' \"Kinds of Kindness,\" on June 21. During the conversation, Alwyn spoke candidly about his breakup with the global superstar in April 2023. \n\nWhile he is the first to address their breakup publicly, Swift's newest album, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" seemingly addresses it, with songs like \"So Long, London\" and \"The Black Dog.\" The album title itself resembles a WhatsApp group chat Alwyn has with Andrew Scott and Paul Mescal called \"The Tortured Man Club.\" \n\nWhen asked if he had listened to the album, Alwyn didn’t directly answer. Instead, he told the publication, \"I would hope that anyone and everyone can empathize and understand the difficulties that come with the end of a long, loving, fully committed relationship of over six and a half years. That is a hard thing to navigate. What is unusual and abnormal in this situation is that, one week later, it’s suddenly in the public domain and the outside world is able to weigh in.\"\n\nOnce the news broke that the two had parted ways, the \"Conversations With Friends\" star noted that their \"very real\" experience was suddenly thrown into the \"very unreal space\" of tabloids, social media, and the press, where it was \"dissected, speculated on, pulled out of shape beyond recognition.\" \"And the truth is, to that last point, there is always going to be a gap between what is known and what is said,\" he explained. \"I have made my peace with that.\"\n\nSwifties have long speculated that Alwyn was the one who wanted to keep their relationship private, and the actor emphasized in his interview with the U.K. publication that they decided that together, and he wanted to continue to keep the more private details to himself. \"It was never something to commodify, and I see no reason to change that now,\" Alwyn said, adding, \"Look, this is also a little over a year ago now, and I feel fortunate to be in a really great place in my life — professionally and personally. I feel really good.\"\n\nElsewhere in their conversation, the \"Harriet\" actor opened up about his experience working with Lanthimos for the second time on \"Kinds of Kindness,\" which also stars Emma Stone, a longtime friend of Swift and regular collaborator of the director. The film's star-studded cast also includes Willem Dafoe, Margaret Qualley, Jesse Plemons, and Hunter Schafer, among others. In the project, Alwyn plays a single father who is trying to get his wife (Stone) back from a cult. \"Even though Yorgos really goes into dark corners in his work, he keeps a light atmosphere on set. It's the second time I’ve worked with him and with Emily,\" he said, referring to Stone by her birth name, which she previously told The Hollywood Reporter she would like to go by professionally. \"I love them both, and I love working with them, so it felt comfortable.\"\n\nFollowing Alwyn and Swift's breakup, the Grammy-winning artist began a very public relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. She made her first appearance at a Chiefs football game in September 2023 and attended 12 other games last season, including the Super Bowl, where the Chiefs won for the second year in a row.",

        "body_text": "The Israel Defense Forces announced on Saturday that eight soldiers were killed in southern Gaza in the deadliest attack on Israeli forces in months. Only one of the dead troops was identified by the army. No further information was immediately available. In January, 21 Israeli troops were killed in a single attack by Palestinian militants in Gaza. The deaths will likely fuel calls for a cease-fire and heighten Israeli public anger over ultra-Orthodox exemptions from the military. Months of cease-fire negotiations have failed to find common ground between Israel and Hamas. \n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Hamas proposed changes to a U.S.-backed plan, some of which he said were \"workable\" and some not, without elaborating. Last month, Israel's Supreme Court ordered an end to government subsidies for many ultra-Orthodox men who don't serve in the army. Their exemption from military service has angered large swathes of Israeli society during the eight-month war. Israel's coalition government contains a powerful bloc of ultra-Orthodox parties that have been longtime partners of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIsrael's bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 37,000 Palestinians, according to health officials, who don't give the breakdown of civilians and fighters. The war has also driven about 80% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes, and Israeli restrictions and ongoing fighting have hindered efforts to bring in humanitarian aid, fueling widespread hunger. Israel launched its campaign after Hamas and other militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostages. Over 100 hostages were released during a weeklong cease-fire last year in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Hamas is believed to be holding around 80 hostages and the remains of another 40.",

        "body_text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to LinkedIn \n\nChad Gable vs. Sami Zayn at WWE Clash at the Castle 2024. Credit: WWE.com\n\nSami Zayn defeated Chad Gable at WWE Clash at the Castle in a heated match. Zayn was able to win the match with a Helluva Kick after Otis defiantly carried an injured Maxxine Dupri out of the OVO Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF Hydro Arena. A hot crowd in Scotland was fully behind Sami Zayn, chanting for the popular babyface while calling Chad Gable a \"wanker.\" Fans also chanted for Otis as they begged for him to do the right thing and betray his \"Master\" Chad Gable.\n\nSami Zayn and Chad Gable arguably had the best feud heading into the five-match WWE Clash at the Castle show. With Gable’s contract reportedly coming due, WWE finally gave the talented star the push he has deserved for years now. Following a red-hot run alongside Jason Jordan as American Alpha in NXT, Gable toiled aimlessly on the main roster. Gable’s lowest moment came when he was made to portray \"Shorty G\" in 2019 at Vince McMahon’s behest. From there, Gable formed the Alpha Academy, which was essentially the modern-day version of the Social Outcasts. But after Gable offered counsel to Sami Zayn ahead of Sami’s record-breaking win over GUNTHER, Gable was allowed to layer his character, turn heel and suddenly find himself as one of the top heels on the Raw roster.\n\nOtis was at the center of Sami and Chad’s feud, as the precocious Superstar finds himself conflicted between listening to his abusive coach and taking Sami Zayn’s advice by branching out on his own. Gable is taking no prisoners, as Alpha Academy members Maxxine Dupri, Akira Tozawa, and Otis have been held against their will in what is now a cult-like stable.\n\nWhat made Gable vs. Zayn especially delectable is the uncertainty of who would win. Was Otis going to finally stand up for himself and cost Gable the Intercontinental Championship? Was Otis going to accidentally cost Sami the match in a fit of rage, leading to tension between Zayn and Otis? And at what point will the Creed Brothers get involved as WWE continues to tease Gable recruiting the blue-chip athletes?\n\nIn the end, Chad Gable has momentum to give away, even though he did not leave Scotland with the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Everything that Chad Gable has been as a heel, Otis has been the antithesis as a sympathetic babyface. And as Otis charts his path toward revenge against Gable, there’s a good chance this could ultimately end in not only Chad Gable’s first singles title win, but also a star-making Intercontinental Championship win for Otis.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

With the NBA apparently close to a new national TV rights deal with ESPN, NBC, and Amazon, the future of Inside and the entire crew is unclear. However, there is a general sense that Barkley will find himself a new TV home if needed, as he has an out in his contract to leave if TNT loses the NBA. \n\nAfter Game 4 of the NBA Finals, Barkley was on the NBATV set in Dallas and announced that he’s not going to any other network. Instead, Barkley revealed he would be retiring after next season, which will be his 25th on television, regardless of whether TNT gets a piece of the package or not. He said, \"I just want to say thank you to my entire NBA family. I love you guys. There’s been a lot of noise around our network the last few months, and I just want to say, I talked to all the other networks, but I ain't going nowhere other than TNT.

And I just want to say thank you to my NBA family, you guys been great to me, my heart is full with joy and gratitude. But, I’m gonna pass the baton at the end of next year. I hope the NBA stays with TNT, but for me personally, I wanted you to hear it from me. Because I’m not doing anymore interviews. Don't y’all be calling me, nobody calling me.

I’d be surprised if Barkley simply rides off into the sunset never to be seen again — and I’m curious to find out how long his “no interviews” stance lasts — but if next year is indeed his last as a regular contributor from weekly NBA television, there will not be a true replacement for him because he is a legitimate 1-of-1. You can bet the other networks will try their best to talk him out of this stance, but if he’s genuinely set on calling it a career in television, he’s a first-ballot Hall of Famer behind that desk just as he was on the court.",

        "title": "UK royals unite on palace balcony as Princess of Wales returns to public view after cancer diagnosis",
        "body_text": "LONDON — Britain put on a display of birthday pageantry Saturday for King Charles III, a military parade that marked the Princess of Wales' first public appearance since her cancer diagnosis early this year. The annual event was also a show of stability by the monarchy after months in which both the king and Kate, wife of heir to the throne Prince William, have been sidelined by cancer treatment. In a symbolic display of unity, Charles, Queen Camilla, William, Kate and their children were joined by other members of the royal family on a Buckingham Palace balcony at the end of the King's Birthday Parade. The family waved to the gathered crowd as they watched a flyby of military aircraft to cap ceremonies marking the monarch's official birthday. \n\nIt was the first time Kate has appeared in public since December. She disclosed in March that she was undergoing chemotherapy for an unspecified form of cancer. \"I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days,\" Kate said in a statement released Friday, adding that she faces \"a few more months\" of treatment. Kate said she is \"not out of the woods yet\" and officials stress that Saturday's engagement does not herald a full return to public life.\n\nHuge crowds turn out each June to watch the birthday parade, also known as Trooping the Color, which begins with a procession involving horses, musicians, and hundreds of soldiers in ceremonial uniform from Buckingham Palace. The first public sight of the 42-year-old princess came when she traveled in a horse-drawn carriage from the palace down the grand avenue known as the Mall with her children George, 10, Charlotte, 9, and 6-year-old Louis. Bystanders cheered as they caught a glimpse of Kate, dressed in a white dress by designer Jenny Packham and wearing a wide-brimmed Philip Treacy hat. She watched the ceremony with the children from the window of a building overlooking Horse Guards Parade, a ceremonial parade ground in central London. Louis yawned broadly at one point in the proceedings but mostly watched intently.\n\nPrince William, in military dress uniform, rode on horseback for the ceremony, in which troops parade past the king with their regimental flag, or \"color.\" The display of precision marching and martial music stems from the days when a regiment's flag was an essential rallying point in the fog of battle. Charles, who also is being treated for an undisclosed form of cancer, traveled in a carriage with Queen Camilla, rather than on horseback as he did last year. The king inspected the troops from a dais on the parade ground, saluting as elite regiments of Foot Guards marched past. \n\nFive regiments take it in turns to parade their color, and this year it was the turn of a company of the Irish Guards, which has Kate as its honorary colonel. The troops in scarlet tunics and bearskin hats were led onto the parade ground by their mascot, an Irish wolfhound named Seamus. Charles, 75, disclosed his cancer in February, and has recently eased back into public duties. He attended commemorations last week for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe on June 6, 1944.\n\nIn one of the many quirks of British royal convention, Saturday is not the king's real birthday — that's in November. Like his mother Queen Elizabeth II before him, Charles has an official birthday on the second Saturday in June. The date was chosen because the weather is generally good.",

        "body_text": "We had to wait more than two months, but the first Boston Red Sox vs. New York Yankees series of 2024 has arrived, and it did not take long for things to get interesting at Fenway Park. In the first inning of Friday night's series opener, Alex Verdugo hit a first-pitch home run against his former team after the crowd greeted him with boos. Here is Verdugo's blast. This is no cheapie. He hit it to dead center field and certainly seemed to enjoy himself rounding the bases. Earlier in the day Friday, Verdugo told reporters he expected to be treated \"like a Yankee\" by the Fenway Park crowd, and that he was. He heard boos on par with what Aaron Judge and Juan Soto, who doubled earlier in that first inning, heard before their at-bats. Verdugo was a solid player during his four years in Boston, though he was benched multiple times for not hustling. Last season, he was also reprimanded after he showed up late to the ballpark. Earlier this week, he said he enjoyed playing for the Red Sox but wishes they had done more to improve the team at the trade deadline in 2022 and 2023. The Yankees and Red Sox made a rare trade in December that sent Verdugo to New York for three pitching prospects. He took a .259/.314/.418 batting line and eight home runs into Friday's game. Verdugo also rates as one of the league's best defensive left fielders this year. He will be a free agent after the season. At 49-22, the Yankees took baseball's best record into this weekend's series. The Red Sox are in third place in the AL East at 35-34.",

        "title": "Alex Jones' Personal Assets to Be Sold to Pay $1.5B Sandy Hook Debt. Company Bankruptcy is Dismissed",
        "body_text": "HOUSTON — A federal judge on Friday ordered the liquidation of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' personal assets but dismissed his company’s separate bankruptcy case, leaving the immediate future of his Infowars media platform uncertain. Jones owes $1.5 billion for his false claims that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax.\n\nJudge Christopher Lopez approved converting Jones’ proposed personal bankruptcy reorganization to a liquidation. However, Lopez dismissed the case of his company, Austin, Texas-based Free Speech Systems, after failed attempts by Jones to reach an agreement with the Sandy Hook families on his proposals to reorganize the company while paying them millions of dollars.\n\nIt’s unclear what will happen to Free Speech Systems, Infowars’ parent company, which Jones built into a multimillion-dollar moneymaker over the past 25 years by selling dietary supplements and other products. Both Jones and lawyers for the Sandy Hook families expect Infowars to cease operating at some point because of the huge debt. A trustee appointed Friday in Jones’s personal bankruptcy case will oversee the liquidation and control his assets, including Infowars.\n\nThe dismissal of Free Speech Systems’ case means the families can now move to collect on the $1.5 billion in state courts in Texas and Connecticut, where they won defamation lawsuits against Jones and the company. Infowars might continue operating during the collection efforts, which could involve selling off the company’s assets.\n\nJones, who smiled as the judge dismissed the company’s case, called into Infowars after the court hearing and predicted more battles in state courts. He said, “The bizarre political attempts to hijack the operation have failed,\" adding that he would find another way to broadcast his shows if he loses Infowars.\n\nOutside the courthouse, he criticized the families for not accepting his reorganization proposals and alleged they were being used by political groups in a conspiracy to silence him. He said he would try to maximize revenues at Infowars to make money for creditors and then wind down the business in a way that takes care of its 44 employees. “This is about taking me off the air,” Jones said. “Understand that what you’ve seen in the corporate media about me has no bearing on reality.”\n\nChris Mattei, a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families, called Infowars “soon-to-be defunct” as his clients move to collect on the debt in state courts. He said the families would also pursue Jones’ future earnings. “Today is a good day,” Mattei said in a text message after the hearing. “Alex Jones has lost ownership of Infowars, the corrupt business he has used for years to attack the Connecticut families and so many others. Alex Jones is neither a martyr nor a victim. He is the perpetrator of the worst defamation in American history.”\n\nLopez had been asked to either convert Free Speech Systems’ bankruptcy reorganization to a liquidation or dismiss the case. He said his sole focus was on what would be best for the company and its creditors. He also noted that Free Speech Systems’ case appeared to be one of the longest-running of its kind in the country and was approaching a deadline to resolve it.",

This is the latest in a series of cases where tourists in the Greek islands have died or gone missing, often setting out on hikes in extremely hot temperatures. \n\nDr. Michael Mosley, a noted British TV anchor and author, was found dead last Sunday on the island of Symi. A coroner concluded that he had died the previous Wednesday, shortly after a hike over difficult, rocky terrain. Samos, like Symi, lies very close to the Turkish coast. The body of the 74-year-old Dutch tourist was discovered by a Fire Service drone in a ravine about 300 meters from where he was last seen on Sunday, walking with difficulty in the heat.\n\nAuthorities are still searching for four people reported missing in the past few days. On Friday, two French tourists were reported missing on Sikinos, a secluded Cyclades island in the Aegean Sea with fewer than 400 permanent residents. The two women, aged 73 and 64, had left their respective hotels to meet.\n\nA 70-year-old American tourist was reported missing Thursday on the small island of Mathraki in Greece’s northwest by his host, a Greek-American friend. The tourist was last seen Tuesday at a cafe with two female tourists who have since left the island. Mathraki, with a population of 100, is a heavily wooded island west of the better-known island of Corfu. Strong winds had prevented police and the fire service from reaching the island to search for the missing person as of Saturday afternoon.\n\nOn the island of Amorgos, authorities are still searching for a 59-year-old tourist reported missing since Tuesday after a solo hike in hot conditions. U.S. media identified the missing tourist as retired Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Albert Calibet of Hermosa Beach, California. Amorgos, the easternmost of the Cyclades islands, is a rocky 47-square-mile island with fewer than 2,000 inhabitants. A couple of years ago, the island had over 100,000 visitors.\n\nSome media commentary has focused on the need to inform tourists of the dangers of hiking in intense heat. Temperatures across Greece on Saturday were more than 18°F lower than on Thursday when they peaked at almost 113°F. They are expected to rise again from Sunday, although not to heat-wave levels. \n\nComments are not available on this story.",

While it doesn't match the internet speed capabilities of fiber or cable connections, satellite broadband is essential when internet access is crucial (a fact highlighted by the pandemic). \n\nWhich satellite internet provider is best? Frankly, there aren't many choices for satellite internet. Based on our analysis, Starlink offers the greatest potential, Hughesnet provides the most reliable speeds, and Viasat's new unlimited data plan could be very attractive to customers. Many people in rural America lack adequate internet access. To ensure you’re getting the best broadband experience possible, we've carefully examined available options, considering speeds, pricing, customer service, and overall value to determine the top internet options. Here’s a quick look at how the best satellite internet providers compare.\n\n**Best Satellite Internet Service Providers:**\n1. Starlink: Greatest potential\n2. Hughesnet: Most reliable speeds\n3. Viasat: Attractive unlimited data plan\n\n**How We Test Satellite Internet Providers:**\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike testing the latest smartphone, laptop, router, or kitchen tool, it’s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. Our approach involves researching pricing, availability, and speed information. We draw on our historical ISP data, provider sites, and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. Additionally, we evaluate customer satisfaction using sources like the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power.\n\nISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication. We ask three main questions:\n1. Does the provider offer reasonably fast internet speeds?\n2. Do customers get decent value for what they’re paying?\n3. Are customers happy with their service?\n\nThe providers that come closest to “yes” on all three are the ones we recommend. For more details, visit our how we test ISPs page.\n\n**How to Choose a Satellite Internet Provider:**\nFinding the right ISP for your household is not easy, especially in rural or underserved areas of the U.S. We recommend carefully considering your household's activities to determine the necessary download and upload speeds. With that knowledge, you can find a plan that fits your budget and broadband demands.

        "title": "Trump's Michigan trip will include stops at a Black church and a gathering of far-right activists.",
        "body_text": "DETROIT (AP) — Donald Trump will use back-to-back stops Saturday to court Black voters and a conservative group that has been accused of attracting white supremacists as he works to stitch together a coalition of divergent interests in battleground Michigan. Trump is scheduled to host an afternoon roundtable at an African American church in downtown Detroit. Later, he will appear at the “People’s Convention” of Turning Point Action, a group that the Anti-Defamation League says has been linked to extremists.\n\nJust 24 hours before Trump planned to address the conference, white supremacist Nick Fuentes entered Turning Point’s convention hall surrounded by cheering supporters. He was quickly escorted out by security. Fuentes created political problems for Trump after attending a private lunch with Trump and the rapper Kanye West at Trump’s Florida estate in 2022.\n\nTrump’s weekend plans underscore the evolving political forces shaping the presidential election this fall as he tries to deny Democratic President Joe Biden a second term. Few states are expected to matter more in November than Michigan, which Biden carried by less than 3 percentage points four years ago. And few voting groups matter more to Democrats than African Americans, who made up the backbone of Biden’s political base in 2020. But now, less than five months before Election Day, Black voters are showing signs of disappointment with Biden.\n\nMichael Whatley, the new chairman of the Republican National Committee, told Michigan Republicans at a dinner Friday that the state could not be more important. “Everybody knows if we don’t win Michigan, we’re not going to have a Republican in the White House,” Whatley said. “Let me be more blunt: If we don’t win Michigan, we’re not going to have Donald Trump in the White House.” He added, “We are going to determine the fate of the world in this election in November.”\n\nTrump argues he can pull in more Black voters due to his economic and border security message, and that his felony indictments make him more relatable. Democrats are offering a competing perspective. “Donald Trump is so dangerous for Michigan and dangerous for America and dangerous for Black people,” Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, who is African American, said Friday. He said it was “offensive” for Trump to come.\n\nAmong Black adults, Biden’s approval has dropped from 94% when he started his term in January 2021 to just 55%, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll published in March. About 8 in 10 Black voters have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, with roughly two-thirds saying they have a “very unfavorable” view of him, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in June. About 2 in 10 Black voters have a very or somewhat favorable view of Trump. Trump won 8% of the Black vote in 2020, according to AP VoteCast. And in what is expected to be a close election, even a modest shift could be consequential.\n\nMaurice Morrison, a 67-year-old lifelong Detroit resident, plans to attend Trump’s church appearance. Morrison acknowledged that Trump, for whom he voted twice before and plans to again, is deeply unpopular in his community and even inside his home. “Once he decided to run for president as a Republican, that automatically made him racist. That’s his middle name now — ‘Trump is racist’ — even though he’s not,” he said.",

        "body_text": "By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer\n\nPINEHURST, N.C. — The U.S. Open is a new experience for Ludvig Aberg, though his machine-like game helped him take the 36-hole lead on Friday. Pinehurst No. 2, however, is not new to him. Aberg, then a 19-year-old from Sweden, was about to start his college career at Texas Tech when he played in the 2019 U.S. Amateur at Pinehurst, losing in the second round.\n\n“I remember it was one of my first experiences playing on a really challenging golf course in America,” Aberg said. “And I thought, ‘Is this what golf in America is like?’ Luckily, it's not like this every week. But I remember it being very hard.”\n\nThe course remains tough, and Aberg demonstrated that he is up to the challenge. He didn’t miss a fairway until the eighth hole of the second round. While not immune to mistakes, he avoided big blunders, working his way to a 1-under-par 69 in extreme heat. Heading into the weekend, he led by one shot, with Bryson DeChambeau, Patrick Cantlay, and Rory McIlroy in close pursuit. Scottie Scheffler was just relieved to make the cut and get another shot at Pinehurst.\n\n“The first time I’ve played with him, the guy is like a machine from what I saw,” Tony Finau said after a 69 left him two shots behind. “He hit a lot of fairways and greens. He sure makes it look pretty easy.”\n\nAberg had a few missteps, missing two fairways and recording two bogeys. He finished the day at 5-under 135, one shot ahead of DeChambeau (69), Cantlay (71), and Thomas Detry of Belgium (67).\n\nPinehurst No. 2 was challenging not only because of the course layout but also due to a heat index nearing 100 degrees and occasional wind causing doubt. That’s just how the 24-year-old Swede likes it. \n\n“It’s not an easy course to play,” Aberg said. “But we stayed disciplined, patient, and aimed for our targets. We set out to see how many good shots we could hit today, and it worked out.”\n\nA little over a year since graduating from Texas Tech, Aberg is already ranked No. 6 in the world, has won on both sides of the Atlantic, played in a Ryder Cup, and was runner-up in the Masters.\n\nScheffler, coming off his fifth victory of the year last week at the Memorial, went birdie-free for the first time in nearly two years. After a double bogey, he thought he was headed home following a 74, but a 5-over 145 made the cut. \n\nTiger Woods missed a crucial 12-foot par putt on the 16th hole, ending his chances. He shot 73 and missed the cut by two.\n\nDeChambeau relied more on his putting rather than power and will be in the final group with Aberg. Nine of his last ten rounds in majors have seen him in the top ten on the leaderboard. Despite a fluctuating performance, DeChambeau finished strong with a tap-in birdie on the 18th.\n\n“All in all, I was very happy with how I stayed patient and gave myself good opportunities,” DeChambeau said.",

        "title": "Celtics take season's worth of lessons into Game 5 of NBA Finals with latest chance to secure title",
        "body_text": "BOSTON (AP) — The Celtics picked the most inopportune time to play their worst game of the season. Boston’s 122-84 Game 4 loss to Dallas had all kinds of superlatives, and none of them were good. It ended the Celtics’ 10-game playoff win streak. It was the Celtics’ lowest scoring output of the season and marked the first time the Celtics have allowed the Mavericks to eclipse 100 points in the series on a stellar night for Dallas stars Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. It also reminded the Celtics that putting a championship bow on what has been one of the franchise’s most successful seasons will require the same resilience they’ve shown during a postseason in which they haven’t lost consecutive games. \n\n\"It’s a learning lesson, for sure. Got to show up and show out every night. They’re not going to roll over,” Celtics reserve Sam Hauser said. “They’re down 3-1 now. They’re desperate... They’re not going to make it easy on us.”\n\nAs humbling as Game 4’s loss was, history will be on the Celtics’ side for Game 5. While Friday’s loss was the seventh time that the Celtics have lost by 20 or more points in the finals, they are 5-1 in the previous six. The game Monday also falls on the 16th anniversary of Boston clinching its last championship in 2008.\n\n“It’s a great opportunity to respond,” said Celtics forward Jaylen Brown, who finished Game 4 with a minus-19 plus-minus – his second-worst of these playoffs and third-worst of his entire playoff career. “We just regroup. We keep our same mentality, and we come out and get ready to fight in another battle on our home floor.” \n\nIt’s also the latest chance for coach Joe Mazzulla to reinforce the lessons he has tried to instill in the team. Hauser recalled Boston’s Game 3 win when Dallas rallied to cut a 21-point fourth quarter lead to just one with less than four minutes to play. \n\n“The Mavs were on that big run at the start of the fourth there. He came in and said, ‘That was great. That makes us hungrier,’” Hauser said. “He didn’t even focus on the win, he focused on that, which was cool. It keeps all of us grounded and knowing that we have more work to do.”\n\nIt was the same tone Mazzulla tried to set during the regular season. Boston opened the season by winning its first five games before losing in overtime at Minnesota. Postgame, Mazzulla expressed excitement for his team experiencing an opponent challenging it to play its best basketball. Following another loss two nights later at Philadelphia, the Celtics reeled off six straight victories. \n\nIn February, the Celtics lost on their home court to a Los Angeles Lakers team without both LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Then Boston reeled off a season-high 11-game win streak. The Celtics are now just one more bounce-back win away from seeing those instances of adversity bear championship fruit. If they need any more consolation — each of the Celtics' previous three title-winning teams in 1984, 1986, and 2008 all lost with close-out opportunities on the road and then returned to win at home.\n\n“Close-out games are hard. Close-out games are tough,” Brown said. “They always have been like that, and you’ve got to have extreme focus. You’ve got to come out and meet their intensity to finish things out.” \n\nJayson Tatum is expecting the TD Garden crowd to bring the energy to match the moment. “I think it’s going to be as loud as it’s ever been in my seven years of being a Celtic,” he said. “Excited to go back home. Celebrate Father’s Day on Sunday and compete for a championship.”",

        "title": "Muslim pilgrims converge at Mount Arafat for daylong worship as Hajj reaches its peak",
        "body_text": "MOUNT ARAFAT, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Following the footsteps of prophets beneath a burning sun, Muslims from around the world congregated Saturday at a sacred hill in Saudi Arabia for intense, daylong worship and reflection. The ritual at Mount Arafat, known as the hill of mercy, is considered the peak of the Hajj pilgrimage. It is often the most memorable for pilgrims, who stand shoulder to shoulder, feet to feet, asking God for mercy, blessings, prosperity, and good health. The mount is about 20 kilometers (12 miles) southeast of Mecca. It’s believed that Prophet Muhammad delivered his final speech, known as the Farewell Sermon, at the sacred mount 1,435 years ago. In the sermon, the prophet called for equality and unity among Muslims.\n\n“It’s indescribable,” Ahmed Tukeyia, an Egyptian pilgrim, said on his arrival Friday evening at a tent camp at the foot of Mount Arafat. Hajj is one of the largest religious gatherings on earth. The rituals officially started Friday when pilgrims moved from Mecca’s Grand Mosque to Mina, a desert plain just outside the city. Saudi authorities expect the number of pilgrims this year to exceed 2 million, approaching pre-coronavirus pandemic levels. The pilgrimage is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. All Muslims are required to make the five-day Hajj at least once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to make the demanding pilgrimage.\n\nThe rituals largely commemorate the Quran’s accounts of Prophet Ibrahim, his son Prophet Ismail, and Ismail’s mother Hajar — or Abraham and Ismael as they are named in the Bible. This year’s Hajj came against the backdrop of the raging war in the Gaza Strip between Israel and Hamas, which pushed the Middle East to the brink of a regional war between Israel and its allies on one side and Iran-backed militant groups on the other. Palestinians in the coastal enclave of Gaza were not able to travel to Mecca for Hajj this year because of the closure of the Rafah crossing in May, when Israel extended its ground offensive to the strip’s southern city of Rafah on the border with Egypt.\n\nStaving off potential protests or chants about the war during the Hajj, Saudi authorities said they won’t tolerate politicizing the pilgrimage. The time of year when the Hajj takes place varies, given that it is set for five days in the second week of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month in the Islamic lunar calendar. Most of the Hajj rituals are held outdoors with little if any shade. When it falls in the summer months, temperatures can soar to over 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). The Health Ministry has cautioned that temperatures at the holy sites could reach 48 C (118 F). It urged pilgrims to use umbrellas and drink more water to stay hydrated.\n\nAfter Saturday’s worship in Arafat, pilgrims will travel a few kilometers (miles) to a site known as Muzdalifa to collect pebbles that they will use in the symbolic stoning of pillars representing the devil back in Mina. Pilgrims then return to Mina for three days, coinciding with the festive Eid al-Adha holiday, when financially able Muslims around the world slaughter livestock and distribute the meat to poor people. Afterward, they return to Mecca for a final circumambulation, known as Farewell Tawaf. Once the Hajj is over, men are expected to shave their heads, and women to snip a lock of hair in a sign of renewal. Most of the pilgrims then leave Mecca for the city of Medina, some 340 kilometers (210 miles) away, to pray in Prophet Muhammad’s tomb.",

        "title": "South Africa's President Ramaphosa is reelected for a second term after a dramatic late coalition deal",
        "body_text": "CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — South African President Cyril Ramaphosa was reelected by lawmakers for a second term on Friday, after his party struck a dramatic late coalition deal with a former political foe just hours before the vote. Ramaphosa, the leader of the African National Congress, won convincingly in Parliament against a surprise candidate who was also nominated - Julius Malema of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters. Ramaphosa received 283 votes to Malema’s 44 in the 400-member house. The 71-year-old Ramaphosa secured his second term with the help of lawmakers from the country’s second-biggest party, the Democratic Alliance, and some smaller parties. They backed him in the vote and got him over the finish line following the ANC’s loss of its long-held majority in a landmark election two weeks ago that reduced it to 159 seats in Parliament. During a break in what turned out to be a marathon parliamentary session, the ANC signed the last-minute agreement with the DA, effectively ensuring Ramaphosa stays on as the leader of Africa’s most industrialized economy. The parties will now co-govern South Africa in its first national coalition where no party has a majority in Parliament. The deal, referred to as a government of national unity, brings the ANC together with the DA, a white-led party that had for years been the main opposition and the fiercest critic of the ANC. At least two other smaller parties also joined the agreement. Ramaphosa called the deal - which sent South Africa into uncharted waters - a “new birth, a new era for our country” and said it was time for parties “to overcome their differences and to work together.” “This is what we shall do and this is what I am committed to achieving as the president,” he said. The ANC - the famed party of Nelson Mandela - had ruled South Africa with a comfortable majority since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. But it lost its 30-year majority in the humbling national election on May 29, a turning point for the country. The vote was held against the backdrop of widespread discontent from South Africans over high levels of poverty, inequality, and unemployment. Analysts warn there might be complications ahead, though, given the starkly different ideologies of the ANC, a former liberation movement, and the centrist, business-friendly DA, which won 21% of the vote in the national election, the second-largest share behind the ANC’s 40%. For one, the DA disagreed with the ANC government’s move to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza in a highly sensitive case at the United Nations’ top court. DA leader John Steenhuisen was the first to confirm the agreement. “From today, the DA will co-govern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration,” he said as he stepped away from Friday’s proceedings for a speech carried live on television in which he said a deal was signed and that the DA lawmakers would vote for Ramaphosa for president. The Parliament session started at 10 a.m. in the unusual setting of a conference center near Cape Town’s waterfront, after the city’s historic National Assembly building was gutted in a fire in 2022. The house first went through the hours-long swearing-in of hundreds of new lawmakers and electing a speaker and a deputy speaker. The vote for the president started late at night, with the results announced well after 10 p.m. Ramaphosa finished his acceptance speech as the clock ticked past midnight and into Saturday.",

        "title": "US Military Targets Houthi Radar Sites in Yemen After a Merchant Sailor Goes Missing",
        "body_text": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The United States military launched a series of attacks on radar sites operated by Yemen's Houthi rebels in response to their assaults on shipping in the crucial Red Sea corridor, authorities said Saturday. This followed an earlier Houthi strike on a ship that left one merchant sailor missing. The attacks come as the U.S. Navy faces its most intense combat since World War II, aimed at countering the Houthi campaign—which the rebels claim is meant to halt the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. However, the Iranian-backed Houthi assaults often target ships and sailors unrelated to the war, disrupting traffic through a vital corridor for cargo and energy shipments between Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.\n\nU.S. strikes destroyed seven radars within Houthi-controlled territory, according to the military's Central Command. Central Command did not elaborate on how the sites were destroyed and did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press. “These radars allow the Houthis to target maritime vessels and endanger commercial shipping,” Central Command said in a statement. The U.S. also destroyed two bomb-laden drone boats and a drone launched by the Houthis over the waterway, it said.\n\nThe Houthis, who have held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014, did not acknowledge the strikes or any military losses, which is typical since the U.S. began airstrikes targeting the rebels. Meanwhile, Central Command reported that one commercial sailor from the Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned bulk cargo carrier Tutor remained missing after a Wednesday attack by the Houthis using a bomb-carrying drone boat. “The crew abandoned ship and were rescued by USS Philippine Sea and partner forces,” Central Command said. The Tutor remains in the Red Sea and is slowly taking on water.\n\nThe missing sailor is Filipino, according to the state-run Philippine News Agency, which cited Migrant Workers Secretary Hans Leo Cacdac. He said most of the Tutor's 22 mariners were from the Philippines. \"We’re trying to account for the particular seafarer and are praying that we could find him,” he reportedly said Friday night.\n\nThe Houthis have launched over 50 attacks on shipping, killing three sailors, seizing one vessel, and sinking another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. A U.S.-led airstrike campaign has targeted the Houthis since January, with a series of strikes on May 30 killing at least 16 people and wounding 42 others, according to the rebels.\n\nThe war in Gaza has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, while hundreds have been killed in Israeli operations in the West Bank. It began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\n“The Houthis claim to be acting on behalf of Palestinians in Gaza, yet they are targeting and threatening the lives of third-country nationals who have nothing to do with the conflict in Gaza,” Central Command said. “The ongoing threat to international commerce caused by the Houthis makes it harder to deliver badly needed assistance to the people of Yemen as well as Gaza.”",

        "title": "Missouri woman's murder conviction tossed after 43 years. Her lawyers say a police officer did it",
        "body_text": "A judge has overturned the conviction of a Missouri woman who was a psychiatric patient when she incriminated herself in a 1980 killing that her attorneys argue was actually committed by a now-discredited police officer. Judge Ryan Horsman ruled late Friday that Sandra Hemme, who has spent 43 years behind bars, had established evidence of actual innocence and must be freed within 30 days unless prosecutors retry her. He said her trial counsel was ineffective and prosecutors failed to disclose evidence that would have helped her. Her attorneys say this is the longest time a woman has been incarcerated for a wrongful conviction. They filed a motion seeking her immediate release.\n\n“We are grateful to the Court for acknowledging the grave injustice Ms. Hemme has endured for more than four decades,” her attorneys said in a statement, promising to keep up their efforts to dismiss the charges and reunite Hemme with her family. A spokesperson for Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey didn't immediately respond to a text or email message seeking comment Saturday.\n\nHemme was shackled in leather wrist restraints and so heavily sedated that she “could not hold her head up straight” or “articulate anything beyond monosyllabic responses\" when she was first questioned about the death of 31-year-old library worker Patricia Jeschke, according to her lawyers with the New York-based Innocence Project. They alleged in a petition seeking her exoneration that authorities ignored Hemme's “wildly contradictory” statements and suppressed evidence implicating Michael Holman, a then-police officer who tried to use the slain woman's credit card. The judge wrote that “no evidence whatsoever outside of Ms. Hemme’s unreliable statements connects her to the crime.” “In contrast,” he added, “this Court finds that the evidence directly ties Holman to this crime and murder scene.”\n\nIt started on Nov. 13, 1980, when Jeschke missed work. Her worried mother climbed through a window at her apartment and discovered her daughter's nude body on the floor, surrounded by blood. Her hands were tied behind her back with a telephone cord and a pair of pantyhose was wrapped around her throat. A knife was under her head. The brutal killing grabbed headlines, with detectives working 12-hour days to solve it.\n\nBut Hemme wasn't on their radar until she showed up nearly two weeks later at the home of a nurse who once treated her, carrying a knife and refusing to leave. Police found her in a closet and took her back to St. Joseph’s Hospital, the latest in a string of hospitalizations that began when she started hearing voices at the age of 12. She had been discharged from that very hospital the day before Jeschke's body was found, showing up at her parents' house later that night after hitchhiking more than 100 miles across the state. The timing seemed suspicious to law enforcement.\n\nAs the interrogations began, Hemme was being treated with antipsychotic drugs that had triggered involuntary muscle spasms. She complained that her eyes were rolling back in her head, the petition said. Detectives noted that Hemme seemed “mentally confused” and not fully able to comprehend their questions. “Each time the police extracted a statement from Ms. Hemme, it changed dramatically from the last, often incorporating explanations of facts the police had just recently uncovered,” her attorneys wrote. Eventually, she claimed to have watched a man named Joseph Wabski kill Jeschke.",

The Princess of Wales, 42, who hasn't attended a public event with the royal family since Christmas, attended Trooping the Colour on June 15. For the day's grand finale — the Royal Air Force's flypast over London — she stood on the royal residence's balcony with her husband, Prince William, and their children, Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 9, and Prince Louis, 6. They joined King Charles (who is also undergoing treatment for cancer), Queen Camilla, and more royals for the monarch’s annual birthday parade. \n\nPrincess Kate, who wore a white dress by Jenny Packham adorned with the Irish Guards Regimental Brooch and paired with a hat by Philip Treacy, took part in the royal processional earlier in the event, riding in a horse-drawn carriage with her three children.

Thank you so much for your continued understanding, and to all of you who have so bravely shared your stories with me.\" \n\nDespite maintaining a low public profile since her cancer announcement in March, Kate was recently spotted out with her family and running errands solo, sources told PEOPLE. The Princess of Wales said in her June 14 message that she is \"starting to do a little work from home\" and expressed a \"hope to join a few public engagements over the summer.\" However, no date has been set for her to fully return to her royal duties and any outings in the coming months will be based on when she feels able and under the guidance of her medical team.",

        "body_text": "Vice President Kamala Harris announced over $1.5 billion in aid for Ukraine during a conference in Switzerland on Saturday. The conference aimed to outline steps towards achieving peace in Ukraine. Harris made the announcement at the Ukraine peace summit in Lucerne, Switzerland, where she held discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nAccording to Reuters, during the bilateral meeting with Zelenskyy, Harris said, \"This war remains an utter failure for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin. It is in our interest to uphold international norms.\" The $1.5 billion includes $500 million in new funding for energy assistance and the redirection of $324 million from previously announced funds towards emergency energy infrastructure repairs and essential needs in Ukraine, as confirmed by the vice president's office.\n\nMore than $379 million from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development will assist millions of people affected by the war, including refugees. The announcement followed a deal reached on Thursday by President Biden and leaders from the wealthiest democratic nations to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan this year, backed by frozen Russian assets. This agreement underscores a resolute commitment to counter Russia's invasion, according to U.S. officials.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been urging allies to provide increased assistance as Moscow has stepped up attacks recently in the Kharkiv area. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nSwiss officials hosting the conference stated that over 50 heads of state and government, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, were expected to attend the gathering at the Bürgenstock resort overlooking Lake Lucerne. Alongside many Western leaders, the presidents of Ecuador, Ivory Coast, Kenya, and Somalia participated, while Russia notably did not attend, reported NBC News.\n\nChina, aligned with Russia, has chosen not to participate in the conference, alongside many other nations preoccupied with pressing domestic and international issues amidst what is described as Europe's most deadly conflict since World War II. Beijing emphasizes that any effective peace process must include both Russia and Ukraine and has put forward its proposals for achieving peace in the region.",

        "body_text": "A mountain lion was found dead Saturday, June 15 on the 101 Freeway near Agoura Hills, close to the site of the wildlife crossing currently under construction over the freeway. The animal was found in the far right lane of the southbound freeway near Liberty Canyon Road, according to the California Highway Patrol. The agency said someone called about a possible animal in the road at 4:48 a.m. Wildlife advocates hope the crossing can save the threatened local population of mountain lions from extinction, which could become inevitable if lions continue a historic pattern of inbreeding due to the limited numbers of cats in the area. Construction on the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing began in 2022 and it is expected to be completed by late 2025 or early 2026. The fully landscaped crossing is designed to provide a connection between the small population of mountain lions in the Santa Monica Mountains and the larger and genetically diverse populations to the north. The crossing will be the largest of its type in the nation, officials said. Decades of road construction and development have been deadly for animals trying to cross the area’s freeways, while creating islands of habitat that have genetically isolated wildlife ranging from bobcats to birds and lizards. More information about the project is available online at 101wildlifecrossing.org.",

A representative for the Bristol Bay Borough Police Department confirmed Mavar’s death to Entertainment Weekly.

Emergency personnel transported Mavar to Camai Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead after life-saving measures were attempted. An investigation into his death is underway. \n\nMavar first appeared on \"Deadliest Catch\" in 2005, working as a deckhand on the Northwestern in the debut episode of the crab fishing reality series. Over 16 years, he appeared in 98 episodes, serving as the right-hand man for Captain Sig Hansen. \n\nIn December 2020, Mavar was airlifted to a hospital after his appendix ruptured during filming.

On Friday, June 14, a representative for the performer, known for hits like \"This Time I'll Be Sweeter,\" \"I Try,\" and \"Angel of the Night,\" told PEOPLE she passed away Thursday morning at her daughter's home in Vallejo, California. News of her death was also shared on her personal Facebook account in two separate posts on Friday. \n\n“ON BEHALF OF MY DEAR FRIEND ANGIE, I AM SADDENED TO ANNOUNCE HER PASSING ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 13,” the first post read, adding that her funeral will be held at St. Dominick's Church in California on June 28 at 1 p.m. A second update clarified, “JUST TO CLEAR UP THE CONFUSION. ON BEHALF OF SHAUNA BOFILL, HUSBAND CHRIS PORTUGUESE, WE ARE SADDENED BUT MUST REPORT THAT THE PASSING OF ANGELA YESTERDAY IS INDEED TRUE. WE THANK MELBA MOORE AND MAYSA FOR THEIR EARLY CONDOLENCES. THANKS FOR YOUR MANY POSTS.” The message was signed by her friend and manager, Rich Engel.\n\nIn a December 2020 interview with Essence magazine, Bofill discussed her life and career, addressing rumors of her death that had circulated online just months before. Laughing at the time, the “I’m on Your Side” singer mentioned she discovered the death hoax after receiving many calls to confirm if it was true. “Friends calling up, ‘Oh my God, am I talking to the ghost of Angela Bofill?’ Thank God it’s not true,” she told the outlet. When asked about seeing the tributes pour in, she replied, “You always must welcome love.” “I figured, ‘They really like me!’ [I’m just] laughing at it, really. It’s better to have a sense of humor,” she continued. She added that she had a will to live to see her grandchildren graduate from high school and college.\n\nRumors of Bofill’s death in 2020 followed previous health complications after she suffered two strokes in 2006 and 2007. Speaking to The Denver Post in 2011 after a five-year hiatus to focus on her health, Bofill expressed happiness about returning to performing. “I feel happy performing again,” Bofill said. “I need crowd. In the blood, entertain. Any time a crowd comes to see me, I’m surprised. No sing no more and still people come. Wow. Impressed,” she told the publication. \n\nEngel also spoke with the Post at the time, recalling Bofill’s career during the 1970s and ‘80s. “She had a rare voice,” he said. “She could hit low notes and high C. Her pitch was perfect.” \n\nWhile discussing complications from her strokes, such as learning to walk again and her voice not being the same, Bofill remained positive. “But my voice no sing. I rather not sing. Awful. Crack me up! Funny! I laugh about it. But very grateful — still living. Never take things for granted,” she said.\n\nBofill began recording in her teens and released her first studio album, Angie, in 1978. She continued recording new albums into the 1990s. Some of her other hit singles include \"Something About You,\" \"I'm on Your Side,\" \"Let Me Be the One,\" and \"I Just Wanna Stop.\"",

        "body_text": "PARIS (AP) — Antiracism groups will join French unions and a new left-wing coalition in protests in Paris and across France on Saturday against the surging nationalist far-right as campaigning intensifies ahead of snap parliamentary elections. In Paris, those who fear the elections could produce France’s first far-right government since World War II will gather at Place de la Republique before marching through eastern Paris. \n\nCrowds have been gathering daily since Marine Le Pen’s anti-immigration National Rally made significant gains in the European Parliament elections on Sunday, defeating President Emmanuel Macron’s pro-business moderates and prompting him to dissolve the National Assembly. New elections for the lower house of parliament are set for June 30 and July 7. \n\nMacron remains president until 2027 and oversees foreign policy and defense, but his administration would be weakened if the National Rally wins and takes power over the government and domestic policy. \"We need a democratic and social upsurge — if not the extreme right will take power,\" French unions said in a statement Friday. \"Our Republic and our democracy are in danger.\" They noted that in Europe and across the world, extreme-right leaders have passed laws detrimental to women, the LGBTQ+ community, and people of color.\n\nTo prevent the National Rally party from winning the upcoming elections, left-wing parties finally agreed Friday to set aside differences over the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine and form a coalition. They urged French citizens to defeat the far right. \n\nFrench opinion polls suggest the National Rally — whose founder has been repeatedly convicted of racism and antisemitism — is expected to lead in the first round of the parliamentary elections. The party came out on top in the European elections, garnering more than 30% of the votes cast in France, almost twice as many as Macron’s party, Renaissance.\n\nMacron’s term continues for three more years, and he retains control over foreign affairs and defense regardless of the parliamentary election results. However, his presidency would be weakened if the National Rally wins, potentially putting its 28-year-old party leader Jordan Bardella on track to become the next prime minister, with authority over domestic and economic affairs.",

However, it hasn't offered much excitement so far, as the Panthers have dominated every key moment, leading to a 3-0 series advantage over the Oilers. \n\nLooking to become the 20th team to complete a sweep in the Cup Final, Florida is a slight underdog in Game 4 in Edmonton on Saturday night. Historically, 71% of teams with a 3-0 lead have won Game 4. The only team to overcome a 3-0 deficit and win the Stanley Cup was the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs. Can Edmonton replicate that feat? If so, it must begin Saturday night. Here’s a prediction and pick for Game 4.\n\nPanthers vs. Oilers Game 4 odds:\n- Moneyline: Panthers +100, Oilers -120\n- Puck Line: Panthers +1.5 (-275), Oilers -1.5 (+220)\n- Total: Over 5.5 (+100), Under 5.5 (-120)\nOdds via BetMGM\n\nPanthers vs. Oilers Game 4 prediction:\nDespite the Oilers’ power rating and analytical profile, they are still slight favorites in this game. The Oilers hold a 50.34% expected goal share in the series and have 22 more shots on goal than Florida. However, these stats may not translate to changing the outcome. The Panthers are avoiding critical mistakes and excelling in defensive play. Most of Florida’s recent goals resulted from severe defensive breakdowns by the Oilers.\n\nCody Ceci and Darnell Nurse have faced significant criticism for their defensive play, and Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch has heavily relied on the Mattias Ekholm and Evan Bouchard pairing, which appears fatigue. Conversely, Florida's goalie, Sergei Bobrovsky, has been dependable, with a +6.2 goals-saved-above-expected rating, potentially making him a Conn Smythe trophy contender.\n\nPanthers vs. Oilers Game 4 pick:\nWhile the Oilers are unlikely to give up easily, it's hard to see why they remain favorites. There's value in betting on the Panthers at better than even money.\n\nPick: Panthers moneyline (+102 at FanDuel)",

        "title": "US supports 'a just and lasting peace' for Ukraine, Harris tells Zelenskyy at Swiss summit",
        "body_text": "Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday pledged America's full support for Ukraine and global efforts to achieve \"a just and lasting peace\" in the face of Russia's invasion. Representing the United States at an international gathering on the war, she met with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss his country's vision for ending the conflict. As she arrived at the meeting venue overlooking Lake Lucerne for a 28-hour trip from Washington and back, Harris announced $1.5 billion in U.S. assistance through the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. This includes funding for energy assistance, repairing damaged energy infrastructure, helping refugees, and strengthening civilian security in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's aggression.\n\n\"War is not our choice. It's Putin's choice,\" Zelenskyy said alongside Harris before their private meeting. \"And with this summit today, we will do everything we can to start moving toward real peace.\" Harris responded: \"I am here today to stand with Ukraine and the leaders from around the world in support of a just and lasting peace.\" She added, \"As we look forward to that peace and work toward it, the United States is committed to helping Ukraine rebuild.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden was in Los Angeles after three days at the Group of Seven summit in Italy, where he held talks with Zelenskyy. He flew from Europe to California for a Saturday night fundraiser with Hollywood A-listers George Clooney and Julia Roberts. This decision to skip the summit on Ukraine highlights the competing election-year demands Biden faces as he balances a complicated domestic and foreign policy agenda while running against former President Donald Trump. It also reflects Vice President Harris's growing profile in making the case for a second Biden term as the 2024 campaign heats up.\n\n\"Being vice president means you take a lot of hits for the team,\" said Matt Bennett, who served as an aide to former Vice President Al Gore. \"In the past, these moments on the global stage have been good for her. She looks presidential and very capable among world leaders.\" Zelenskyy, for months, publicly lobbied Biden and other world leaders to take part in the meeting, warning that their absence could further embolden Putin in his ongoing war. Biden ultimately decided to send Harris and White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan to represent the administration.\n\n\"Skipping the summit is a missed opportunity for the president and for the United States,\" said Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington. \"That said, sending the vice president with the national security adviser is not exactly sending the junior varsity team.\"\n\nBiden has increasingly relied on Harris as he tries to reassemble the coalition of voters needed to win a second term. Harris has taken a more visible role in advocating for Biden to a diverse cross-section of the Democratic base. She visited an abortion clinic in Minneapolis to highlight the administration's record on the issue. She has launched efforts to emphasize economic development during Biden's tenure, with a particular focus on minority communities. Additionally, she has traveled across the country to discuss issues such as marijuana legislation and gun violence as Biden's support from the coalition that elected him in 2020 shows signs of fluctuating.",

        "title": "Prince Louis Steals the Show as He Dances, Yawns and Plays with Curtain Cords at Trooping the Colour",
        "body_text": "Prince Louis is once again stealing the show at Trooping the Colour. The 6-year-old prince appeared with his family at King Charles' birthday parade in London on June 15, and he quickly won the internet's hearts again while watching the presentation from the Major General's Office overlooking Horse Guards' Parade. In a funny clip posted on X (formerly Twitter), Prince Louis was seen swaying his hips from side to side as he danced to the band's music. Although his moves seemed to get a laugh from mom Kate Middleton, his older sister Princess Charlotte seemed less than impressed! The 9-year-old princess appeared to tell Louis to \"stop\" as she exchanged words with him. In another cute moment, Prince Louis played with a curtain cord as he sat and chatted with Princess Kate, 42. Prince Louis was spotted in another clip shared on social media, yawning on the balcony during the ceremony. He memorably let out a similarly big yawn at King Charles' coronation at Westminster Abbey on May 6, 2023. Shortly after, he left the crowning ceremony for a little bit before rejoining his family for the carriage ride back to Buckingham Palace and balcony appearance after. \n\nPrince Louis, who sported his go-to ensemble for royal events—shorts with knee socks paired with a blazer and tie—rode in a horse-drawn carriage with Princess Kate and siblings Prince George and Princess Charlotte for the procession through London, riding in the Glass Coach to shield them amid the gloomy weather. Built in 1881 and purchased for King George V’s coronation in 1911, the carriage has been used in many royal events and even brought royal brides to their weddings, including Princess Anne in 1973, Princess Diana in 1981, and Sarah Ferguson in 1986. Prince Louis and Princess Kate sat side-by-side facing forward while Prince George and Princess Charlotte sat across from them for the journey from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards' Parade. \n\nPrince William and Princess Kate's joint social media page posted an Instagram Reel of their arrival at the ceremony on June 15 as they headed into the horse-drawn carriage to the parade. “All set for The King’s Birthday Parade!” their team wrote in the caption. In the clip, Prince Louis waved as he waited with Princess Kate and his siblings to be seated in the carriage. Kate’s attendance at Trooping the Colour marks her first public appearance since announcing her cancer diagnosis in March. The Princess of Wales’ appearance comes after she confirmed she would be attending the parade on June 15, as she shared a candid message on her health status and recovery amid chemotherapy following her cancer diagnosis.\n\nOne of the youngest royal family members is known for showing off his playful personality at royal events. At Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2022, he brought charm and laughter to the festivities due to his enthusiastic waves, animated faces, and interactions with his older siblings. \"He's a cheeky monkey—a typical third child,\" someone who knows the family told PEOPLE following the celebration of Queen Elizabeth's 70 years on the throne. \"It's nice that the world got to see him enjoying himself.\" Even Prince William and Princess Kate couldn't help but acknowledge their son's scene-stealing behavior. The royal couple ended the four days of celebrations by sharing a social media post that said, \"We all had an incredible time, especially Louis…\" with the eyes emoji.",

        "title": "Many Senate Republicans were done with Trump after Jan. 6. Now they want him back in the White House.",
        "body_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Three years ago, Donald Trump had few friends left in the Senate. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell declared in a speech that Trump was “practically and morally responsible” for the violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by spreading falsehoods about election fraud and trying to overturn his reelection defeat. After the House impeached Trump for his actions, seven Republicans stood with Democrats and declared Trump guilty. He was acquitted, but several GOP senators — even some who still publicly supported him — distanced themselves from the former president. Many were certain his political future was over.\n\nBut it wasn’t. Trump is now the party’s presumptive nominee to challenge President Joe Biden. And on Thursday, he returned to Capitol Hill to meet with Republicans — his first such official meetings since his presidency — to enthusiastic and near-unanimous support from the Senate GOP conference, including many of the same senators who condemned him for his actions. McConnell shook his hand multiple times and gave him a fist bump. The hard feelings, and any memories of the violent end to his presidency, seemed to have faded completely.\n\n“I think that’s in the rearview mirror for most people,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said of the 2020 election. “There will always be tension there. But I think most Republicans really see President Trump as the only way to turn this country around. And they’re enthusiastic about the chance.”\n\nRepublican senators’ embrace of the former president comes after years of ups and downs. With a few exceptions, senators have never backed him as consistently and eagerly as their GOP counterparts in the House. But as he runs again, Senate Republicans are backing Trump more enthusiastically than ever.\n\nThe zealous Senate support is partly rooted in self-interest. Republicans have a good shot at winning the Senate majority in November, and they know Trump’s support is key to doing that, especially in solidly Republican states like Ohio and Montana where Democratic incumbents are struggling to hold on. And they are already starting to talk about what they will do if Trump wins and they gain both chambers of Congress. House Speaker Mike Johnson visited a Senate GOP luncheon Wednesday to discuss the possibility of tax legislation, among other things, if Republicans win full control.\n\n“Our ability to get a majority in the Senate is intrinsically linked to Trump winning,” Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said after the meeting with Johnson. “So we’re like, one team, one vision.”\n\nTexas Sen. John Cornyn, who is running to replace McConnell as GOP leader when he steps down from that post in November, said the party faces a “binary choice” between Trump and Biden. “There is no Plan B,” said Cornyn, who had called Trump “reckless” after the Capitol attack. “I think people know the strengths and weaknesses of both candidates. And for me, I think President Trump is clearly preferable.” Also, Cornyn added, “his support is going to be important in a lot of these states where he’s very popular, where we have Senate races.”\n\nIt’s hardly the first time Republicans have returned to supporting Trump after attempting a clean break. The arguments, and the whiplash, are a familiar pattern. McConnell, for example, fully backed Trump in the days before he was elected in 2016, just weeks after the release of a decade-old ...",

        "title": "Luka Doncic scores 29, Mavericks roll past the Celtics 122-84 to avoid a sweep in the NBA Finals",
        "body_text": "DALLAS (AP) — There were two options for the Dallas Mavericks: pack for Boston or pack for vacation. Boston awaits. These NBA Finals are not over, thanks to one of the biggest blowouts in title-round history. Luka Doncic scored 25 of his 29 points in the first half, Kyrie Irving added 21, and the Mavericks emphatically extended their season on Friday night, fending off elimination with a 122-84 rout of the Celtics in Game 4. The 38-point final margin was the third-biggest ever in an NBA Finals game, behind only Chicago beating Utah 96-54 in 1998 and the Celtics beating the Los Angeles Lakers 131-92 in 2008.\n\n\"It's real simple. We don't have to complicate this. This isn't surgery,\" Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. \"Our group was ready to go. They were ready to celebrate, and we made a stand. We were desperate. We've got to continue to keep playing that way. They're trying to close the door. The hardest thing in this league is to close the door when you have a group that has nothing to lose. Tonight, you saw that.\"\n\nThe Mavs' stars were done by the end of the third quarter, with good reason. It was all Dallas from the outset, leading by 13 after one quarter, 26 at the half, and by as many as 38 in the third before both sides emptied the benches. Before Friday, the worst NBA Finals loss for the 17-time champion Celtics was 137-104 to the Lakers in 1984. This was worse, much worse. Dallas' biggest lead in the fourth was 48 — the biggest deficit the Celtics have faced all season. The Celtics still lead the series 3-1, and Game 5 is in Boston on Monday.\n\n\"Preparation doesn't guarantee an automatic success,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"I thought we had a great process. I thought we had a great shootaround. I thought we had a great film session yesterday. I thought the guys came out with the right intentions. I just didn't think it went our way, and I thought Dallas outplayed us. They just played harder.\"\n\nThe loss — Boston's first in five weeks — snapped the Celtics' 10-game postseason winning streak, the longest in franchise history, plus took away the chance they had at being the first team in NBA history to win both the conference finals and the finals in 4-0 sweeps. Jayson Tatum scored 15 points, Sam Hauser had 14, while Jaylen Brown and Jrue Holiday each finished with 10 for the Celtics. Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 15 points, all in the fourth quarter, and Dereck Lively II had 11 points and 12 rebounds for Dallas.\n\nIt was Lively who provided the hint that it was going to be a good night for the Mavs in the early going.

        "title": "World leaders to meet at Swiss resort on possible Ukraine peace roadmap. Russia is notably absent",
        "body_text": "GENEVA -- The presidents of Ecuador, Ivory Coast, Kenya, and Somalia will join many Western heads of state and government and other leaders at a conference this weekend aimed at plotting out first steps toward peace in Ukraine – with Russia notably absent. Swiss officials hosting the conference say more than 50 heads of state and government, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, will join the gathering at the Bürgenstock resort overlooking Lake Lucerne. Some 100 delegations, including European bodies and the United Nations, will be present. \n\nThe attendance or absence of key figures has become a significant aspect of the meeting. Critics argue the meeting will be futile without the presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and is continuing the war. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is set to attend, while Turkey and Saudi Arabia have sent their foreign ministers. Key developing countries like Brazil, India, and South Africa will be represented at lower levels. China, which supports Russia, is among the countries not attending the conference, many of which have more pressing issues than the conflict in Europe.\n\nBeijing insists that any peace process requires the participation of both Russia and Ukraine and has proposed its own peace ideas. Zelenskyy recently led a diplomatic push to gather participants. Russian troops, who now control nearly a quarter of Ukrainian land in the east and south, have made some territorial gains in recent months. When the idea of a Swiss-hosted peace initiative began last summer, Ukrainian forces had recently regained large areas of territory, especially near the cities of Kherson in the south and Kharkiv in the north.\n\nThe summit organizers have outlined three main agenda items: nuclear safety, including at the Russia-controlled Zaporizhzhia power plant; humanitarian assistance and the exchange of prisoners of war; and global food security, which has been affected at times due to blocked shipments through the Black Sea. This agenda covers some of the least controversial issues and falls short of the proposals laid out by Zelenskyy in a 10-point peace formula in late 2022. \n\nPutin’s government wants any peace deal to be based on a draft agreement negotiated early in the war, which included provisions for Ukraine’s neutral status and limits on its armed forces, while postponing discussions about Russia-occupied areas. Ukraine's efforts over the years to join the NATO military alliance have aggravated Moscow.\n\nWith much of the world’s focus recently on the war in Gaza and national elections in 2024, Ukraine’s supporters want to refocus attention on Russia’s violation of international law and the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity. The International Crisis Group, an advisory firm working to end conflict, stated this week that “absent a major surprise at the Bürgenstock,\" the event is “unlikely to deliver much of consequence.” However, the Swiss summit provides an opportunity for Ukraine and its allies to emphasize what the U.N. General Assembly recognized in 2022 and reiterated in its February 2023 resolution on a just peace in Ukraine: Russia’s full-scale aggression is a blatant violation of international law.",

In a statement Friday, the commissioner’s office said Hoberg has decided to appeal the penalty. MLB did not disclose the nature of the violation or the extent of the punishment.\n\n\"While MLB’s investigation did not find any evidence that games officiated by Mr. Hoberg were compromised or manipulated in any way, MLB determined that discipline was warranted,\" the statement read. \"Mr. Hoberg has chosen to appeal that determination. Therefore, we cannot comment further until the appeal process is concluded.\"\n\nMLB said it began investigating Hoberg during spring training, and he was removed from the field while the probe was ongoing. Hoberg, 37, umpired his first big-league game in 2014 and was added to the full-time staff in 2017. He received a perfect grade on calling balls and strikes when he worked the plate in Game 2 of the 2022 World Series between the Houston Astros and Philadelphia Phillies. \n\nHoberg also umpired in the 2023 World Baseball Classic and was chosen to work the plate for the Field of Dreams game in August 2021.

        "title": "Philippines seeks UN confirmation of its vast continental seabed in the disputed South China Sea",
        "body_text": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippines has requested a United Nations body to formally recognize the extent of its undersea continental shelf in the South China Sea, where it would have the exclusive right to exploit resources, the Department of Foreign Affairs announced Saturday. This move rejects China’s extensive territorial claims to the region.\n\nThe Philippine government submitted information to the U.N. Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf regarding the extent of its undersea shelf in the South China Sea, off western Palawan province, following more than a decade and a half of scientific research, the department said. China did not immediately comment but is expected to contest the Philippine move.\n\nThe area in question includes the Spratlys, a chain of islands, islets, reefs, and atolls that have been the subject of fierce disputes among China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan. Additionally, Indonesia has faced confrontations with Chinese coast guard and fishing fleets in the gas-rich Natuna sea, on the fringes of the South China Sea.\n\n“Incidents in the waters tend to overshadow the importance of what lies beneath,” Philippine Foreign Assistant Secretary Marshall Louis Alferez stated. “The seabed and the subsoil extending from our archipelago up to the maximum extent allowed by UNCLOS hold significant potential resources that will benefit our nation and our people for generations to come.”\n\n“Today, we secure our future by making a manifestation of our exclusive right to explore and exploit natural resources in our extended continental shelf entitlement,” Alferez added.\n\nUnder the 1982 U.N. convention, a coastal state can have exclusive rights to exploit resources in its continental shelf, a vast seabed stretch that can extend up to 350 nautical miles (648 kilometers), including the right to authorize and regulate any kind of drilling. The Philippines’ undersea continental shelf could overlap with those of other coastal states in the South China Sea, such as Vietnam. Philippine officials have expressed readiness to hold talks to resolve such issues based on UNCLOS.\n\nPhilippine permanent representative to the U.N. Antonio Lagdameo stated the move “can reinvigorate efforts of states to demonstrate their readiness to pursue UNCLOS processes in the determination of maritime entitlements and promote a rules-based international order.”\n\nHostilities and tensions in the disputed waters have escalated, especially between China and the Philippines, over two contested shoals since last year. Chinese coast guard ships and suspected militia vessels have used powerful water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers against Philippine coast guard patrol ships and navy boats. These actions have injured Filipino navy personnel, damaged supply boats, and strained diplomatic relations between the two countries.\n\nFollowing a tense standoff between Philippine and Chinese ships near a shoal in 2012, the Philippines took its disputes with China to international arbitration in 2013. The arbitration panel invalidated China’s claim to virtually the entire South China Sea in a 2016 ruling. However, Beijing refused to participate in the arbitration, rejected the decision, and continues to defy it.",

        "title": "Biden goes straight from G7 to Hollywood fundraiser, balancing geopolitics with his reelection bid",
        "body_text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — After flying through the night across nine time zones, from southern Italy to Southern California, President Joe Biden is shifting his focus from Russia’s challenge of Western unity to raking in big money for his reelection campaign at a Hollywood fundraiser featuring George Clooney and Julia Roberts. Biden went straight from the Group of Seven summit of wealthy democracies, where Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine took center stage, to Los Angeles and the glitzy gathering unfolding Saturday night at the Peacock Theater. The journey was only broken up by a layover to refuel outside Washington.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama is joining headliners Clooney and Roberts, and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel will interview all of them onstage. In a text message to donors beforehand, Roberts called it “a crucial time in the election.” Kimmel wrote in his own text that presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump “will hate this, so let’s do it.”\n\nLuminaries from the entertainment world have increasingly lined up to help Biden’s campaign, hoping to provide a fundraising jolt and energize would-be supporters to turn out ahead of Election Day against Trump. However, hobnobbing with stars this time means Biden is skipping a summit in Switzerland about ways to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. Vice President Kamala Harris is representing the United States. It’s a stark reminder that his responsibilities as president and his reelection effort can sometimes conflict.\n\n“We are going to see an unprecedented and record-setting turnout from the media and entertainment world,” Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood mogul, major Democratic donor and co-chair of Biden’s campaign, said in a statement.\n\nA Biden fundraiser in March at Radio City Music Hall in New York featured late-night host Stephen Colbert interviewing the president, Obama, and former President Bill Clinton. It raised a then-record $26 million, but the California event will bring in at least $28 million, according to the Biden campaign. Still, Trump has hauled in even bigger numbers. He outpaced Biden’s New York event in April, raking in $50.5 million at a gathering of major donors at the Florida home of billionaire investor John Paulson.\n\nThe former president’s campaign and the Republican National Committee announced they had raised a whopping $141 million in May, padded by tens of millions of dollars in contributions that flowed in after Trump’s guilty verdict in his criminal hush money trial. That post-conviction bump came after Trump and the Republican Party announced collecting $76 million in April, far exceeding Biden and the Democrats’ $51 million for the month and narrowing a fundraising advantage Biden built earlier in the race.\n\nWith Biden absent at the gathering on Ukraine, Harris is making the trip to Switzerland and back in a little more than 24 hours. At a joint appearance with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the G7 summit, Biden said Harris would be a strong representative of his administration at the meeting. But Zelenskyy previously suggested that it was “not a strong decision” for Biden to miss the event.\n\n“I would want President Biden to be personally present,” he said late last month, predicting that Putin would “stand and applaud” Biden not coming. Putin and Russian representatives also aren’t going to the summit.\n\nBiden’s fundraiser was expected to attract protests from pro-Palestinian activists angry about his administration’s handling of Israel.",

        "body_text": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has returned his Key to the City of New York at the request of Mayor Eric Adams, three weeks after a video surfaced showing Combs beating his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in 2016. On June 4, Adams sent a letter to Combs, informing him that the key had been rescinded and requesting its immediate return. Copies of the letter were mailed to Combs Enterprises LLC's offices in New York and Los Angeles. Fabien Levy, deputy mayor for communications, confirmed to Fox News Digital that the key was returned to the city on June 10.\n\n\"Like many people, I was deeply disturbed by recent footage of Sean 'Diddy' Combs assaulting his then partner,\" Adams wrote in the letter obtained by Fox News Digital. He continued, \"I strongly condemn these actions and stand in solidarity with all survivors of domestic and gender-based violence. Our city has worked tirelessly to make sure survivors are heard and seen by our administration.\"\n\n\"The Key to the City of New York is presented to individuals whose service to the public and the common good rises to the highest level of achievement, and who act as a model for fellow and future New Yorkers,\" Adams added. \"After internal deliberations, the Key to the City of New York committee recommended nullifying and rescinding Mr. Combs’ key.\" \"I have accepted their recommendation and am requesting that Mr. Combs immediately return his Key to the City,\" the mayor concluded. \"The city record will be updated to reflect our decision.\"\n\nCombs received the key from Adams during a ceremony in Times Square on Sept. 15, 2023. Representatives for Combs did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\n\nIn the 2016 surveillance video, obtained exclusively by CNN and released on May 17, Combs was seen wearing just socks and a towel around his waist as he brutally beat Ventura in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel. The video corroborated part of Ventura's November lawsuit against Combs. On Nov. 16, Ventura sued Combs in federal court, accusing him of physical and sexual abuse. However, she dropped the case after they reached an out-of-court settlement a day later.\n\nThe key is not the only accolade that Combs has lost since the shocking video surfaced. Last week, Howard University announced on June 7 that it had revoked the honorary degree conferred upon Combs following a unanimous vote by its Board of Trustees. \"Mr. Combs’ behavior as captured in a recently released video is so fundamentally incompatible with Howard University’s core values and beliefs that he is deemed no longer worthy to hold the institution's highest honor,\" read a statement posted on the university's website. \"The Howard University Board of Trustees voted unanimously to accept the return of the honorary degree conferred upon him in 2014,\" it continued. \"This acceptance revokes all honors and privileges associated with the degree. Accordingly, the Board has directed that his name be removed from all documents listing honorary degree recipients of Howard University.\"",

        "title": "How Biden and Trump are preparing for their first presidential debate",
        "body_text": "One is secluding himself at a mountainside retreat with a tight circle of advisers, poring over briefing binders, honing attack lines, and bracing for personal smears. The other is workshopping responses and retorts with vice presidential hopefuls, sharpening policy lines while working to rein in his bombastic rhetoric. \n\nIn some ways, aides to President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump describe similar goals heading into next Thursday’s presidential debate: painting their opponent as presiding over disorder and wholly unfit for office. For two men who have been circling each other rhetorically for the past four years, the debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta amounts to a moment of high consequence. \n\nBoth candidates are aware of the stakes as they huddle with their teams to prepare attacks, form rebuttals, and frame the choice of November’s election. Both teams have spent the past weeks working to fine-tune their message on a wide array of issues, from the economy to foreign affairs to their rival’s fitness for office. And each has found themselves distracted in some way: Trump by the criminal trial that consumed his spring and Biden by a stretch of intensive overseas travel and a painful legal saga for his family.\n\nYet the similarities mostly end there. How each man is preparing for the debate is ultimately a microcosm of their differences as candidates, and each will enter the CNN studio with divergent objectives. In prep sessions that have already started, Biden has been focused on ways to hold Trump accountable on the debate stage—mirroring the broader political strategy that his White House and campaign have been deploying for months.\n\n“The president has gotten increasingly punchier in recent remarks about Trump and plans to carry that theme through to the debate,” one Biden campaign official said. After months of suggesting that the American electorate was tuned out of the 2024 race, the Biden camp sees the debate as a starting block of sorts, and a chance to present its study of candidate contrasts in front of a new and engaged audience.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is aiming to assure voters he can be a steadier and more effective leader than his successor, despite the legal issues swirling around him and a deeply divisive approach to politics. Some of his debate prep has focused less on policy, but on rhetoric. Trump has previously struggled with policy debates, instead preferring to meander and generalize—especially without a teleprompter. He’s also been quick to show aggression in past debates, including speaking over his opponents and attacking the moderators, moves that stuck with viewers in the months that followed.\n\n“I’ll probably be negotiating with three people, but that’s OK. I’ve done that before,” Trump told his supporters Tuesday at a rally in Racine, Wisconsin, referring to Biden and CNN’s moderators. “I’ll be debating three people instead of one.”\n\nTo get ready, Biden is gathering trusted aides this week and next at Camp David, the mountainside presidential retreat, for several days of intensive discussion and preparation. The secluded complex of rustic lodges in Maryland has, in the past, helped focus Biden and his team ahead of important moments such as State of the Union speeches. The preparations are expected to progress over a series of days, evolving from informal discussions about topics, questions and potential responses.",

U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, earlier this month granted prosecutors' request to send Bannon to prison after a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld his conviction. Bannon's lawyers had asked the appeals court to allow him to remain free while he continues to fight the conviction all the way up to the Supreme Court, if necessary. Bannon was convicted nearly two years ago of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in efforts by Trump, a Republican, to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to Joe Biden, a Democrat.",

        "body_text": "Judges, state lawmakers, and voters are deciding the future of abortion in the U.S. two years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The June 24, 2022, ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization sparked legislative action, protests, and numerous lawsuits, placing the issue at the center of politics across the country. Abortion is now banned at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, in 14 Republican-controlled states. In three other states, it's banned after about the first six weeks, which is before many know they are pregnant. Most Democratic-led states have taken actions to protect abortion rights and have become sanctuaries for out-of-state patients seeking care. This has changed the landscape of abortion access, making it a logistical and financial ordeal for many in conservative states. However, it has not reduced the overall number of procedures performed each month across the U.S.\n\nHere’s what to know about the state of abortion rights in the U.S. now: \n\nBans in Republican-led states have prompted many people seeking abortions to travel to get care. This translates into higher costs for travel, hotels, meals, logistics such as child care, and more days off work. A new study by the Guttmacher Institute found that out of just over a million abortions provided in clinics, hospitals, and doctors’ offices, more than 161,000, or 16%, were for people who crossed state lines to get them. More than two-thirds of abortions done in Kansas and New Mexico were for out-of-staters, particularly Texans. Since Florida’s six-week abortion ban took effect in May, many people have had to travel farther since most states in the Southeast have bans. Low-income patients and those lacking legal permission to be in the country are more likely to be unable to travel. There can be lasting costs for those who do.\n\nIn Alabama, the Yellowhammer Fund, which previously helped residents pay for the procedure, has paused doing so after facing threats of litigation from the state. Jenice Fountain, Yellowhammer’s executive director, said she met a woman recently who traveled from Alabama to Georgia for an abortion but couldn’t get one there because she was slightly too far into her pregnancy. She then went to Virginia. The journey wiped out her rent money, and she needed help to remain housed. “We’re having people use every dime that they have to get out of state, or use every dime they have to have another child,” Fountain said.\n\nNearly two-thirds of known abortions last year were provided with pills rather than procedures. One report found that pills are prescribed via telehealth and mailed to about 6,000 people a month who live in states with abortion bans. They’re sent by medical providers in states with laws intended to protect them from prosecution for those prescriptions. The laws in Colorado, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont, and Washington specifically protect medical providers who prescribe the pills to patients in states with bans. The growing prominence of pills, which were used in about half of all abortions just before the Dobbs ruling, is a frontier in the latest chapter of the legal fight. The U.S. Supreme Court this month unanimously rejected an effort by abortion opponents who were seeking to overturn or roll back the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepr...",

        "title": "Trump proposes green cards for foreign graduates of US colleges, departing from anti-immigrant rhetoric",
        "body_text": "MIAMI (AP) — Former President Donald Trump said in an interview posted on Thursday that he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges, a sharp departure from the anti-immigrant rhetoric he typically uses on the campaign trail. Trump was asked about plans for companies to be able to import the \"best and brightest\" in a podcast recorded Wednesday with venture capitalists and tech investors called the \"All-In.\"\n\n\"What I want to do and what I will do is if you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country. And that includes junior colleges too, anybody who graduates from a college. You go there for two years or four years,\" he said, vowing to address this concern on day one.\n\nImmigration has been Trump’s signature issue during his 2024 bid to return to the White House. His suggestion that he would offer green cards—documents that confer a pathway to U.S. citizenship—to potentially hundreds of thousands of foreign graduates would represent a sweeping expansion of America’s immigration system that sharply diverges from his most common messages on foreigners. Trump has blamed immigrants who are in the country illegally for committing crimes, stealing jobs and government resources, and suggested that they are \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" He has promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history if elected.\n\nTrump and his allies often say they distinguish between people entering illegally versus legally. But during his administration, Trump also proposed curbs on legal immigration such as family-based visas and the visa lottery program. Right after taking office in 2017, he issued his \"Buy American and Hire American\" executive order, directing Cabinet members to suggest reforms to ensure that business visas were only awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers. He has previously said the H1-B program commonly used by companies to hire foreign workers temporarily—a program he has used in the past—was \"very bad\" and used by tech companies to get foreign workers for lower pay.\n\nDuring the conversation with \"All-In,\" Trump blamed the coronavirus pandemic for being unable to implement these measures while he was president. He said he knows of stories of people who graduate from top colleges and want to stay in the U.S. but can’t secure visas to do so, forcing them to return to their native countries, specifically naming India and China. He said they go on and become multibillionaires, employing thousands of workers. \"You need a pool of people to work for your company,\" Trump said. \"And they have to be smart people. Not everybody can be less than smart. You need brilliant people.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

        "title": "Trump proposed excluding tips from federal taxes. Here’s what that would mean for workers’ take-home pay—and budget deficits",
        "body_text": "What’s certain is that a change in the taxation of tips would affect millions. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates there are 2.24 million waiters and waitresses across the country, with tips making up a large percentage of their income. Here's a look at what Trump is proposing and the possible political and economic ramifications:\n\nTrump’s election-year pitch in Nevada: Trump announced his tax-free-tips plan at a June 9 rally in Nevada, a key battleground state with six electoral votes in the race for the White House. President Joe Biden won the state in 2020, but the Trump campaign hopes to put the state in play this fall. Nevada has the highest concentration of tipped workers in the country, with about 25.8 waiters and waitresses per 1,000 jobs, followed by Hawaii and Florida.\n\n“To those hotel workers and people who get tips, you are going to be very happy, because when I get to office we are going to not charge taxes on tips, people making tips,” Trump said at the rally. “... We’re going to do that right away, first thing in office.”\n\nThe pitch sets up a sharp political contrast between Democrats and Republicans. While Trump assumes that a tax cut would help workers, Democrats have generally endorsed efforts to increase hourly wages, and it’s an open question which approach resonates more with voters. The Culinary Union, which represents 60,000 workers in Las Vegas and Reno and is backing Biden, dismissed Trump’s plan as a stunt. \n\n“Relief is definitely needed for tip earners, but Nevada workers are smart enough to know the difference between real solutions and wild campaign promises from a convicted felon,” Culinary Union Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said in a statement.\n\nLael Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council, declined to speak to the idea floated by Trump because, as a federal employee, she's not supposed to talk campaign politics. “What I can say is that President Biden has fought for real solutions that actually address workers’ legitimate need for fair wages, we think, much more effectively,” she said, adding that tipped workers in Nevada would get a $6,000 income boost from a higher minimum wage and the elimination of the tipped minimum wage.\n\nHow would the tax exemption work? Trump has not specified whether he wants to exempt tips from just income taxes or from the payroll tax as well. The payroll tax funds Medicare and Social Security. For workers, a blanket exemption would mean more take-home pay. And for the federal government, it could mean larger budget deficits. \n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group, has estimated that exempting tips from both income and payroll taxes would reduce federal revenues by $150 billion to $250 billion over the next decade. The committee said exempting tips from taxation would also lead employers and workers to reclassify wages as tips where possible. The more that happens, the more that federal deficits would increase. A 10% increase in tips, for example, would bump up the committee’s projection for lost federal revenue to a range of $165 billion to $275 billion over the next decade.\n\nCongress undoubtedly would examine Trump’s proposal on tips as it considers which portions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are allowed to expire after next year, including the lower individual tax rates. Lawmakers are already prepping for the task, though Trump’s proposal is something that many had not thought about until recently.",

        "title": "Israeli strikes on tent camps near Rafah kill at least 25 and wound 50, Gaza health officials say",
        "body_text": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli forces shelled tent camps for displaced Palestinians north of Rafah on Friday, killing at least 25 people and wounding another 50 according to Gaza’s Health Ministry and emergency workers, in the latest deadly attack in the tiny Palestinian territory where hundreds of thousands have fled fighting between Israel and Hamas. According to Ahmed Radwan, a spokesperson for the Civil Defense first responders in Rafah, witnesses told rescue workers about the shelling at two locations in a coastal area that has become filled with tents. The Health Ministry reported the number of people killed and wounded in the attacks. The locations of the attacks provided by Civil Defense were just outside an Israeli-designated safe zone. The Israeli military said they were looking into the strikes at the reported coordinates. Israel has previously bombed locations in the vicinity of the \"humanitarian zone\" in Muwasi, a rural area on the Mediterranean coast that has filled with sprawling tent camps in recent months. The strikes came as Israel pushed ahead with its military operation in Rafah, where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge from fighting elsewhere in Gaza. Most have now fled Rafah, but the United Nations says no place in Gaza is safe and humanitarian conditions are dire as families shelter in tents and cramped apartments without adequate food, water, or medical supplies. Friday’s strikes took place less than a month after an Israeli bombing triggered a deadly fire that tore through a camp for displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza, drawing widespread international outrage — including from some of Israel’s closest allies — over the military’s expanding offensive into Rafah. Israel says it is targeting Hamas fighters and infrastructure and that it tries to minimize civilian deaths. It blames the large number of civilian casualties on fighters operating among the population. With Israel’s war against Hamas now in its ninth month, international criticism is growing over Israel’s campaign of systematic destruction in Gaza, at a huge cost in civilian lives. The top United Nations court has concluded there is a \"plausible risk of genocide\" in Gaza — a charge Israel strongly denies. Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 37,100 people in Gaza, according to the territory’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Israel launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which fighters stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250.",

        "body_text": "By LINDSAY WHITEHURST (Associated Press)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Steve Bannon, a longtime ally of former President Donald Trump, asked the Supreme Court on Friday to delay his prison sentence while he fights his convictions for defying a subpoena from the House committee that investigated the attack on the U.S. Capitol. The emergency application came after a federal appeals court panel rejected Bannon’s bid to avoid reporting to prison by July 1 to serve his four-month sentence. It was addressed to Chief Justice John Roberts, who oversees emergency appeals from courts in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe high court asked the Justice Department to respond to the request by Wednesday, days before the court is set to begin its summer recess. The court denied a similar request from another Trump aide shortly after receiving a response in March.\n\nBannon was convicted nearly two years ago of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Bannon has cast the case as politically motivated, and his attorney David Schoen has said the case raises “serious constitutional issues” that need to be examined by the Supreme Court.\n\nIf Bannon goes to prison next month, he will likely have to serve his full sentence before the high court has the chance to review those questions, since the court is due to take its summer recess at the end of June, attorney Trent McCotter wrote in his emergency application. His lawyer says the former adviser didn’t ignore the subpoena but was still negotiating with the congressional committee when he was charged. His previous attorney told him that the subpoena was invalid because the Republican former president has asserted executive privilege and the committee would not allow a Trump lawyer in the room.\n\nIn court papers, Bannon’s lawyers also previously argued that there is a “strong public interest” in allowing him to remain free in the run-up to the 2024 election because Bannon is a top adviser to Trump’s campaign. Bannon’s prison term has been delayed as he appealed. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols ordered him to turn himself in after an appeals court panel upheld his contempt of Congress convictions.\n\nA second Trump aide, trade adviser Peter Navarro, was also convicted of contempt of Congress. He reported to prison in March to serve his four-month sentence after the Supreme Court refused his bid to delay the sentence. Courts have rejected his executive-privilege argument, finding Navarro couldn’t prove Trump had actually invoked it.\n\nBannon is also facing criminal charges in New York state court alleging he duped donors who gave money to build a wall along the U.S. southern border. Bannon has pleaded not guilty to money laundering, conspiracy, fraud and other charges, and that trial has been postponed until at least the end of September.",

        "title": "FDA approves first menthol e-cigarettes, citing potential to help adult smokers",
        "body_text": "By MATTHEW PERRONE (AP Health Writer) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized the first menthol-flavored electronic cigarettes for adult smokers, acknowledging that vaping flavors can reduce the harms of traditional tobacco smoking. The FDA said it authorized four menthol e-cigarettes from Njoy, the vaping brand recently acquired by tobacco giant Altria, which also sells Marlboro cigarettes. The decision lends new credibility to vaping companies’ longstanding claim that their products can help blunt the toll of smoking, which is blamed for 480,000 U.S. deaths annually due to cancer, lung disease, and heart disease.\n\nParent groups and anti-tobacco advocates immediately criticized the decision, which comes after years of pushing regulators to keep menthol and other flavors that can appeal to teens off the market. “This decision could mean we’ll never be able to close the Pandora’s box of the youth vaping epidemic,” said Meredith Berkman, co-founder of Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes. “FDA has once again failed American families by allowing a predatory industry to source its next generation of lifetime customers — America’s children.”\n\nYouth vaping has declined from all-time highs in recent years, with about 10% of high schoolers reporting e-cigarette use last year. Of those who vaped, 90% used flavors, including menthol. All the e-cigarettes previously authorized by the FDA have been tobacco-flavored, which isn’t widely used by young people who vape. Njoy is one of only three companies that previously received the FDA’s OK for vaping products. Like those products, the menthol varieties come as cartridges that plug into a reusable device that heats liquid nicotine, turning it into an inhalable aerosol. \n\nNjoy’s products accounted for less than 3% of U.S. e-cigarette sales in the past year, according to retail data from Nielsen. Vuse, owned by Reynolds American, and Juul control about 60% of the market, while hundreds of disposable brands account for the rest. Most teens who vape use disposable e-cigarettes, including brands like Elf Bar, which come in flavors such as watermelon and blueberry ice.\n\nAltria’s data showed Njoy e-cigarettes helped smokers reduce their exposure to the harmful chemicals in traditional cigarettes, the FDA said. The agency stressed the products are neither safe nor “FDA approved,” and that people who don’t smoke shouldn’t use them.\n\nFriday’s action is part of a sweeping FDA review intended to bring scientific scrutiny to the multibillion-dollar vaping market after years of regulatory delays. Currently, the U.S. market includes thousands of fruit- and candy-flavored vapes that are technically illegal but are widely available in convenience stores, gas stations, and vape shops. \n\nThe FDA faced a self-imposed court deadline at the end of this month to wrap up its years-long review of major vaping brands, including Juul and Vuse. Those brands have been sold in the U.S. for years, awaiting FDA action on their scientific applications. To stay on the market, companies must show that their e-cigarettes provide an overall health benefit for smokers, without significantly appealing to kids. \n\n“Based upon our rigorous scientific review, in this instance, the strength of evidence of benefits to adult smokers from completely switching to a less harmful product was sufficient to outweigh the risks to youth,” said Matthew Farrelly of FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products.",

        "body_text": "A Pennsylvania couple vacationing in Florida with their six children drowned on Thursday after getting caught in a rip current, local authorities reported. The family of eight was visiting the beach on Hutchinson Island – a barrier island on Florida's southeastern coast – when the parents and two teenage children were swept out by a rip current while swimming, according to the Martin County Sheriff's Office. While the two teens managed to escape the current, their parents, identified as Brian Warter, 51, and Erica Wishard, 48, could not. \n\n\"The kids were able to break the current and attempted to help their parents, but it became too dangerous and they were forced to swim ashore,\" the agency wrote on Facebook. Warter and Wishard were located by Martin County Ocean Rescue responders, who began CPR on shore before the couple was transported to Cleveland Clinic North by Martin County Fire Rescue paramedics.\n\n\"Those life-saving efforts continued in the ambulance and at the hospital where doctors gave it every last effort before declaring the couple deceased,\" the MCSO said. Hutchinson Island's informational travel page on Facebook posted about the tragedy late Thursday and shared the following tips on how to avoid and escape rip currents:\n\n1. If the flag at the beach is red, do not go in the water.\n2. Watch the water before jumping in, even on green flag days.\n3. Don't enter the water where waves aren't breaking.\n4. Always watch the water as rip currents shift.\n5. If you get caught in a rip current, do not panic and try to fight it. Float, wave for help, and/or swim parallel to the shore.\n\n\"These signs are posted at every single beach, guarded and unguarded. Please, if you’re visiting, go to a guarded beach first.

        "title": "Teamsters president will speak at the Republican National Convention",
        "body_text": "By MEG KINNARD (Associated Press)\n\nCHAPIN, S.C. (AP) — The president of the Teamsters Union is set to speak at next month’s Republican National Convention, as Donald Trump aims to chip away at President Joe Biden’s support among blue-collar workers. These workers are expected to play a major role in the general election, particularly in crucial Midwestern swing states like Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump announced that O’Brien had “accepted my invitation to speak at the RNC Convention in Milwaukee.” Teamsters spokesperson Kara Deniz stated that O’Brien had requested speaking slots at both major party conventions and accepted Trump’s invitation for the RNC. This will mark the first time a Teamsters president will speak at a GOP event. DNC officials have not yet responded regarding whether O’Brien will speak at their event.\n\nTrump has been trying to make inroads among Biden’s support from organized labor heading into the general election. Union members tend to vote Democratic, with 56% backing Biden in 2020, according to AP VoteCast. In September, while his GOP rivals met for a debate, Trump traveled to Michigan and sought to win over autoworkers by criticizing Biden’s push for electric vehicles during a strike. Trump urged the United Auto Workers to endorse him, appealing directly to union president Shawn Fain; however, he spoke from a nonunionized auto-parts plant. Fain instead called Trump a “scab,” a derogatory term for workers who cross union picket lines, and endorsed Biden.\n\nIn January, Trump called on UAW members to oust Fain after the group endorsed Biden. Meanwhile, O’Brien has met privately with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club, where they discussed issues including right-to-work laws that allow workers in unionized workplaces to opt out of paying dues and fees. Trump described their January meeting with Teamster leaders as “very productive,” acknowledging that the union typically backs Democrats but said, “Stranger things have happened” regarding a potential endorsement. O’Brien later described the meeting with Trump as “pleasant” and “direct” but noted the union was far from making a decision.\n\nAfter meeting with Biden in March, O’Brien said the president has been “great” for workers but emphasized that “there’s still a lot of work to be done” to bolster unions. Biden has long billed himself as the most labor-friendly president in history, even joining a picket line in Detroit during the autoworkers strike last fall. He has already received significant organized labor backing, with early endorsements from the AFL-CIO and others. However, Trump is hoping to cut into that support by positioning himself as pro-worker and trying to exploit divisions between union leaders and some rank-and-file members.\n\nThe Teamsters union represents 1.3 million workers, including UPS drivers, film and television workers, freight operators, law enforcement, and other government workers. It backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020, although O’Brien has emphasized that the union is keeping an open mind on endorsements this cycle. The group generally waits until after both parties’ summer nominating conventions to make a formal endorsement and will “most likely” do so a...",

        "title": "Judge dismisses charges in Nevada fake electors case over venue question, attorney general to appeal",
        "body_text": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — A Nevada state court judge dismissed a criminal indictment on Friday against six Republicans accused of submitting false certificates to Congress declaring Donald Trump the winner of the state’s 2020 presidential election. The judge ruled that state prosecutors chose the wrong venue to file the case. Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford announced plans to take the case to the state Supreme Court, stating, “The judge got it wrong and we’ll be appealing immediately,” but offered no additional comments.\n\nDefense attorneys claimed the case was effectively over. They argued that bringing the case to another grand jury in a different venue, such as Carson City, would violate a three-year statute of limitations on filing charges that expired last December. “They’re done,” said Margaret McLetchie, attorney for Clark County Republican party chairman Jesse Law, one of the defendants.\n\nThe trial, initially scheduled for next January, has now been called off. Defendants included state GOP chairman Michael McDonald; national party committee member Jim DeGraffenreid; national and Douglas County committee member Shawn Meehan; and Eileen Rice, a party member from the Lake Tahoe area. Each faced charges of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged instrument, felonies carrying penalties of up to four or five years in prison.\n\nDefense attorneys argued that Ford improperly brought the case in Las Vegas instead of Carson City or Reno, which are closer to where the alleged crime occurred. They also accused prosecutors of failing to present evidence that could have exonerated the defendants and claimed their clients had no intent to commit a crime. All but Meehan have been named by the state party as Nevada delegates to the 2024 Republican National Convention next month in Milwaukee. Meehan’s defense attorney, Sigal Chattah, said her client “chose not to” seek the position. Chattah ran as a Republican in 2022 for state attorney general and lost to Ford by just under 8% of the vote.\n\nFollowing the court hearing, Brian Hardy, attorney for Hindle, declined to comment on calls from advocacy groups urging his client to resign from his position as overseer of elections in northern Nevada’s Story County. These calls were reiterated at a news conference held outside the courthouse by leaders of three organizations.\n\nNevada is one of seven presidential battleground states where slates of fake electors falsely certified that Trump had won in 2020 instead of Democrat Joe Biden. Others include Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Criminal charges have been brought in Michigan, Georgia, and Arizona. In 2020, Trump lost Nevada to Biden by more than 30,000 votes, and the state’s Democratic electors certified the results in the presence of Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican. Her defense of the results as reliable and accurate led to her censure by the state GOP, but her investigation found no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud in the state.",

        "title": "South Korea summons Russia's ambassador over Moscow's new pact with North as inter-Korean tensions keep rising",
        "body_text": "Seoul, South Korea — South Korea summoned the Russian ambassador to protest Moscow's new defense pact with North Korea on Friday as tensions at the Koreas' heavily fortified border continued to rise with vague threats from Pyongyang and brief, seemingly accidental incursions by North Korean troops.\n\nEarlier Friday, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued a vague threat of retaliation after South Korean activists flew balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets across the border. South Korea's military said it had fired warning shots the previous day to repel North Korean soldiers who briefly crossed the rivals' land border for the third time this month. This came two days after Moscow and Pyongyang reached a pact vowing mutual defense assistance if either is attacked, and a day after Seoul responded by saying it would consider providing arms to Ukraine to fight Russia's invasion.\n\nSouth Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Hong Kyun summoned Russian Ambassador Georgy Zinoviev to protest the deal between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un and called for Moscow to immediately halt its alleged military cooperation with Pyongyang. Kim stressed that any cooperation that directly or indirectly helps the North build up its military capabilities would violate U.N. Security Council resolutions and pose a threat to the South's security and warned of consequences for Seoul's relations with Moscow. Zinoviev replied that he would convey Seoul's concerns to his superiors in Moscow, the ministry said. Reuters reports that Zinoviev said he told Kim threats and blackmail against Moscow over its growing ties to Pyongyang are unacceptable.\n\nLeafletting campaigns by South Korean civilian activists in recent weeks have prompted a resumption of Cold War-style psychological warfare along the inter-Korean border. The South Korean civilian activists, led by North Korean defector Park Sang-hak, said they sent 20 balloons carrying 300,000 propaganda leaflets, 5,000 USB sticks with South Korean pop songs and TV dramas, and 3,000 U.S. dollar bills from the South Korean border town of Paju on Thursday night. Pyongyang resents such material and fears it could demoralize front-line troops and residents and eventually weaken Kim Jong Un's grip on power, analysts say.\n\nIn a statement carried by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency, Kim Yo Jong, one of her brother's top foreign policy officials, called the activists \"defector scum\" and issued what appeared to be a threat of retaliation. \"When you do something you were clearly warned not to do, it's only natural that you will find yourself dealing with something you didn't have to,\" she said, without specifying what the North would do.\n\nAfter previous leafletting by South Korean activists, North Korea launched more than 1,000 balloons that dropped tons of trash in South Korea, smashing roof tiles and windows and causing other property damage. Kim Yo Jong previously hinted that balloons could become the North's standard response to leafletting, saying that the North would respond by \"scattering dozens of times more rubbish than is being scattered on us.\" In response, South Korea resumed anti-North Korea propaganda broadcasts with military loudspeakers installed at the border for the first time in years, to which Kim Yo Jong, in another state media statement, warned that Seoul was \"creating a prelude to a very dangerous situation.\"\n\nTensions between the two Koreas remain high as the situation continues to develop.",

        "title": "Battle of the experts: Trump legal backers facing off against government over special counsel's 'legitimacy'",
        "body_text": "FORT PIERCE — When U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon convenes court in the U.S. government’s classified documents case against former President Donald Trump on Friday, the proceedings may sound more like a law school colloquium than a defense-prosecution hearing. Besides prosecutors working for the government and attorneys arguing for Trump and co-defendants Waltine Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, a lineup of third-party lawyers will appear in a federal courtroom in Fort Pierce to discuss the constitutionality of Special Counsel Jack Smith’s appointment to take the former president to court over his alleged mishandling of classified documents and efforts to block the government from retrieving them. It’s a question that many critics believe should have been disposed of quickly months ago by the judge, who was reportedly asked by two other Southern District of Florida judges to step aside from the case in favor of a more experienced jurist. Cannon was said to have rejected the suggestions, according to anonymous attorneys quoted by The New York Times. The daylong hearing on Friday at the Alto Lee Adams, Sr. United States Courthouse will focus on arguments similar to those rejected by other judges in challenges to special counsels Robert Mueller, who investigated Trump’s relationship with Russia, and David Weiss, who has been prosecuting President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, on gun and tax charges. On Monday, Cannon is scheduled to hear a related defense challenge of Smith with the focus on the funding of his office. That question, too, has failed to gain traction with other judges. On Tuesday, Cannon is scheduled to hear arguments on whether a federal judge in Washington, D.C. improperly allowed testimony from onetime Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran, under a crime-fraud exception to attorney-client privilege. Smith has alleged Trump misled the lawyer during his bid to obstruct the government’s investigation. Trump has pleaded not guilty first to a 37-count indictment handed up last June and again to additional charges in a superseding indictment returned later. His co-defendants, Nauta, a personal valet, and De Oliveira, a Mar-a-Lago property manager, also have pleaded not guilty. Critics of the judge assert that Cannon has effectively bought into a defense strategy of delaying a trial until after the November presidential election. She has conducted lengthy hearings on issues, they say, that most other judges would have quickly ruled upon after reviewing written motions filed with the court. Instead, Cannon canceled a May 20 start date for a trial, declaring there are numerous pretrial issues to decide including more than a half dozen motions to dismiss, as well as a variety of disputes between Trump’s lawyers and the prosecutors over the handling of classified documents at trial. Recently, the judge has rejected some dismissal motions, saying it is too early in the proceedings to consider them, or more appropriately presented as jury instructions. The defense had challenged counts related to obstruction and false statements that they said were duplicative and prejudicial. But Cannon said in an order that “the identified deficiencies, even if generating some arguable confusion, are either permitted by law, raise evidentiary challenges not appropriate for disposition at this juncture, and/or do not require dismissal even if technically deficient, so long as the jury is instructed appropriately and presented with adequate evidence.”",

Upon postponing the trial, Cannon scheduled deadlines for reports on June 10 and 17 and a non-evidentiary hearing on a motion to dismiss on Friday, \"based on unlawful appointment and funding of special counsel.\" Cannon expanded Friday's hearing to allow amici to argue before the court, as well as Trump defense attorneys and federal prosecutors.\n\nFormer Attorney General Ed Meese, who served under former President Reagan, filed an amicus brief in the case, arguing that Attorney General Merrick Garland’s appointment of Smith as special counsel—a private citizen at the time—violates the appointments clause of the Constitution. Garland appointed Smith as special counsel on Nov. 18, 2022, just days after Trump announced he would run for president in 2024. \"Not clothed in the authority of the federal government, Smith is a modern example of the naked emperor,\" the brief states. \"Improperly appointed, he has no more authority to represent the United States in this Court than Bryce Harper, Taylor Swift, or Jeff Bezos,\" they argued.\n\nMeese argues that the \"illegality\" of Smith’s appointment is \"sufficient to sink Smith’s petition, and the Court should deny review.\" Meese and his co-signers noted in the brief that Smith was appointed \"to conduct the ongoing investigation into whether any person or entity (including former President Trump) violated the law in connection with efforts to interfere with the lawful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election or the certification of the Electoral College vote held on or about January 6, 2021.\"\n\nGarland defended his move earlier this month during a hearing on Capitol Hill, arguing that \"there are regulations under which the attorney general appoint special counsel. They have been in effect for 30 years, maybe longer, under both parties.\" Garland argued that other special counsel appointments he and other attorneys general have made cite a regulation pointing to a statute.\n\nMeese, however, in his briefs filed in several points in the Trump cases, argued that \"none of those statutes, nor any other statutory or constitutional provisions, remotely authorized the appointment by the Attorney General of a private citizen to receive extraordinary criminal law enforcement power under the title of Special Counsel.\" Meese’s brief was even mentioned in a question by Justice Clarence Thomas in the Supreme Court oral arguments over Trump's presidential immunity in Smith’s other case regarding 2020 election interference, which the high court is expected to decide this month.

        "title": "FAA investigates low-flying Southwest Airlines flight near Oklahoma City",
        "body_text": "WASHINGTON — The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced today that it is investigating a Southwest Airlines flight that descended to a low altitude 9 miles (14.5 km) from the Oklahoma City airport. The incident involving Southwest Airlines Flight 4069, which had departed from Las Vegas, occurred around 12:05 a.m. Wednesday, the FAA said. An air traffic controller alerted the flight crew after the automated Minimum Safe Altitude Warning sounded. Southwest stated that it is following its Safety Management System and is in contact with the FAA to “understand and address any irregularities with the aircraft’s approach to the airport.”\n\nSeveral incidents involving Southwest flights in recent months have raised concerns. Asked on Monday if these incidents would prompt the agency to increase scrutiny of Southwest, as it has with United Airlines, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker declined to comment. He stated that the agency reviewed all airline incidents and closely monitored carriers. “The airline oversight model is a pretty good model that we want to build out for other players in the system,” Whitaker said.\n\nLast week, the FAA and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board announced they were investigating a May 25 Southwest flight of a Boeing 737 MAX. The NTSB reported that the plane experienced a “Dutch roll” at 34,000 feet while en route from Phoenix to Oakland, California. These lateral asymmetric movements are named after a Dutch ice-skating technique and can pose serious safety risks.\n\nThe FAA also stated last week that it was investigating a Southwest 737 MAX 8 flight in April that came within about 400 feet of the ocean off the coast of Hawaii. Bad weather conditions had prompted pilots to bypass a landing attempt at Lihue airport on the island of Kauai. During the go-around, the first officer “inadvertently pushed forward on the control column while following thrust lever movement commanded by the autothrottle,” according to a June 7 airline memo, and the plane began to descend rapidly, reaching a maximum descent rate of about 4,400 feet per minute. The pilots, in a post-debrief, described seeing the severity of the flight “through the animations as a significant, emotional event,” the Southwest memo said, adding that the airline is reviewing data and trends related to its procedures, training, standards, and performance.",

You can find them here: Forbes Today's 'Connections' Hints And Answers For Friday, June 21 by Kris Holt. \n\nHey, folks! I hope your weekend is off to a smashing start. Let’s keep the good times going by maintaining your Connections streak. Today’s NYT Connections hints and answers are coming right up.\n\nHow To Play Connections:\nIn Connections, you’re presented with a grid of 16 words. Your task is to arrange them into four groups of four by figuring out the links between them. The groups could be things like horror movie franchises, a type of verb, or rappers. There’s only one solution for each puzzle, and you’ll need to be careful when it comes to words that might fit into more than one category. You can shuffle the words to perhaps help you see links between them. Each group is color-coded: yellow is usually the easiest to figure out, blue and green fall in the middle, and purple is typically the hardest. The purple group often involves wordplay, so bear that in mind.\n\nSelect four words you think go together and press Submit. If you make a guess and it’s incorrect, you’ll lose a life. If you’re close to having a correct group, you might see a message telling you that you’re one word away, but you’ll still need to figure out which one to swap. If you make four mistakes, it’s game over. Let’s make sure that doesn’t happen with the help of some hints, and, if you’re really struggling, today’s Connections answers.\n\nWhat Are Today’s Connections Hints?\nScroll slowly! Just after the hints for each of today’s Connections groups, I’ll reveal what the groups are without immediately telling you which words go into them.\n\nToday’s 16 words are:\nFRANK STRING WOOD RING DOG FOG TRAIN BIRDS CHAIN LINK IRON BRAT DRIVER OMEN SERIES WEDGE\n\nAnd the hints for today’s groups are:\nYellow group — sequence\nGreen group — stalwarts of The Open\nBlue group — scary pictures\nPurple group — these are all bangers, so to speak\n\nWhat Are Today’s Connections Groups?\nNeed some extra help?

        "title": "South Korea says it fired warning shots after North Korean soldiers made a third temporary incursion.",
        "body_text": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s military said it fired warning shots Thursday to repel North Korean soldiers who temporarily crossed the land border for the third time this month. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said several North Korean soldiers, while engaged in construction work on the northern side of the border, briefly crossed the military demarcation line around 11 a.m. Thursday. The South Korean military responded by broadcasting a warning and firing warning shots, prompting the North Korean soldiers to retreat. Detailed information was not immediately released.\n\nSouth Korea’s military believes the previous two border crossings this month were not intentional, as the North Korean soldiers retreated after the warning shots, and North Korea has not returned fire. The South has noticed increased North Korean construction activity in frontline border areas since April, such as installing suspected anti-tank barriers, reinforcing roads, and planting land mines.\n\nA South Korean activists' group said Friday it flew large balloons carrying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets toward North Korea, adding to a campaign that has aggravated tensions between the rivals. The group, led by North Korean defector Park Sang-hak, said it floated 20 balloons with 300,000 propaganda leaflets, 5,000 USB sticks with South Korean pop songs and TV dramas, and 3,000 U.S. dollar bills from the South Korean border town of Paju on Thursday night. Pyongyang resents such material, fearing it could demoralize front-line troops and residents, and eventually weaken leader Kim Jong Un’s grip on power. \n\nAfter previous leafletting by Park’s group and other South Korean activists, North Korea launched more than 1,000 balloons that dropped tons of trash in South Korea, causing property damage. In retaliation, South Korea resumed anti-North Korea propaganda broadcasts with military loudspeakers at the border for the first time in years. Pyongyang warned that Seoul was “creating a prelude to a very dangerous situation.”\n\nTensions between the Koreas are high as Kim accelerates his nuclear weapons development and strengthens his regional position by aligning with Russian President Vladimir Putin against the U.S.-led West. On Thursday, South Korea’s government condemned an agreement by Kim and Putin in which their nations vowed to defend each other in case of war. Seoul said it will consider sending arms to Ukraine to fight Russia’s invasion. South Korea has provided humanitarian aid and joined U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow but has not directly supplied arms to Ukraine, citing a policy of not providing weapons to countries in active conflict.\n\nPutin said in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Thursday that supplying weapons to Ukraine would be “a very big mistake” for South Korea.

        "body_text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (KGO) -- Major League Baseball honored Negro League baseball with a game between the San Francisco Giants and St. Louis Cardinals on Thursday, at the historic Rickwood Field Ballpark in Birmingham, Alabama. It was even more meaningful because it came just days after the passing of Giants legend Willie Mays, who started his baseball career there. This event was originally intended to honor Mays' career and life, and now fans are also mourning his passing.\n\nRELATED: Fans pay tribute to Willie Mays at San Francisco's Oracle Park\n\nThe game, which MLB called \"A Tribute to the Negro Leagues,\" was meant to honor the legacy of Mays and other Black baseball greats who left an enduring mark on the sport. ABC7 Sports Anchor Chris Alvarez was there to chronicle the day. Fans came out to celebrate Willie Mays and other Negro Leaguers in several events and festivities around the historic Rickwood Field. The celebration started hours before the game and continued into the pregame ceremony.\n\nMLB planned a week of activities around Mays and the Negro Leagues, including an unveiling ceremony on Wednesday of a Willie Mays mural in downtown Birmingham.\n\nRELATED: New mural honoring Willie Mays unveiled in Birmingham ahead of historic MLB game at Rickwood Field\n\nYou could hear the celebration at Rickwood Field on Thursday even before arriving at the ballpark with the rapid thumping of a drum echoing from inside the ballpark, excited murmurs from fans skipping toward the music, and frequent bursts of laughter. Inside, there were reminders of history all around. There were photos and artifacts of baseball Hall of Famers who played at the 114-year-old ballpark, including Jackie Robinson, Josh Gibson, and Satchel Paige. The original clubhouse of the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues, where Mays got his pro start in 1948, was open. A memorial of Mays was at the front, with bobbleheads, a signed glove, and his Black Barons and San Francisco Giants jerseys on display.\n\nOutside, fans stood in line to hold a baseball bat used by Mays in 1959. They took photos sitting inside an original bus from 1947 that was typically used during barnstorming tours by Negro Leagues teams. They danced to live music and ate food from concession stands featuring menu boards designed to reflect the look and feel of the 1940s.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

His wife, Princess Kate, celebrated his birthday on June 21 by sharing a photo of him jumping in the air with their three children, Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte, on a Norfolk beach in England.

        "body_text": "Two-time Olympic gold medalist Lilly King was already having a week to remember. Then, an unexpected moment of joy happened on Thursday night. King, 27, had already won the 100-meter breaststroke earlier in the week at the U.S. Olympic swimming trials in Indianapolis, qualifying for the 2024 Paris Summer Games. On Thursday night, she finished second behind Kate Douglass in the 200-meter breaststroke, qualifying for that race as well. However, it was what happened after that race that really shocked her. \n\nHer boyfriend, James Wells, was caught on camera proposing to her. The answer was a resounding yes. Wells, a former swimmer at the University of Indiana where they both attended, delivered a touching speech as King looked on in astonishment. She admitted someone had told her to put her hair down for the moment. \n\n“Just to see you grow has been so awesome and I don’t regret for a minute dropping my job and moving halfway across the country for us to move in together. It has been awesome and I am very excited to see where this is going. So, dear, I was wondering, Lillia Camille King, will you marry me?” Wells asked. \n\nWells got down on one knee as he waited with bated breath for King's answer, which was a yes. The two shared a hug and a kiss, all caught on NBC cameras. Fellow swimmer Ryan Murphy didn’t see the moment but, once she heard about the news, called it “unbelievable.” \n\n“I didn’t see it,” Murphy said. “That’s unbelievable.

        "title": "Where to watch Peru vs. Chile: Copa America live stream online, TV channel, prediction, odds, TV channel",
        "body_text": "Peru and Chile aim for a strong start to their Copa America journeys on Friday when they face each other in Arlington, Texas during the tournament's opening weekend. Although expectations are low for both teams, after finishing in the bottom three of CONMEBOL's 10-team World Cup qualifying campaign in 2023, they are both seeking redemption. Recent managerial changes have improved their form, and this faceoff will set the tone for their prospects in the Copa America and serve as a measure of their progress. Here's what you need to know before tuning in.\n\n**How to watch and odds**\n- Date: Friday, June 21\n- Time: 8 p.m. ET\n- Location: AT&T Stadium, Arlington, Texas\n- TV: Fox Sports 1\n- Live stream: Fubo (try for free)\n- Odds: Peru +330; Draw +210; Chile +100\n\n**Group A outlook**\nConsidering defending continental and world champions Argentina are in this group, the other teams—including Canada—are likely competing for second place. The three teams are close in FIFA rankings, suggesting each has a chance to advance from the group in closely-contested matchups. The stakes are high in matches not involving Argentina, with three valuable points at stake. Even goal differential in games against Lionel Messi and company could be crucial in determining who makes it to the quarterfinals.\n\n**Storylines**\n\n**Peru:**\nThe Copa America brings back memories for Peru, who were runners-up in 2019 and semifinalists two years later. However, recent struggles have left them at the bottom of the World Cup qualifying table with zero wins in six games, prompting a managerial change to Jorge Fossati. Fossati has managed to steady the team, making them undefeated in all four games this year and outscoring opponents seven to one. Goalkeeper Pedro Gallese has been a standout. However, Fossati's Peru has yet to be tested against stronger opponents, so the Copa America will be a proving ground.\n\n**Chile:**\nChile are just eight years removed from winning back-to-back Copa America titles, but their golden generation is nearing retirement, and they missed the last two World Cups. They currently sit eighth in World Cup qualifying with only one win in six games, leading to a managerial change from Eduardo Berizzo to Ricardo Gareca. Gareca has gotten the best out of the group so far, with 3-0 wins against Albania and Paraguay and a narrow 3-2 loss to France. Chile's recent form suggests they might be able to make an impact at the Copa America, but it is still early in Gareca's tenure.\n\n**Prediction**\nChile's upward trajectory under Gareca, despite just three games in charge, seems convincing enough that they might be the better team in their Copa America opener against Peru. Considering Chile's scoring ability, expect them to net a few goals on Friday and start the tournament with a win. Pick: Peru 0, Chile 2",

        "body_text": "Nebraska has its share of rural areas; farms and ranches cover 92% of the state’s total land area. What’s the best way to get home internet in such remote areas? Aside from T-Mobile and HughesNet (our picks listed above for best rural internet and best satellite internet), here are some of the rural internet options you may encounter in Nebraska.\n\nKinetic: DSL internet like that of Windstream’s Kinetic uses telephone lines, which are much more readily available in rural areas than cable or fiber connections. Kinetic internet starts at just $40 a month for speeds up to 100Mbps, although most locations will see slower speeds.\n\nNextlink: A close second to T-Mobile in terms of wireless coverage in Nebraska, NextLink is available to many households in the eastern half of the state. Available speeds and pricing vary by location, but it’s possible to get speeds of 500 to 2,000Mbps starting at $30 to $100 a month.\n\nRise Broadband: Another wireless provider, Rise Broadband is available to around a quarter of Nebraska households, primarily in the southern and eastern parts of the state. Maximum speeds aren’t quite as fast as T-Mobile or NextLink, but the starting price isn’t bad at $55 a month and unlimited data is included.\n\nStarlink: A fleet of low-orbiting satellites gives Starlink a speed and latency advantage over HughesNet and Viasat, although the pricing is still sky-high. Expect an equipment cost of $499 to get started and an ongoing monthly rate of $120.\n\nViasat: Like HughesNet, Viasat is available throughout all of Nebraska. Pricing is a bit higher, but you may be able to get faster speeds and a higher data allowance with the added cost.",

        "body_text": "It would have made sense if an NBA team in need of some offensive firepower in the backcourt gave Malik Monk a big contract this offseason. One of the top unrestricted free agents on the market, Monk was viewed as the exact type of bucket getter who could end up commanding big money. As it turns out, Monk isn’t going anywhere. According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, the Sacramento Kings took advantage of the exclusive negotiating window teams have with their own free agents to give Monk a 4-year deal worth $78 million, which he intends to sign. Monk is coming off of the most productive season of his career as a member of the Kings, one which saw him finish as the runner-up for the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year award. He averaged 15.4 points and 5.1 assists per game, both of which were the highest marks of his career, and was an important part of head coach Mike Brown’s rotation despite coming off the bench in every game he played this season. After spending the first four years of his career as a member of the Charlotte Hornets and making a pit stop in Los Angeles as a member of the Lakers, Monk joined the Kings on a 2-year deal last offseason, where he was reunited with one of his teammates in college at the University of Kentucky, De’Aaron Fox. Now, he’s getting the chance to cash in on how his stint in Sacramento has gone up to this point.",

        "title": "Gold bars and Sen. Bob Menendez's curiosity about their price takes center stage at bribery trial",
        "body_text": "By LARRY NEUMEISTER (Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Prosecutors displayed to jurors at Sen. Bob Menendez’s trial multiple instances when he researched the value of gold while allegedly trying to assist a New Jersey businessman who authorities say bribed him with gold and cash. The evidence about the senator’s online searches was prominently presented to a New York jury as prosecutors detailed his text messages and internet queries in connection to Fred Dabies, a prominent New Jersey real estate developer who is also on trial.\n\nThe evidence is seen as crucial in the government’s attempt to prove that Menendez and his wife received gold bars, cash, and a luxury car from 2018 to 2022 in exchange for favors Menendez supposedly provided. Menendez, Dabies, and another codefendant, Wael Hana, have pleaded not guilty. Nadine Menendez, the senator's wife, also pleaded not guilty and faces trial at a later date due to recovering from breast cancer surgery. Another businessman pleaded guilty prior to trial and testified against the defendants.\n\nA significant part of the trial has focused on gold bars found in the home Menendez shared with his wife in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, highlighted when an FBI agent described a 2022 search of the residence. The search uncovered gold bars worth over $100,000 and more than $486,000 in cash, some hidden in coat pockets and shoes. A Mercedes-Benz, which prosecutors claim was a bribe, was found in the garage.\n\nOn Thursday, the matter of gold repeatedly emerged as another FBI agent described Menendez’s internet searches for gold prices at various times from April 2019 to May 2022. Agent Paul Van Wie noted that Menendez had never searched for gold prices before April 2019.\n\nDefense lawyers argued that the gold bars belonged to Nadine Menendez and that the senator was unaware of the gifts she accepted due to financial difficulties. However, prosecutors aimed to prove with emails, text messages, and online searches that Menendez was interested in gold prices while allegedly assisting Dabies in securing favorable outcomes to his legal issues and helping him obtain a $95 million investment from a Qatari investment fund. \n\nProsecutors presented email and text correspondence indicating Menendez introduced Dabies to a member of Qatar's royal family and took actions favorable to Qatar’s government amid real estate negotiations.",

UFC 305 is currently scheduled for Perth, Australia, while UFC 306 is at The Sphere in Las Vegas.

        "title": "Donald Trump dwarfs Joe Biden in latest fundraising numbers after felony convictions",
        "body_text": "NEW YORK — Donald Trump’s campaign outraised President Joe Biden by more than $60 million last month, according to federal filings made public Thursday that detailed the Republican fundraising explosion sparked by Trump’s felony convictions. Biden’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee together raised a robust $85 million in May and reported $212 million in the bank at the end of the month. The strong showing does not include roughly $40 million raised by Biden and his top surrogates in recent days or a separate $20 million donation from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to pro-Biden groups. Still, Trump’s fundraising, for one month at least, seemed to dwarf Biden’s. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee said they raised a jaw-dropping $141 million in May, including tens of millions donated immediately after Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in the New York hush money case. At the same time, billionaire Timothy Mellon donated a stunning $50 million to a pro-Trump super PAC the day after Trump’s guilty verdict, according to filings made public Thursday. Trump’s campaign declined to report how much money it had in the bank at the end of May, prompting Biden’s campaign to question whether the groups were still spending heavily to cover Trump’s legal fees. “Our strong and consistent fundraising program grew by millions of people in May, a clear sign of strong and growing enthusiasm for the president and vice president every single month,” said Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez. “The money we continue to raise matters, and it’s helping the campaign build out an operation that invests in reaching and winning the voters who will decide this election — a stark contrast to Trump’s PR stunts and photo-ops that he’s pretending is a campaign.” Taken together, the numbers detailed in the campaigns’ latest Federal Election Commission filings suggest that Democrats may still maintain a cash advantage in the 2024 presidential contest. But almost four months before Election Day, Trump’s side is closing the gap — if it isn’t closed already. The new fundraising figures also underscore the extent to which the rules of presidential politics are being re-written in the Trump era. At almost any other time in U.S. history, a presidential candidate would have been forced to leave an election after being convicted of dozens of felonies. But in 2024, Trump’s guilty verdict has instead fueled a massive fundraising surge that puts his team in a position to ramp up advertising and swing state infrastructure just as voters begin paying closer attention to the election. Backed by Mellon’s massive donation, the pro-Trump super PAC known as MAGA Inc. reserved $3.5 million in television advertising set to begin July 3 across Georgia and Pennsylvania on Thursday, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. Overall, the group reported a $68.8 million haul for May, ending the month with $93.7 million in the bank. Mellon has been among the biggest donors to Trump and independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., although his support for Kennedy may be fading. Kennedy raised $2.6 million last month and finished May with $6.4 million in the bank. The vast majority of his fundraising total came from running mate Nicole Shanahan, a wealthy Silicon Valley lawyer. The Kennedy campaign spent more than it raised for the month. The numbers reported on Thursday did not include anything raised in June, including roughly $40 million raised in...",

        "body_text": "Will Jason Kelce finally be making his Eras Tour debut? The former Philadelphia Eagles star, 36, was photographed in London on Friday ahead of Taylor Swift’s concert at Wembley Stadium. Kelce was seen posing for photos with fans in a pub, wearing his usual brown shawl neck sweater, shorts, and flip-flops. One user commented, “Jason Kelce in London??? Oh, tonight is about to go OFF.” Others joked about wanting to see him “shirtless, drunk, and shouting the lyrics,” reminiscent of his famous moment at the Kansas City Chiefs game against the Buffalo Bills. \n\n“i just KNOW we’re about to get so many new Jason Kelce memes in the VIP tent oh boy,” another fan added. Although his wife, Kylie Kelce, joined him at the Cannes Lions Festival earlier this week, she wasn’t seen in the London photo. Jason’s brother, Travis Kelce, started dating Swift last summer. However, neither he nor Kylie has yet to see one of her record-breaking concerts in person.\n\nIt’s unclear if the couple brought their daughters — Wyatt, 4, Elliotte, 3, and Bennett, 1 — with them. The former athlete recently talked about how Travis’ relationship with the “Cruel Summer” singer has impacted his role as a dad. While speaking at Stagwell Sport Beach, the brothers mentioned how the support from Swifties contributed to the success of their “New Heights” podcast. Jason said he enjoys helping girls get involved in sports and bringing dads and daughters together. He noted that the podcast has allowed the pop culture and sports worlds to “collide, which is awesome.”\n\nAfter the panel, the brothers flew to the United Kingdom, where Travis will reunite with Swift after a month apart. Also in London, Swift’s friend Keleigh Teller shared a post, hinting that the event will be star-studded. Unlike Jason and Kylie, Keleigh has attended several Swift concerts with her husband, Miles Teller, including back-to-back shows in New Jersey in May 2023. The “All Too Well” singer is set to play three shows in London before moving on to Dublin.",

        "title": "Oilers vs. Panthers Betting Props: Stanley Cup Final Game 5 Best Bets",
        "body_text": "Hockey fans officially have a compelling Stanley Cup Final. Going into Game 6 on Friday night at Rogers Place at 8 p.m. ET on ABC, Florida -- despite one-sided losses in Games 4 and 5 -- is -350 to win the series, and Edmonton is +280 at BetMGM. At DraftKings, Florida is -345 to hold on and raise the Stanley Cup, while Edmonton remains a series longshot at +270.\n\nThe way Edmonton won Game 4 -- blowing out Florida 8-1 after chasing Sergei Bobrovsky -- gave Oilers fans hope of a historic comeback from down 3-0. Sure enough, Connor McDavid and co. jumped out to an early lead on the road in Game 5, building a 4-1 cushion in the second period. The Panthers cut that lead to 4-3 late, but Edmonton got an empty-net goal late and held on to, in McDavid's words, \"drag Florida back to Edmonton\" for Game 6 on Friday night.\n\nFor Friday's matchup at what should be a raucous Rogers Place, the Oilers are slight favorites (-120 at FanDuel) to force Game 7, while Florida is even money. FanDuel's Over/Under is 5.5, as it has been for every game in this series (Over -106, Under -114).\n\nStanley Cup Final Game 6 Betting Analysis\nNote: the following admittedly gives no credit to the Panthers, who built a 3-0 lead and nearly came back from down 4-1 in Game 5. But it just feels unwise to bet against Edmonton right now, and not just because of Connor McDavid, who has a chance to complete a historic individual run through the playoffs with two more wins.\n\nMcDavid has 11 points in this series, including eight in Games 4 and 5 alone, and he's already set a new record for assists in a postseason, with 34 (and counting). Additionally, with 42 points and as many as two games remaining, he has a real chance to break another longstanding Wayne Gretzky record: most points in a single playoffs (47).\n\nThe Oilers have also dominated the special teams battle in the last two games of this series, with three power play goals and two more shorthanded, while Florida has not scored on the power play since Game 2. Between this version of McDavid, a power play that is clicking at the right time, a goalie, Stuart Skinner, who has quietly outplayed Bobrovsky over the last 120 minutes -- a development no one could have imagined after Games 1 and 2 -- and a rowdy home crowd, it's hard to shake the feeling that this series has Game 7 written all over it.\n\nWith that in mind, let's get to a few plays for tonight:\n\nPlay 1: Edmonton Puck Line: -1.5 (+215) at DraftKings\nUnfortunately, Edmonton to win at -120 doesn't offer a ton of value. The strong possibility of the Oilers' home crowd -- which helped them win Game 4 8-1 -- helping this team build a big lead makes this a great value play. Another reason to consider the puck line: even if the game is close, a one-goal lead late could very well cover this with another empty-net goal like the one McDavid bagged to ice Game 5.\n\nPlay 2: Connor McDavid Over 1.5 Points (-130) at DraftKings\nThere's a (justifiable) temptation to hammer a bigger number at a more lucrative price, but let's play it safe and go with McDavid to get to two points. This feels inevitable considering how many he's had game by game in this series: \n\nConnor McDavid Points \nGame 1: 0 \nGame 2: 1 (1 assist) \nGame 3: 2 (2 assists) \nGame 4: 4 (1 goal, 3 assists) \nGame 5: 4 (2 goals, 2 assists)\n\nPlay 3: Over 5.5 (-106) at FanDuel\nThe two low-scoring games to start this series feel like distant memories now. Following a seven-goal Game 3, Edmonton has turned the last two games into shootouts. The Oilers alone scored six goa...",

        "body_text": "The Stanley Cup will be in the building once again on Friday night with the Florida Panthers getting their third chance to win the first championship in franchise history in Game 6 against the Edmonton Oilers. The Panthers led the series 3-0 before losing back-to-back games. “There’s no way necessarily to prepare for that new experience,” Panthers coach Paul Maurice said Thursday in Fort Lauderdale before traveling back to Alberta. “Now, we’ve got kind of two games under our belt ... so we’re learning. We’re learning how to do this. We’re learning how to feel it.” \n\nTo close out the series and finally be atop the NHL, Florida will have to deal with Connor McDavid likely cruising to playoff MVP honors and a raucous sellout crowd of over 18,000 fans hoping to see their team force a Game 7 in South Florida on Monday night. Oilers fever is alive and well in the city of nearly a million people trying to will their team back across North America. \n\n“It’s been incredible to witness,” said veteran winger Corey Perry, who is in the final for the fourth time in five seasons. “Everybody notices it. You can hear them honking the horns when we’re in our dressing room. You can hear everything. It’s pretty special, pretty tremendous to be here and going through that.”\n\nThey are back in Edmonton thanks in large part to McDavid, Edmonton’s captain who had four points apiece in Games 4 and 5. He is the first player in league history with consecutive four-point games in the final, and his 42 are five shy of Wayne Gretzky’s record set in 1985. \n\n“Connor doing Connor things,” linemate Zach Hyman said. “That’s what makes him special. He’s able to elevate his game at the most important time — the biggest reason why we’ve come so far. We’re not here without him. He continues to drive the bus.”\n\nMatthew Tkachuk drove it for the Panthers in Game 5, the second-best player on the ice behind McDavid with a long gap to who might have been third. Tkachuk scored a goal and assisted on another, sparking a comeback bid that fell just short despite his diving save to keep the puck out of an empty net in the final minute. \n\n“He’s one of the best players in the world,” teammate Ryan Lomberg said. “He’s one of our main leaders. When guys like that lead by example, everybody else is well on board.”",

The Celtics, Patriots, Red Sox, and Bruins have all commemorated championships in recent years by jumping aboard the boats—amphibious vehicles usually used to show tourists the town sights. But in Boston, firing up the duck boats for a slow cruise down city streets has become synonymous with its feeling of sports supremacy.

Jetflicks operated as a subscription-based service allowing users to watch and download copyrighted TV shows and movies without permission. The defendants used Jetflicks to distribute hundreds of thousands of stolen television episodes, generating a content library larger than those of Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, and Amazon Prime combined. Users paid a $10 monthly fee to watch shows on multiple devices and platforms.\n\nThe five convicted individuals are Kristopher Dallmann, Douglas Courson, Felipe Garcia, Jared Jaurequi, and Peter Huber. They obtained content from pirate sites like SickRage, Sick Beard, SABnzbd, and TheTVDB, offering it to subscribers. Jetflicks claimed to have over 37,000 paid users and 183,200 television episodes, causing monetary harm to program owners estimated in the millions.\n\nAuthorities noted that Jetflicks faced issues similar to legitimate businesses, such as subscribers sharing logins. The group attempted to disguise the site as an entertainment service for aircraft flyers to avoid legal issues.\n\nSeven years after Jetflicks started, one member, Darryl Julius Polo, launched a competing service called iStreamItAll, which also offered unauthorized TV shows and movies. Polo pleaded guilty in 2019 to conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement and was sentenced to 4.75 years in prison, in addition to being ordered to pay $1 million.\n\nJetflicks had an organizational structure where Dallmann ran operations, Courson and Jaurequi handled management decisions, and programming and coding were managed by Dallmann, Polo, and Huber.",

Cx,” she captioned the snap, shared on X. \n\nElsewhere, King Charles also shared a special birthday tribute for his son. “Happy Birthday to The Prince of Wales!” the monarch, 75, wrote on X alongside a photo of himself holding baby William. William’s birthday celebrations come just one day after he traveled to Germany to watch England’s national soccer team take on Denmark in Euro 2024.

While Princess Catherine wasn’t at the event, her parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, were in attendance.

But this year's election stands to be so enormously consequential for women and families that, this time, I can't stay quiet,\" she said. \"Women deserve a leader who cares about the issues they face and is committed to protecting their safety, their health, their economic power, their reproductive rights, and their ability to freely and fully participate in a functioning democracy.\"\n\nFrench Gates, who recently stepped down as president of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said the contrast between Biden and his Republican opponent Donald Trump \"couldn't be greater, and the stakes couldn't be higher.\" \"I will be voting for President Biden,\" she concluded.\n\nReproductive rights have been an effective political cudgel for Democrats in the two years since the conservative-leaning Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that made abortion a constitutionally protected right. A comfortable majority of Americans think abortion should be legal in most cases, according to extensive polling, and around half of states have measures in place to protect access.\n\nThe issue has been a major theme of the election campaign, with Biden supporting women's right to choose and Trump failing to stake out a clear-cut position beyond pride in appointing three of the justices who struck down Roe v. Wade.\n\nFrench Gates announced in May that she would be using her $12.5 billion fortune to help \"women and families,\" making a first payment of $1 billion toward the cause. She said the Supreme Court ruling on abortion had prompted her to devote herself to defending women's rights.\n\nFormer New York mayor and businessman Mike Bloomberg also said on Thursday he was endorsing Biden and had donated $19 million to his campaign, according to the Washington Post.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, received high-profile support from investor twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who announced they had each donated $1 million toward the Republican candidate's election bid.

After the announcement, Charli posted a snippet from the song to her private 360_brat page, where Lorde can be heard singing, “Well honestly, I was speechless when I woke up to your voicemail when you told me how you’re feeling, let’s work it out on the remix.”\n\nOn the original track, Charli sings about her overthinking, insecure tendencies around her “awkward,” frenemy relationship with a fellow singer, whom she doesn’t “have much in common” with besides being two of the internet’s favorite artists. “People say we’re alike/They say we’ve got the same hair/We talk about making music/ But I don’t know if it’s honest,” sings Charli in the track’s pre-chorus before she repeats the refrain, “It’s so confusing, sometimes, to be a girl.”\n\nIn the second verse of the song, Charli references Lorde’s “Team” lyric — “I’m kind of over gettin’ told to throw my hands up in the air” — and sings to Lorde, “You’re all about writing poems, but I’m about throwing parties/Think you should come to my party and put your hands up.” After listening to Brat, fans quickly learned the song’s lyrics were likely friendly after Lorde was spotted attending Charli’s album release party in New York City. Charli also remixed Lorde’s song “Green Light” during her Party Girl DJ event in Mexico City Wednesday night.\n\nThe new track follows Charli’s release of a deluxe version of the album, titled Brat and it’s the same but there’s three more songs so it’s not, last Sunday. The new version of the LP included songs such as “Hello goodbye,” “Guess,” and “Spring breakers.” “On Brat, she stays out later and goes harder than ever before,” reads Rolling Stone’s review of the album. “And while she’s spinning around on the dance floor she’s also spiraling out in her head, digging deep into the types of insecurities and fears reserved for the comedown the morning after.”",

        "title": "Count Ymir quest and steps in Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree",
        "body_text": "The sorcerer Count Ymir is an NPC in Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC located in Manus Metyr Cathedral. Not only will Ymir teach you unique sorceries, but he also has a big quest that will earn you special gear, exclusive spells, and a strong spirit summon. Ymir’s quest also includes a major optional boss battle with a Boss Remembrance. Completing Ymir’s quest requires having access to much of the Shadow of the Erdtree’s map, including the Hinterlands and Cerulean Coast area. You’ll also need to acquire at least one of two items — an Iris of Grace or Iris of Occultation — to receive certain rewards from Ymir’s servant, Jolán. In this Elden Ring guide, we’ll show you every step of Count Ymir’s quest, including whether you should use the Iris of Grace or Iris of Occultation. Here’s a list of all the steps you need to go through in order to complete Ymir’s quest.\n\nManus Metyr Cathedral can be accessed after defeating Rellana, Twin Moon Knight at Castle Ensis and entering Scadu Altus. Starting from the Highroad Cross Site of Grace, head north to the guide stele and acquire the Scadu Atlus Map Fragment. Further north, at the fork in the road, turn right and head southeast to another site of grace at Moorth Ruins. At the southern end of the ruins, you’ll see a hole in the ground that leads to an underground cavern. You can safely jump down there using various ledges and rooftops, and take a tunnel pathway toward a new location, Bonny Village. From the Bonny Village site of grace, head east, over a small ravine and across two bridges, to reach another site of grace, Bridge Leading to the Village. From there, take the road north (past many wolves and a Furnace Golem) to yet another site of grace, Church District Highroad. The road then takes a southward turn and terminates at the Cathedral of Manus Metyr.\n\nYmir will be quietly sitting on the throne in the apse of Manus Metyr. Speak to him, and he’ll give you the Hole-Laden Necklace item and a Ruins Map that points toward your first destination: Finger Ruins of Rhia, west of Jagged Peak. When he’s not at his throne, Ymir can be found in a small graveyard connected to Manus Metyr. Speak to him there or at his throne to advance his dialogue and quest, resting at the cathedral’s site of grace to progress. Ymir will also teach you new glintstone sorceries. Check his stock to see if there’s anything new.\n\nYmir’s first Ruins Map points you to Finger Ruins of Rhia, west of Jagged Peak. The Finger Ruins of Rhia location is accessible from the Finger Ruins of Rhia Site of Grace. To get there, head northeast from the Cerulean Coast Cross Site of Grace, riding along the coast westward until you reach a giant stone slab ramp, on the other side of which is the Finger Ruins of Rhia Site of Grace. Finger Ruins of Rhia is a massive crater filled with Fingercreepers and Snakemen. Near the northern end of the crater is a ritual site of four standing stones shaped like fingers, with a Hanging Bell at its center. Simply walk up to the bell, where you’ll be prompted to “Sound the hanging bell.” You’ll receive the Crimson Seed Talisman +1. Once completed, return to Ymir, who will give you another Ruins Map.\n\nThe second Ruins Map points you to Finger Ruins of Dheo, east of the Hinterland in Scaduview. The Hinterland and Scaduview are accessible through Shadow Keep. From the Shadow Keep Back Gate Site of Grace, head north, where you’ll see a side passage to the east that leads to a headless statue of Marika.",

        "title": "Shiny monolith removed from mountains outside Las Vegas. How it got there is still a mystery.",
        "body_text": "By RIO YAMAT (Associated Press) LAS VEGAS (AP) — A strange monolith found jutting out of the rocks in a remote mountain range near Las Vegas has been taken down by authorities. Its discovery over the weekend and quick removal revived a pandemic-era mystery that captured the public’s imagination when similar objects began to appear around the world. How it got there is still a mystery.\n\n“It remains unknown how the item got to its location or who might be responsible,” Las Vegas police said Friday in a series of posts announcing the removal of the glimmering, 6-foot-4 rectangular prism. Its removal was quick, because it was illegally installed on federal land managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and because of concerns over public safety and the land, a wildlife refuge. \n\nMembers of the police department’s search and rescue team had discovered the object over the weekend near Gass Peak, part of the vast Desert National Wildlife Refuge where bighorn sheep and desert tortoises can be found roaming. It was the latest discovery in a series of mysterious shiny columns popping up around the globe since at least 2020. In November of that year, a similar metal monolith was found deep in the Mars-like landscape of Utah’s red-rock desert. Then came sightings in Romania, central California, and on the famed Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas. All of them disappeared as quickly as they popped up.\n\nThe Utah structure, believed to be the first in the series, had been embedded in the rock in an area so remote that officials didn’t immediately reveal its location for fear of people getting lost or stranded while trying to find it. Las Vegas police said the same concerns led them to tear down the latest monolith on Thursday afternoon. The department said it is being stored “at an undisclosed location” while authorities try to figure out the best way to dispose of or store the massive object made out of reflective metal sheets molded around the prism and secured with rebar and concrete.\n\nThe otherworldly structure evokes the object that appears in the Stanley Kubrick movie “2001: A Space Odyssey.” The Desert National Wildlife Refuge, which was established to protect bighorn sheep and is home to rare plants, is the largest wildlife refuge outside of Alaska and can cover the state of Rhode Island twice. Christa Weise, the wildlife refuge’s acting manager, confirmed Friday in a brief phone call with The Associated Press that the object was torn down but declined further comment.",

Wilson holds 217,773 votes to Clark's 216,427. Rounding out the top five are Fever's second-year forward Aaliyah Boston (171,864), New York Liberty forward Breanna Stewart (151,984), and Dallas Wings guard Arike Ogunbowale (130,838).

        "title": "How a German Olympian helped take on CrossFit to build Hyrox, the next-generation fitness race with 34,000% growth",
        "body_text": "As the race progresses, the music fades while the claps and cheers get louder. The participants, now glistening in sweat, need all the motivation they can get. When you scan the room, you will see all kinds of people—first-time Hyrox entrants to chiseled athletes, Gen Zs to baby boomers. The crowds cheering people in a gigantic arena make the race experience equal parts “cool” and serious business. Hyrox’s ingredients might sound familiar to any other fitness fad: a test of stamina and physical endurance lasting hours, a ticking clock, and a clear finish line. \n\nRaces aren’t new to sports—think Spartan Race and Tough Mudder, which have been around longer. Hyrox classifies itself as a fitness race different from its arch nemesis, CrossFit, a specific breed of training that’s technical and harder to master with Olympic weightlifting and gymnastic elements. But more importantly, it sets itself apart from the marathons and sporting championships of the world by asking a simple enough question: If going to the gym is a sport, how can we make something more of it? \n\n“There was a void in the world of sports,” Moritz Fürste, the co-founder of Hyrox and three-time German Olympian in field hockey, told Fortune in an interview. “It’s like this missing piece of the fitness world where people, for whatever reason, go to the gym every day, but they never compete.” Seven years on, Hyrox’s reputation precedes it around the world. While its first iteration in 2017 saw a meager 618 participants, the race has grown exponentially since, with the 2023/24 season closing with over 210,000 participants across 30 cities. \n\nThat’s despite a little blip called COVID-19 that kept people locked inside their homes for nearly two years. Hyrox keeps on growing. Fürste thinks what the race has achieved so far is just the tip of the iceberg as it continues to attract average gym-goers, accomplished athletes, and CrossFit enthusiasts alike, whether in Miami, Milan, or Melbourne.\n\nLeaping past the setbacks, Hyrox started with a stumble. It was about 10 years ago when Fürste and his business partner and Hyrox’s CEO Christian Toetzke first met. They were instrumental in Germany’s campaign to host the 2024 Olympics and Paralympic Games. Despite a persuasive pitch, Hamburg’s residents voted against hosting the games in a 2015 referendum. “We went from opening bottles of champagne to literally closing them again and giving them back to the supermarket,” Fürste said of the day they learned about the referendum. But if sport teaches you one thing, it’s to never stop at the first stumble.\n\nFürste and Toetzke, a sporting events veteran, continued discussing ways to collaborate. While looking for ideas, they came across a staggering statistic that most people identified working out at the gym as their “sport.” That left the duo with lingering questions—and a seed of an idea for what would later evolve into the Hyrox race we see today. “We were like, ‘Okay, interesting, but what the hell is your sport?’” Fürste said. “If you were to think of all the people that are officially a member in a gym, I think we’re talking about the biggest organized sport in the world.” Hyrox was born. \n\nRising above, once they had whipped the Hyrox model into shape, the next challenge was convincing people that, unlike other sporting events, it was indeed accessible. It offers various “divisions” based on age and fitness level to encourage more participants. With a couple of hundred racers in the first year and steadily growing numbers since, the vision for Hyrox has come to fruition, proving that the gym can indeed be more than just a place to workout—it can be a competitive sport.",

        "body_text": "Jason and Kylie Kelce are “Shaking It Off” in London! The former Philadelphia Eagles center, 36, and his wife, 32, were spotted by fans at night one of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour shows in London on June 21. The Kelces were seen wearing black shirts as they made their way into the VIP section at Wembley Stadium before the concert. Ross Travis, a close friend of Jason's brother Travis Kelce, was also spotted entering the VIP tent on Friday. Fans shared videos of Jason signing an Eagles jersey and a hat, and exchanging friendship bracelets. He was spotted with a full arm of bracelets soon after getting to their seats. \n\nWhile Travis has previously gone to Swift’s shows in South America, Australia, France, and Missouri, this is the first time Jason and Kylie have publicly attended the record-breaking tour. The “Love Story” singer was last publicly seen with Jason and Kylie at the Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas while cheering on Travis for his back-to-back Super Bowl wins. The three were spotted in a stadium box alongside Swift’s pals Blake Lively and Ice Spice. The couple’s attendance at the Eras Tour comes a day after Jason and Travis appeared on a panel at Sport Beach 2024 in Cannes in support of their podcast “New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce.” \n\nAt the event, Jason spoke about how the brothers have embraced Swifties as a new part of their fanbase and podcast's demographic. \"It's been fun for me, I have three little girls, so in some ways, the show and everything that's transpired over the past year, has given reasons for girls to get involved in a sport where previously there wasn't that much interest,\" Jason said at the panel. \"So all of a sudden, dads are hanging out with daughters and there's worlds colliding, and our show gets to be another place where worlds collide, and it's awesome.\" \n\nTravis first expressed interest in the “Cruel Summer” singer after attending her Eras Tour show at Missouri’s Arrowhead Stadium last July. He said on his New Heights podcast that he put his number on a friendship bracelet and had planned to give it to Swift after the show, but things didn’t go according to plan. “I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings. So I was a little butthurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her,” Travis joked on his podcast. \n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Swift and Travis later confirmed their relationship in September 2023, after the singer was spotted cheering on the Kansas City Chiefs at a home game. \n\nSwift is set to play two more shows in London this weekend before heading off to Dublin the following weekend for her next set of shows on the European leg of the tour. She will come back to Wembley Stadium on Aug. 15 for five more show dates. Swift is estimated to have 700,000 fans in attendance across all eight shows.",

The Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), which represents about 28,000 American Airlines flight attendants, stated it has moved closer to a strike as the airline did not present a favorable agreement. However, the flight attendants cannot strike until the National Mediation Board (NMB) grants them permission. The board must first determine that both parties are at an impasse and that further bargaining would not be productive. This lengthy and complex process makes it difficult for airline workers to strike. Last year, the NMB denied a request from the union to be released from federal mediation. American Airlines, in an emailed statement to Reuters on Thursday, said it will continue to negotiate with the union so that its flight attendants benefit from the contract. \"This agreement is within reach and we look forward to additional dates being scheduled,\" the airline spokesperson said. The current round of negotiations started in January 2020 but was paused at the height of the pandemic, resuming in June 2021. Earlier this month, the airline had offered its flight attendants immediate wage increases of 17% in their new contract, which was later unanimously rejected by the APFA.",

        "title": "What to expect in South Carolina's state primary runoffs",
        "body_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — South Carolina will hold runoff elections on Tuesday to decide a handful of races in which no candidate received a majority of the vote in the primary held just two weeks earlier. In the 3rd Congressional District, a candidate backed by former President Donald Trump faces off against the preferred candidate of Republican Gov. Henry McMaster in a contest that will likely determine who will succeed retiring GOP U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan. Voters in the June 11 primary narrowed the crowded Republican field down to pastor Mark Burns and nurse practitioner Sheryl Biggs. Burns has Trump’s endorsement and was the top vote-getter in the primary, with about 33% of the vote. Biggs placed second with about 29%. Biggs has McMasters’ backing while also prominently featuring photos of herself with Trump on her campaign website. Biggs slightly outraised Burns for the cycle, but Burns had almost triple the campaign cash Biggs had available heading into the primary. The winner will face Democratic nominee Byron Best, the manager of a paint store in Greenwood. Both Burns and Biggs would be heavily favored in November in the safe Republican district. Trump won the area with 68% of the vote in 2020 and 67% in 2016. Duncan ran unopposed in 2022. Also on Tuesday’s ballot are eight state Senate and four state House runoffs. All 170 state legislative seats are up for election in November. Republicans enjoy lopsided majorities in both chambers.\n\nHere’s a look at what to expect on Tuesday:\n\nPRIMARY RUNOFF ELECTION DAY\nSouth Carolina’s primary runoff election will be held Tuesday. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nWHAT’S ON THE BALLOT\nThe Associated Press will provide vote results and declare winners in 13 runoff elections, including one U.S. House, eight state Senate, and four state House contests.\n\nWHO GETS TO VOTE\nRegistered voters may participate in a partisan primary runoff election if they voted in the same party’s primary on June 11 or if they did not vote in the primary. In other words, Republican primary voters can’t vote in a Democratic runoff or vice versa.\n\nDECISION NOTES\nThe 3rd Congressional District covers part or all of 11 counties, of which Anderson and Pickens tend to contribute the most votes. Trump carried both counties in the presidential primary with 69% and 68% of the vote, respectively. In the competitive 2018 Republican primary for governor, McMaster narrowly lost to Pickens but won a plurality of the vote in Anderson. He also won five of the counties in the southern half of the district by double-digit margins. \n\nThe AP does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why. In South Carolina, recounts are automatic if the margin between the winning and losing candidates is not more than 1% of the total vote. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.\n\nWHAT DO TURNOUT AND ADVANCE VOTE LOOK LIKE?\nAs of June 5, there were about 3.3 million registered voters in South Carolina. The state does not register voters by party. In the June 11 primary, turnout was 14% of registered voters.",
